[Second Chance Romance]

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.940
[Episode 14]

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.540
Yes.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.180
Okay.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.020
Ting.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.180
Ms. Zhuang.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.660
How's your foot?

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.490
Tomorrow is the last review.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.330
It's almost healed.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.460
Must get it checked thoroughly .

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.690
As a ballerina,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.180
don't take your foot injury lightly.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.130
Will Mr. Wang go with you?

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.380
He's been running around for you lately.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.060
I heard

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.690
you've known each other for a long time.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.780
Yes.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.780
Yes.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.570
Is he your good friend's brother?

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.450
Yes.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.820
No wonder.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.410
Then this relationship goes way back.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.940
Last time, as he donated,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.570
I knew he was doing it because of you.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.850
Now that you got injured,

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.260
he was more worried than I was.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.780
I think he's serious about you.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.730
There's

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.890
no such relationship between us.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.980
He's like my younger brother.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.890
I understand.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.130
When it comes to feelings,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.690
you know best

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.260
and must follow your own heart.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.170
I'm not an expert in this area,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.130
so I won't advise you.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.570
However,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.890
I hope for a relationship,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.610
you won't choose the hardest path,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.660
as you do with ballet.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.500
Be good to yourself.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.450
Sometimes, giving yourself a chance

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.820
isn't a bad thing,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.980
right?

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.570
Alright.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.380
Take care.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.170
Ms. Lin,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.500
how is her recovery?

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.130
She's recovering very well.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.890
Don't worry.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.340
Thank you, Ms. Lin.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.130
You're welcome.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.730
Still need to be careful later.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.130
Although it has recovered,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.060
she shouldn't run or jump.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.610
Also, don't walk too much,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.610
but a little walking is fine.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.340
Okay.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.780
And no strenuous exercise

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.340
or the like.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.060
Be careful.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.450
It's okay. The doctor said it's fine.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.610
You're more nervous than I am.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.610
This foot is so important to you.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.130
Ordinary people don't mind

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.940
even if we become lame.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.890
Yuan, thank you.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.450
How will you thank me?

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.690
I'll treat you to a big meal.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.690
Okay.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.410
When?

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.780
Come to my house tomorrow.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.340
I'll cook for you.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.820
Be careful.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.220
Careful.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.730
Where are we going today?

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.410
Let's open more blind boxes.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.580
Your taste

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.810
is very polarizing.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.810
Is it interesting?

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.170
Yeah.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.050
Do you like this place?

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.700
Yes.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.170
Your decor style

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.170
and this atmosphere

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.170
don't quite match the first impression

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.290
I had to you.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.290
I like things with contrast.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.580
So I have to get

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.170
to know you more in the future.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.610
How have you and Yuan been lately?

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.100
Interested in him?

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.250
No.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.900
You mentioned him
when you were drunk that day,

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.700
saying you weren't getting along.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.810
That day

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.610
when I was drunk,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.490
did I say nonsense?

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.900
Anything I shouldn't have?

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.700
No.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.610
You didn't want to talk,
so I didn't ask.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.930
Nothing serious.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.370
He likes someone who I feel

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.930
won't lead to a good outcome.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.460
And I'm afraid he'll get hurt,

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.340
but he won't listen to what I say.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.140
From a human perspective,

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.370
the closer someone is to you,

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.610
the more likely you are
to resist their advice.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.370
But Yuan will understand you.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.780
Things will get better slowly.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.930
After all,
blood ties can never be broken.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.140
Hopefully.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.020
Let me tell you,

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.490
if he hadn't bought me

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.370
my house,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.020
I'd have cut him off long ago.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.700
Don't say that.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.140
Look at me.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.700
Last year, I lost my only older brother.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.730
Sometimes

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.700
when I'm facing this world alone,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.700
I often think

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.020
how nice it would be to bicker

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.780
and fuss

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.020
with someone.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.580
Sorry, Zu.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.370
I shouldn't have said that.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.020
Shuhan,

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.810
I...

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.580
I know

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.370
maybe we're moving too fast.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:00.370
But,

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.250
but I never take things lightly.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.370
The day I met you,

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.140
I had a familiar feeling.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.490
It was like

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.140
I'd been searching for you
for a long time.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.370
I'm not asking you
to believe in love now,

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.580
but could you try

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.730
to trust me?

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.410
Shuhan's relationship this time

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.410
is different from usual.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.250
How so?

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.610
She's incredibly infatuated.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.020
Incredibly infatuated?

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.490
Yeah.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.340
She keeps talking to me

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.370
about

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.020
different things about Zu.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.100
It's so annoying.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.610
Has her IQ dropped?

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.140
Right.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.140
So annoying.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.850
But don't gossip about her

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.900
or bring up rumors to me,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.250
or I'll tell her.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.130
She won't let you go.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.130
I'm not scared.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.130
You can pass that along to her.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.010
So tasty.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.650
Absolutely!

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.650
Rivals any Michelin-starred restaurant.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:45.650
Alright, stop it.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.650
I know my own cooking skills.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.420
I'm very aware of my limits.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.490
I'm not exaggerating.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.530
Every word is true.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.370
And

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.850
since you cooked,

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.530
I'll do the dishes.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.010
Yuan,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.490
hold on a moment.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.010
I need to tell you something.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.100
I'm grateful for everything

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.980
you've done for me during this time.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.890
But now that my foot has healed,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:13.610
right?

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:14.850
So I think

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.370
we should

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.220
return to our own lives
and separate paths.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.650
Don't need to go out of your way

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.890
to look after me like before.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.490
I knew it.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.730
Inviting me here and cooking for me

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.370
wouldn't be that simple.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.530
No.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.010
The point is, you have to work

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.850
and handle your things.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.010
Don't waste time on me.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.890
So, this is the Last Supper, huh?

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.650
To be honest,

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.250
since I came back,

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.490
I'm truly, deeply grateful

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.370
to you for caring for me

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.490
and bustling about with my affairs.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.130
Especially in this past month,

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.490
if it weren't for you,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.340
with my injury,

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.250
I would've suffered so much more.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.890
I did all of this willingly.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.610
Don't keep thanking me.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.890
But I can't give you what you want.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.610
I'm not asking for anything special.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.300
Just like you said,

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.730
when you need someone by your side,

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.890
I can take care of you.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.220
Is that so difficult?

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.100
What I'm trying to say is,

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.530
if I've been holding you back,

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:25.770
I'll be very ashamed.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.010
I understand.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.010
Actually, in this past month,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.370
I'm very grateful to you.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.490
I was so happy.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:43.980
It felt like a dream,

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.370
so real.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.010
If only time would slow down a bit more.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.010
And I have a hope too.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.850
I hope we can be lifelong good friends.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.300
Of course.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.530
For life.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:02.980
Not a single day less.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:04.530
Come on.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.250
A toast to friendship.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.250
And to my best brother.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.490
Rest.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.300
I'll clean up.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.890
That won't do.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.220
It's fine.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.300
A healthy person

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.370
doesn't need help.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.890
Ting,

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:53.890
sorry.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.650
I got stuck in traffic on my way here.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.530
Late again.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.610
It's fine. I just arrived.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:58.730
I've ordered.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.460
You're looking great today.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.650
I haven't come to see you these days.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.220
How's your foot?

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.610
Recovered a couple of days ago.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.250
All good.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:08.890
Healed up?

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.010
Alright.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.370
How do you like this watch
I bought recently?

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:15.890
Is it nice?

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.980
Yes,

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.490
it suits you well.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:19.300
Oh, by the way,

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.420
have you ordered?

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.530
I just said

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.130
I had ordered.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:23.890
Oh, you ordered.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.980
Well, bring it on then. I'm hungry.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:26.610
What have you been busy with lately?

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.730
Just busy stuff, you know.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.610
You didn't answer my question.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.370
What have you been busy with lately?

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.010
Are you in love?

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.250
Is it that obvious?

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.980
It's written all over your face.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.220
I'm seeing someone.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.010
How's it going?

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.650
We're in the honeymoon phase now.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.010
Of course, it's the sweetest time.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:55.490
But the main thing is,

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.420
I used to feel like

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.130
love wasn't meant for me.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.370
I was ready to give up on it.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:00.490
But I never expected

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.980
that love was waiting for me.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.730
I think this one feels pretty solid.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.730
Your state seems pretty good.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.180
Congratulations.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.700
Different from those before.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.780
This place's food is good.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.060
Of course, I picked it.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:20.700
Siting,

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:21.940
how's

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.180
that thing going?

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.060
You know,

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:24.940
Le.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.460
I

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.420
saw him again later on.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:31.700
Recognized each other?

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.420
No.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.020
I think he's doing pretty well now.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:40.660
I don't know

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.660
if I should disturb him.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.260
If I suddenly tell him

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.420
that I'm his mother,

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.660
would it give him a huge shock?

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.180
So, I want

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.700
to sort things out clearly

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.700
and be fully prepared

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.660
before telling him.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.060
And he likes me quite a lot now.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.420
What do you think?

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:04.780
If I tell him

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.540
I'm his mother,

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:07.940
will he hate me?

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.940
Indeed.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.060
You need to think this through.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.700
I'm going to wrap things up at school.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.300
It'll take me a long time

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.540
to find my dad.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.300
This is the most important thing

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.820
for me right now.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.060
Tan Siting,

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.020
no matter what you do,

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.900
I'll support you.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.060
And whatever happens,

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:33.940
tell me.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.460
I'll be right there on the front line.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.300
Focus on your relationship.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.300
Staying in good spirits is helping me.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.780
Don't worry.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.300
When should I meet

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.300
this right one of yours?

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.580
Yeah.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.820
I'll bring him over when the time comes.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.260
Give him your thorough approval.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.580
Absolutely.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.180
Come on.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.660
Let me tell you,

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.140
I'm deeply in love with him.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.260
Congratulations to you.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.940
Hello. Whose drink is this?

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.060
Alright, watch.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.780
Cut this at this point.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.380
Got it?

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.180
Hello.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:21.660
Yes, fifteen drinks.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.340
Fifteen.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:21.580
Sorry.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.140
We're closed.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:22.980
Come back tomorrow.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:29.380
I made this.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:29.980
Try it.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.580
Thanks.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.380
It tastes good.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.620
Have you been doing well these days?

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:45.740
Not bad.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.500
Is work tiring?

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:49.860
Not really.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.740
Do you like your life now?

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.460
That's life.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.860
Taste its sweetness and bitterness.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.060
Have you tasted them?

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.260
How should I put it?

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.060
When I was nine,

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.740
my mother left me.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.340
On the day she left,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.700
I cried and clung to her waist,

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.740
begging her not to go.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.940
But in the end, she walked away.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.580
And after that?

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.380
My dad and I relied on each other.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.860
Even though I didn't have a mother,

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.860
I got all of my father's love.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.340
I know my dad would give

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.780
absolutely everything for me,

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.700
so even without my mother,

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.340
my dad

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.100
made sure I felt like

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.140
growing up in a complete

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.140
and warm home.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.140
Back then, I always believed

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.380
that in this lifetime,

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.300
I'd never be separated from my dad.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:18.940
Want to hear more?

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:24.620
Alright.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.140
I'll tell you everything.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.900
Twelve years ago,

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.700
something terrible happened.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.860
My dad suddenly

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.780
left me.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.660
And not long after that,

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.660
the person I loved most in my life

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.780
left me too.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.060
Suddenly, I had nothing.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.100
My whole world collapsed.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.100
Living was hard,

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.300
and I was lost.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.900
When I wanted to give up,

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.140
Ms. Zhuang told me...

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.340
Right now, you feel like

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.660
the whole world has abandoned you,

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.580
but that's just how you feel.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.340
Besides, don't forget,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.860
no matter what,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.780
you at least still have ballet.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.780
You're

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.100
an excellent ballerina.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.860
You're still that girl
who can't be crushed.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.340
Right?

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.300
So I put on my ballet shoes
without hesitation.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.340
No music,

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.780
no choreography,

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.100
only the pain and cries from within.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.180
After that period of time,

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.340
I felt

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.820
life was kind to me.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.700
I was fortunate.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.660
We'll encounter

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.900
various problems and difficulties.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.860
Many times, there are no solutions.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.700
But as long as I can dance,

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.660
I feel like I'm truly alive.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.660
Ballet

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.340
gave me a way to live.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.580
During the darkest days of my life,

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.860
ballet was like a brilliant beam

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.900
of light,

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.420
shining into my world.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.860
It turned my black-and-white life

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:12.780
into a colorful one.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.260
So dance requires experience.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.380
If not for that experience,

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.780

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.900
Of course!

That's what we've taught you.

Don't let them control you.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.020
This is Tan Siting.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.100
Ms. Tan.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.060
Hello.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:26.740
Hello, Ms. Tan.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:27.100
And this is

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:27.940
Ms. Guan.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:30.460
Hello.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.100
I've said thank you too many times.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.020
I'm

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.540
a lucky person.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.100
That such a serious disaster has drawn

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.100
so many friends willing to help.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.700
I'm truly touched.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.540
We're all friends.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:49.420
No need for formalities.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.020
You're being too modest.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:53.020
Mr. Feng,

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.220
we did that

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.580
because of your personal charisma.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.020
That's absolutely true.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.980
When we faced difficulties,

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.500
you didn't hesitate for a second

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.020
and helped us find outlets
for our grapes.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.540
Now that you're in trouble,

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.540
we have to help you
even if we're not selling anything.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:08.140
Well said.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.020
Mr. Feng,

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.900
as the most authoritative
wine publication

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.620
in the country,

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.100
we set high standards

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.020
for featuring locally made wines.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.900
Only Huacan from Mr. Wang's company

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.100
has been featured.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.020
However, Cygne's wine

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.580
has impressed me this time.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.580
A report will be arranged soon,

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.180
followed by online

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.620
and print media coverage.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:31.460
Then

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.180
I propose

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.140
we all raise our glasses

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.260
to wish Cygne continued success.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.180
- Good.
- Thank you.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:37.860
Thank you.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:38.500
You're welcome.

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.060
Congratulations, Mr. Feng.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:40.940
Wish you greater success.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.460
Greater success.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.140
May your business prosper.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:53.900
Excellent.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.740
Okay, for the seventh one.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.380
Then,

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.940
the speed is from 120

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.420
to 208.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:02.700
Class is dismissed.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:03.820
Okay.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:05.620
Tired?

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:08.620
Be careful.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:09.540
Or it may pinch your hand.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:12.620
Speed up gradually from slow to fast.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.340
Come on.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.140
Your dad's promotion event

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.500
was a huge success.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:18.900
Let me see.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.220
Rui.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.420
Dad looks quite cool in this shot.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.020
Look at his poise.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.060
Ms. Tan.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:31.820
Where?

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.620
The one dancing in the back here.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:35.500
This one.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:36.740
See it?

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.540
It's really her.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.580
Is this a collaboration
with the ballet school?

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:44.900
Possibly.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.220
Come on.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:47.740
Have some fruit.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:48.900
Try some of this.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.220
Okay.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:53.900
Here.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.540
Thank you.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:57.700
Thank you.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.820
It's great. Try that peppercorn.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.340
This bamboo shoot is excellent too.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:06.580
Are you not on a diet?

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.460
But a bit spicy.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:09.660
Ms. Tan,

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.100
I've heard so much about you.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.980
Finally, meet you in person.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:13.820
I feel so lucky.

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:14.860
You're not the only one!

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.100
My daughter is also a fan of yours.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.220
Unfortunately,

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.980
she's studying abroad right now.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.060
Otherwise,

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.820
she would have come with me today.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.900
May I take a photo with you later?

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.260
She asked me to complete the task,

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.740
and I must get it done.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:30.980
No problem.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.740
The year before last in Paris, France,

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.180
I saw Ms. Tan perform on stage.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.180
It was breathtaking.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.580
So today, I feel incredibly honored

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.060
to have dinner with Ms. Tan.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:44.580
So, let's make a toast.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:45.980
You flattered me.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:46.980
Here's to you.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.380
Thank you for your presence today.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.260
Let me toast you.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:50.900
Mr. Xu,

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.460
Ms. Tan doesn't drink much.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:53.820
Understood.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.100
I'll finish mine. Take your time.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.180
Ms. Tan finished it all!

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:01.460
Go easy on it.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.900
Ting, are you okay?

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:04.100
I'm fine, Ms. Zhuang.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.700
I wanted to have a little drink today.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:07.980
Ms. Chen, please eat.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:08.980
Look how thin you are.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:09.820
Eat more.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:13.700
Mr. Chen.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.060
Mr. Chen.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:16.860
Let me toast you.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.460
Nice to meet you.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.740
Let's have a drink together.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:25.140
Come on.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:25.460
Here.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:27.340
Ms. Qin.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:28.740
Alright, enjoy yourselves.

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:30.060
Yes.

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:30.940
Great.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.020
When are you coming to Shanghai?

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.460
You planned to open a branch in Shanghai

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.900
to compete with me, right?

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.500
Who told you that? No way.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.980
No way. Seriously.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.500
But to be honest,

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.060
I used

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.060
to think

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.100
that as Ms. Gao's eldest son,

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.420
you may not be involved in the business.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:51.740
Later on, I realized I was wrong.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.540
The new generation surpasses the old.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.420
With Cygne's current momentum,

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.740
soon you'll surpass Huacan.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.780
Actually,

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.340
when we were the most indecisive,

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.620
we decided to take a gamble

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.460
and trust our own judgment.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.460
In the end, we were quite lucky,

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.660
which led to a great collaboration.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:12.540
To be honest,

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:13.820
Huacan

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.340
is quite traditional,

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:16.580
from organizational structure

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.820
to management system.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.580
Should emulate innovative companies
like yours.

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.620
Your raw material cultivation technology

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.900
is more mature than ours.

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.660
Let's collaborate on a new wine,

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.900
and we'll call it Huacan Cygne.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:29.300
That's a great idea!

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:30.660
This will work!

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.020
The wine will be a great success.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.300
Come on. I'd like to make a toast.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.460
This is a powerhouse partnership.

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.020
Deal!

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.500
- A powerhouse partnership.
- Indeed!

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:40.020
Sir,

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.100
the documentary just aired,

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.020
and it's hit 500,000 views!

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:44.660
Let me see.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:45.020
And what's more…

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:45.660
we have more reason to drink now.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:46.540
It's all positive reviews.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.540
I'll take a look.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:48.740
Come on, let me see again.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.020
This is a great sign!

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.300
Come on, everyone.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.380
Let's propose

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.660
a toast to Mr. Feng.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.100
Congratulations!

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:55.660
A good omen.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:56.180
A good sign.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.180
Thank you.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:57.820
Congratulations, Mr. Feng.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:58.740
Thank you.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.740
Is this the wine Mr. Yu brought?

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:08.660
This is a remarkable wine.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:09.540
Thank you all so much.

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:11.220
There's no more wine.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:12.860
Waiter!

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.260
Bring us some baijiu.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:15.460
Don't drink anymore.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.020
Bring the baijiu?

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:17.020
So happy.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.380
I'm happy today.

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.260
We won't stop until we're drunk.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:26.420
Together.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.020
Come on.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:27.620
Here, Mr. Li.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.020
