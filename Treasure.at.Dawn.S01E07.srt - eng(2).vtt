Listen to its voice.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.310
Isn't it clearer than before?

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.390
It's definitely clearer than before.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.070
All thanks to your training, Chairman.

Come in.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.870
The humble Sun Siming,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.460
greets Mr. Chairman.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.260
I've already removed your slave status.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.550
Have Steward Zhao

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.070
take you to the accounting room to withdraw some money.

I don't want to see you in Xichuan again.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.390
I won't leave.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.630
So you wish to die?

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.150
It's precisely because I don't want to die

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.790
that I can't leave.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.870
I'm afraid as soon as I leave Xichuan,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.870
I'd be killed.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.880
You think I want to kill you?

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.220
I could have done it here in Xichuan.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.830
Yes, of course.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.790
If Mr. Chairman wants my life,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.790
it would be as easy as crushing an ant.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.550
But killing me

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.870
would cause you trouble.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.590
It's not worth it.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.900
You flatter yourself.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.390
I'm not overestimating myself.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.390
After all,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.550
I've been a horse slave of Song Jingye

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.070
for many years.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.180
He just died,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.070
and if I were to die now,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.980
certain people

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.790
would definitely make connections

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.900
between these two deaths.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.550
The dead don't speak,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.940
but if someone investigates this thread,

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.070
it could lead back to you.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.150
And then...

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.260
Are you threatening me?

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.150
I wouldn't dare, sir!

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.070
But if it because of my worthless life

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.630
that affects your future a bit,

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.420
it would be a net loss!

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.390
So, going by that logic,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.180
I should keep you alive.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.390
Me staying alive

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.870
won't cause you any trouble.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.590
And

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.870
I can still be of use to you.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.590
So tell me,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.150
what do you want to do?

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.870
Whatever you need,

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.030
I can do it.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.790
Take him down and tidy him up.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.390

There's no vacancy.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.700

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.070
and not noticing it,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.700

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.460

If he had asked me more,

I might have thought more highly of him.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.590

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.720
could you please inform the Young Mistress,

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.930
the carriage steward of Jibei Chamber of Commerce wishes a meet?

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.770
The Young Mistress is not seeing anyone.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.930
You haven't informed her yet.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.560
How do you know she won't see me?

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.860
Our Young Mistress is the second most noble person

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.920
in the entire Xichuan City.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.740
How could she know someone like you?

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.970
Get lost!

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.200
Sir,

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.680
I really have something urgent for the Young Mistress.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.120
Please inform her.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:40.850
Please.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:41.890
Get going.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.120
You're just a stable hand.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.810
How dare you come to the Lord's Mansion acting important?

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.770
Get out!

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.080
Out!

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.410
Who are you?

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.560
Here to see the Young Mistress?

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.890
It's nothing.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:09:59.910
Nothing.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:15.820
[Lord's Mansion]

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.000
Miss, I bought your favorite snacks.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.640
Miss, where are you going?

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:23.440
Just now, Jiu said

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.600
Fu Sheng and Gu Tian were captured.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:25.410
I need to find my father.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:26.480
Here, give it to me.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.640
These two,

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.920
are the ones who killed the Chairman Song.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.920
Today,

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.170
in front of all the brothers,

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.480
we'll give justice to the Chairman.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.000
Behead them.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.100
[Command]

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.640
They're about to be beheaded, how terrifying.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.480
Mr. Wen, what's the meaning of this?

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.520
You want to execute them without even a trial?

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.640
Vice Chairman Li,

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.250
aren't you being a bit too hasty?

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.330
We have both witnesses and evidence.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.720
The proofs are solid.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.970
What's the point of trial?

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.040
Since the evidence are solid,

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.490
why not,

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.520
show them to everyone?

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.330
First,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.640
these two can die with clarity.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:16.680
Second,

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.000
it'll also prevent any misunderstanding that Vice Chairman Li

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.120
is eager to execute

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.750
for some other reasons.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.160
Then let's do as Mr. Wen suggests.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:31.680
Qin Shi.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:36.640
Mr. Wen.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.560
I am Qin Shi,

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.410
the personal guard of Chairman Song.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.850
That night,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.330
these two were sneakily following Chairman Song.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.520
I stopped them near the Lin's Mansion.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.120
But shortly after,

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.680
at the Lin's Mansion,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.290
I was drugged and knocked out.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.680
Then Chairman Song,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.200
was killed.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.080
This Fu Sheng,

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.160
previously cured the poison of Xiangshui Lake.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.520
He's an expert in herbs.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:00.970
If it wasn't him,

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:01.850
then who could it be?

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.520
Is there any other evidences?

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:09.850
Present the physical evidence.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.160
This is the murder weapon found at the scene.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.410
What does this mean?

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.370
Take it.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.370
I believe trouble clings to you.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.970
We just arrived in Xichuan,

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.250
haven't even entered the gate,

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.530
and you've caused a such trouble.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.160
If Wen Jue hadn't arrived in time,

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.000
we would have died here.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.970
The Three Heroes of Xichuan.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.970
Tell everyone,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.370
where have you seen this?

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.370
Speak!

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.290
The Fortune Inn.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.200
Both the witnesses and physical evidence are present.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.370
Is Mr. Wen satisfied now?

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.330
Nonsense!

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.000
This dagger is mine.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.720
It was a gift from Fu Sheng.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.000
Father,

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.930
you must tell them.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.810
Indeed,

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.600
this dagger

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.720
was indeed gifted to my daughter by Physician Fu.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.450
However, as I've always disliked her handling weapons,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.770
I took it away and discarded it.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.040
Never did I imagine it would appear at the scene of the crime.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.000
Vice Chairman Li,

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.160
this time

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.120
you've really arrested the wrong person.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.030
It seems Lord Wen

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.250
is determined to protect the murderers.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.250
Since neither the witnesses nor material evidence counts,

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.890
then

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.160
it wouldn't be right to convict easily.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.970
How about this,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.000
from now on,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.770
my Lord's Mansion

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.160
will issue a bounty notice

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.000
together with Jibei Chamber of Commerce to capture the real murderer.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.450
And give Chairman Song justice.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.490
As for

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:08.750
these two

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.120

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.970
I will make decisions on their behalf.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.200
They are not allowed

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.490
to pursue the responsibility further.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:21.810
Alright,

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.330
since the matter is resolved,

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.640
we won't hold up Vice Chairman Li any longer.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.720
We'll be leaving now.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.370
Let's go.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:34.720
What's wrong, Father?

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.250
We'll talk back at home.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:36.930
Alright.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:39.970
Take them away.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:02.490

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.520

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.630
What did I just eat?

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.430
That's the pork you saw when you walked in.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.900
You're the first person to let me eat that.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.270
Don't worry.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:27.630
I've cleaned it up.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.590
Anyway,

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:31.900
what do you want to see me about?

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:37.660
Well.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.100
When will you treat my father?

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:48.750
I

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.460
was working on it.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.340
But

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.220
I still haven't figured it out.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.510
It's been so long.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.750
You still haven't figured it out.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.460
The medical skills are broad and profound.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.900
If you want to save people,

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.980
it takes time.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.950
Maybe it's because you're too stupid.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:08.830
I'm stupid?

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.190
My master never said I was stupid.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.960
He said I was a genius.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.190
That's because your master didn't meet me.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.460
If I had studied medicine,

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.740
I would have been much better than you.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:20.790
No way.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.220
Let's find out.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.070
Will you learn?

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:25.550
Just teach me.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.980
I can teach you now.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.100
Go ahead. I'm listening.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:32.980
Well.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.310
It's a joke.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:35.860
Do you really want to study medicine?

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.030
All right.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.190
Listen and study hard.

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.710
The medical skills are broad and profound.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.790
One wrong step leads to another.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:49.830
That way,

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.260
instead of saving people,

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.340
you'll kill them.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.100
Got it. Let's get started.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:55.830
Listen carefully.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.030
Medical practice means

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.070
are complex.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.460
Pulse feeling is the most important one.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.190
You can start with the pulse.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.500
The pulse beats the same as the heart.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.710
A normal person's pulse beats 60 to 100 times

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.030
every 15 breaths.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.220
The elderly have a slower pulse.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.500
It beats 55 to 60 times.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.190
The child's pulse

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.830
beats faster.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.580
It beats more than a hundred times.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.220
However, the heartbeats and pulses

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.620
of people who are sick and dying

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:26.460
are obviously different

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.580
from those of normal people.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:29.220
Really?

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.030
Absolutely.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:31.740
Have a try.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:34.710
Use three fingers.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.070
Right.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.980
Your heart is beating faster.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.030
Well.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.100
This is the basic content.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.950
I'll list some books for you.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:16.910
You should study hard.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.860
I'll check on your studies.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.310
Why is my pulse getting faster?

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.830
Palpitation?

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.670
It's impossible.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.990
I didn't eat anything wrong.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.340
How could I get palpitations?

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:56.940
This is the place I imagined.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.150
Why is there someone else's voice?

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:00.630
Am I crazy?

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:25.660
What are you looking at?

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.380
Duck.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.150
How can you speak?

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.220
You imagined everything in here.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.240
Why are you asking me?

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:39.670
No.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.320
No.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.830
I didn't cure my palpitations.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.030
Now I've lost my mind.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.470
You can imagine a duck talking.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.590
You're going to go crazy.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.670
I think I can heal myself.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.860
I'm sorry, it's so itchy.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.430
I couldn't help myself.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.790
Wood...

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:09.670
Man?

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.310
There's more?

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:15.460
There's less than half here.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.830
They're still bringing in the books.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.980
Princess, why do you need so many medical books?

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.790
Is this to cure the lord?

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:21.980
Yeah.

Look.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.380
Here's the list he gave me.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:31.670
I don't believe

You're a filial daughter.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.460
If the lord knows it, he'll be pleased.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.780
I didn't expect

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.290
that I would have to memorize so many books to study medicine.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.380
So,

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.260
according to our analysis,

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:54.620
I am not crazy.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.380
I was deeply influenced by others,

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.510
so I involuntarily made you up

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:00.910
in my mind.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.070
I think that's the case.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.860
Otherwise, you can't explain

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.830
why I sound

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.070
like Wen Jue,

What's your name?

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.740
I didn't expect you to be considered murderers.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.910
Hand me over to the Chamber of Commerce.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.220
Or you can take me to the official.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:37.630
I beg you to take care of my sister.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.630
Don't let her be harassed again.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.670
Forget it.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.020
Wait. Where are you going?

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.630
You're not going to take him to the official, right?

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.980
When I saw him, I thought of Gu Bao and Gu Liang.

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.780
Forget it.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.300
He didn't mean it.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.630
You don't think Hulu is the murderer, right?

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:11.900
Even if he had a peerless knife,

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.350
he couldn't kill Song Jingye.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.350
Your dagger is not peerless.

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.540
That's why you just gave it away?

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.540
Just give me a casual apology,

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.060
and I'll forgive you.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:31.870
Wait.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:34.390
What's wrong?

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.540
Song Jingye died mysteriously.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:38.150
Am I missing something?

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:39.980
Think about it.

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.060
What am I missing?

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.300
Have you been thinking about this?

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:47.060
Haven't we been talking about this all the time?

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:49.590
I need to investigate further.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.350
Are you coming?

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:51.740
No.

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:53.260
Fine.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.710
What's the fuss?

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:55.950
Fu Sheng.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.500
From now on,

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.350
we'll go

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:00.740
our separate ways.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.590
I'm going back to Shangyi.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.980
Before I leave,

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.300
I have to earn some money.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.740
It's weird.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.940
There was a monkey.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.460
The monkey came out of the painting.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.840
