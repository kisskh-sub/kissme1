00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.380
Hello, Vice President Qian.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.508
I'm Zhang Jian Bin
a reporter from the weekly magazine.

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.926
I recently heard a rumor.

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:11.636
Someone posted online that

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:13.638
Hongfa's new chairperson, Zhou Xiao Qi,

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:16.099
murdered former chairperson
Zhan Qian Ren for his money.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.268
How could there be such a rumor? Who leaked it?

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.811
It was an anonymous tip online.

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.730
We're still investigating
the informant's true identity.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.357
And you believe such a rumor?

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:28.194
Actually, I interviewed Mr. Zhan
on the day of his accident.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.697
He looked fine and healthy.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.323
He even lifted dumbbells for me.

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.658
But not long after I left,

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:35.994
he suddenly died of a heart attack.

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:38.045
I was very surprised.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.632
What are you trying to say?

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.544
Actually, when he had his attack,

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.047
I went back to Mr. Zhan's house
to get something.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.966
But the madam didn't say much.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.011
Plus, with the online rumors and comments,

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:56.765
I'm starting to think that
something's strange about this.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:00.192
I want to hear what
Hongfa's executives think about this.

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:05.281
You know, we aren't in a position to say much.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.070
I think you should stop asking.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.948
Understood. Sir, this is my business card.

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:16.201
If you suddenly have something you wish to say,

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.994
contact me anytime.

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:20.091
- Sorry to bother you.
- Okay.

00:02:02.737 --> 00:02:06.503
[Episode 8: Did I choose the devil?]

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.085
Wait.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:48.550
Just a little longer.

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.713
I can't.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:54.549
You don't have to work now,
so you can sleep in.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.725
I can't.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.764
Why do you make it sound like I'm useless?

00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:04.942
I have a meeting with an investor today
to discuss investments.

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:07.778
I'll go to work with you later.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.775
Then give me a ride.

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:15.030
My car is in the shop.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.781
I'll take the bus to work with you today.

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:21.663
Let's experience the joy of riding the bus.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:28.791
You wouldn't like taking the bus.

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:32.503
It's crowded and uncomfortable.

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:36.390
You can just sleep tight.

00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:41.929
All right.

00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:45.190
Let's get to work.

00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:51.522
I just like squeezing in with you.

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:53.942
Squeezing in?

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.452
I'm going to be late!

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:04.168
I'll be quick.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.914
No man says he's quick!

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.174
I'll time it perfectly.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.304
All right.

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:35.407
It's kind of romantic.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:40.579
Let's see if you still think
it's romantic if you ride it daily.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.876
I'll be fine if you're with me.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:01.767
Mr. Zhan just got married
and died of a heart attack.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:05.930
This woman inherited the company
and so much inheritance.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.224
She's hella lucky.

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:10.601
His wife is so sexy and pretty.

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:13.028
Mr. Zhan's the lucky one.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.615
Maybe he died of happiness.

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:20.278
Who knows?

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:23.323
Maybe she killed him.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.284
If there's so much inheritance and money,

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.745
what wouldn't someone do?

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.796
That's true.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.341
Excuse me.

00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:38.796
It's normal for employees
to gossip about their bosses.

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:41.049
But aren't you going too far?

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.117
That's what we heard.

00:05:43.117 --> 00:05:45.720
How could the chairwoman
be that kind of person?

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:54.520
Chief Secretary.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.113
Thank you.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.795
Do you want to take my position?

00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:17.134
Now that Mr. Zhan is gone,
I think I can retire.

00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:19.312
How is that possible?

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:22.173
I'm still so inexperienced.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.384
Those aren't problems.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:28.179
Most importantly, Ms. Zhou seems to trust you.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:29.764
You know it, too.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.849
She just took office.

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.685
Many people in the company don't respect her.

00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:38.022
What she needs most now is someone on her side.

00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:41.901
You must seize this opportunity
and climb up the ladder.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.620
Do you want to be a secretary forever?

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.325
To be honest with you,

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.869
if someone else became the chairwoman,

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:54.747
you wouldn't have the chance
to be the chief secretary.

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:57.250
She happens to need you.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.676
You also need this opportunity.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.077
Hello, Hou Ze.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.914
When are you coming to pick me up?

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.409
Hello?

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:32.910
Hou Ze.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.753
Can you hear me?

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.723
I'm sorry, Mr. Li is still in a meeting.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.975
You'll have to wait a moment.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.059
It's okay.

00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:58.394
Do you need more coffee?

00:07:58.394 --> 00:08:00.195
No, thank you.

00:08:09.697 --> 00:08:11.699
Chairwoman.

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:12.909
Sorry, Yi Fu.

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:14.285
- Uncle Li.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.704
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:17.914
Uncle Li.

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:19.207
Here's the information.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:21.709
I've been working with small farmers
to develop a line of skincare products.

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:24.587
After our evaluation,
we think they have great potential.

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.380
Yi Fu, you're all grown up.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.216
You used to look like a kid.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:31.344
I can't believe you're an entrepreneur now.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.345
Not at all, Uncle Li.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.722
Look, we really put in
a lot of effort this time.

00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:36.974
The equipment for
the production line is almost ready.

00:08:36.974 --> 00:08:38.142
I'd like you to take a look.

00:08:38.142 --> 00:08:41.312
I think our products
have great business potential.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:42.647
That's good.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:45.399
It's good for young people to be motivated.

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:47.735
Considering my relationship with your mom,

00:08:47.735 --> 00:08:50.196
I have no problem investing.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.573
Chairwoman, Mr. Wang is here.

00:08:52.573 --> 00:08:54.867
I'm sorry, I have to go.

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.410
Let's talk next time.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.913
Let's ask your mom out for dinner.

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:00.540
Take a look at the proposal later.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.166
Okay.

00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:04.377
- The proposal?
- It's fine. I can get it myself.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.303
All right. I'll get going then.

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:29.409
Have you started negotiating
with the shareholders?

00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:33.114
I don't know. I'm still learning the ropes.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.494
I can't believe

00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:41.088
he had another trick
up his sleeve in his will.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.917
Actually, my salary
as chairwoman is quite high.

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:47.803
In a few years, we can live our own lives.

00:09:50.464 --> 00:09:52.925
Should I close the clinic?

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.684
You and I...

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:58.313
Sure, you can be the stay-at-home dad.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.693
Is the report out?

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:08.441
I've been busy with the funeral.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.610
I didn't have time for a check-up.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.695
I don't know.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:13.988
I'm just worried.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:16.824
Will Director Wu give you
a hard time if he finds out?

00:10:16.824 --> 00:10:18.534
Probably not.

00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:21.086
Don't worry, he doesn't have that much time.

00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:25.064
This chicken soup is good.

00:10:25.064 --> 00:10:27.168
Where did you get it?

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:31.179
I saw a five-star review
on my phone and ordered it.

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:48.071
I'm home.

00:10:49.023 --> 00:10:51.984
Why are you so late? Didn't we agree
to have dinner together?

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:54.536
I ate at the office today.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.708
I'm so tired.

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.203
The new chairman is here.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.796
There's so much to do.

00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:07.833
What about you?

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.669
How did it go with the investors today?

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.636
Are they going to invest?

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.966
All they talk about is my mom.

00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:17.677
I wanted to prove myself
without my mom's influence.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.595
But it's still the same.

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:22.223
You got all your connections from your mom.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:25.976
This is what happens
when you ask them to invest.

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:27.061
But it's really pathetic.

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.605
My only value is being Qian Li Hua's son.

00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:32.149
I'm so annoyed, too.

00:11:32.149 --> 00:11:33.842
Chief Secretary Zhao told me she's retiring

00:11:33.842 --> 00:11:35.403
and asked if I wanted to take over.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.370
Do you think I should?

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:44.422
In conclusion, all of our plans today

00:11:44.422 --> 00:11:46.622
are to effectively boost
the company's brand image.

00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:47.832
Most importantly,

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.417
we hope to use the popularity
of the flagship store

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:52.670
to promote other operations.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.714
That's all for my report today.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.556
Thank you for your guidance.

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.594
He pushed the company's bottlenecks
onto the brand image.

00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:02.763
He even hopes that
once the flagship outlet opens,

00:12:02.763 --> 00:12:04.932
the problem will naturally be solved.

00:12:04.932 --> 00:12:08.102
I think this idea is too wishful.

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:13.983
I'd like to ask, what do you mean by "wishful"?

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:18.112
Consumers' impression of Hongfa brands
is simply good and cheap.

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:19.947
It's cheap, plentiful, and easy to use.

00:12:19.947 --> 00:12:22.199
Now we're running
a flagship outlet like this.

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:24.076
Consumers might not accept it
if the cost is high.

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:26.746
The profit may not be better
than the original outlet.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.038
What a load of crap.

00:12:28.038 --> 00:12:30.332
Do you know that if the company
maintains its original model without change,

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:31.627
we'll all sink together?

00:12:31.627 --> 00:12:34.461
I think it's too impatient to rush things.

00:12:34.461 --> 00:12:35.505
We'll sink faster.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.631
- What do you mean?
- That's enough.

00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:39.531
Stop arguing.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.847
Chairman, what do you think
about the proposal for the flagship store?

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:47.232
What do you think is best?

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:58.493
I'll gather the experts' opinions
and discuss it later.

00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:10.247
Damn it, that Abla.

00:13:10.247 --> 00:13:12.291
He's just a roughneck who used to be a driver.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:15.503
He doesn't know anything,
but he's such a suck-up to Zhou Xiao Qi.

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:19.173
If it weren't for all of our support,

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:21.050
Zhou Xiao Qi wouldn't be the chairman.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.886
Look, you, me, Director You, and Director Lin.

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.972
Our combined shares won't lose to hers.

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:30.851
If it weren't for our support,
what right would she have to be chairman?

00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:32.978
Mr. Zhan asked her to take over.

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:36.023
That was agreed upon
by the interim board of directors.

00:13:36.023 --> 00:13:38.567
Why do you have to make things so unpleasant?

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:39.777
That's not the point, Mr. Huang.

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:42.988
This isn't about making a scene anymore.

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:44.240
Think about it.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.617
If my sister were the chairman,

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:50.830
wouldn't the company be
better off under her leadership?

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.249
Ms. Qian as the chairman?

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:58.170
Is this your idea or hers?

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.047
Neither.

00:14:00.047 --> 00:14:02.216
You know my sister's personality.

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:03.717
She's ambitious and capable.

00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:07.054
But she's just a little conservative.

00:14:07.054 --> 00:14:10.649
As her brother, I have to step up and help her.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.185
How about this?

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:17.898
I don't think Zhou Xiao Qi
has any ambition to run the company.

00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:21.652
As for me, I'll treat everyone to a meal.

00:14:21.652 --> 00:14:23.571
Maybe after we talk to her,

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:26.115
she'll be willing to step down.

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:29.584
That way, things won't get so ugly.

00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:37.877
What do you think about
what Director You and Vice President Qian said?

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.713
Vice President Qian's proposed repositioning
requires too much money.

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.965
But the income source
is completely unpredictable.

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:45.199
So, I agree with Director You.

00:14:47.177 --> 00:14:48.512
But Vice President Qian just said

00:14:48.512 --> 00:14:51.682
if we stick to the original model, we'll sink.

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:53.441
What should we do then?

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.937
Actually, with our current business model,

00:14:56.937 --> 00:14:59.982
there's a lot of room to increase sales.

00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:02.192
For a store of about 300 ping,

00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:05.154
our competitors average
seven to eight million a month.

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:06.857
But we only make five million.

00:15:06.857 --> 00:15:08.616
That's a terrible sales per square meter.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.333
It's that big of a difference?

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:23.631
So, our priority now is to increase
the sales per square meter, right?

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:24.840
How do we do that?

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.259
For example, we can improve logistics.

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:30.804
We can reduce the size of the warehouse
and increase the sales area.

00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:33.140
The headquarters can also
reduce restrictions on store managers,

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.935
give them more autonomy,
and increase the incentive percentage.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.326
We can also amend the personnel regulations

00:15:37.326 --> 00:15:40.280
and promote store managers
with good performance.

00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:45.611
Chief Secretary Zhao said she wants to retire.

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.655
She recommended you as the chief secretary.

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:49.531
Do you want to take up the job?

00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:51.283
She said you haven't thought it through.

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:53.668
- Can you reconsider?
- Okay.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.298
Okay.

00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:35.076
Peter, long time no see.

00:16:35.076 --> 00:16:36.078

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:37.413
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:38.956
Nice, sit down.

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:40.499
- Dora. Wendy.
- Hello.

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:43.252
- Hello.
- Let's have a toast.

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:45.379
Allen, how can we talk with all this noise?

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:48.340
You don't know that
all business deals are done at clubs?

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.718
With wine and women,
there's nothing we can't agree on.

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:52.894
Yes, that's right.

00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:54.722
Allen, Peter.

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.515
You know, the investment proposal
I told you about over the phone?

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:58.608
I brought the proposal.

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:01.311
I'm working with small farmers this time.

00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:02.855
We're developing a skincare product.

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.648
We want to incorporate it with coffee.

00:17:04.648 --> 00:17:06.984
It's a fusion concept store.

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:08.402
You have a lot of ideas now.

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:09.695
Fusion?

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.905
I heard something about
small farmers and coffee.

00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:14.283
What is it? Do you love the earth?
Are you an environmentalist?

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:16.751
Environmentalist?

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.998
I still need some funds.

00:17:20.998 --> 00:17:22.750
About 20 million.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.586
Is it 20 million each
or 20 million combined?

00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:27.296
We're such good friends.

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:28.888
Let's make it 10 million each.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.100
Let me ask her.

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:37.222
She said it's okay.

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.557
- Okay?
- She said it's okay.

00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:40.684
If you said it's okay, let me ask my dad.

00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:42.061
Hello, Dad.

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:44.688
Xin Yi Fu wants us to invest
10 million in him, is that okay?

00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:45.939
Yes.

00:17:45.939 --> 00:17:48.400
- Is it okay? I'll check for you.
- Talk to my dad.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.778
Hello, Uncle! Is it okay?

00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:52.362
- Yes.
- Hang on.

- It's okay.
- Hey!

00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:57.959
Allen, I'm serious this time.
I won't let you lose money.

00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:02.956
It's really okay. I'm just kidding.

00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:03.957
- 10 million.
- It's okay.

00:18:03.957 --> 00:18:05.626
- You said it.
- It's true.

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:06.835
You're truly my good brother.

00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:07.961
Thanks. I'll drink to you.

227,578. Cash or credit card?

I don't have to rely on my mom anymore.

Did you go to a club just now?

00:19:55.485 --> 00:19:57.495
How much did you spend?

00:19:58.197 --> 00:19:59.865
Over 200,000.

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.575
Over 200,000?

00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:04.460
You're spending so much money
before you've made any.

00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:07.331
It's only 200,000.

00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:10.459
Compared to... my friends...

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:14.004
Compared to the 20 million and more
they invested in me...

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:16.048
200,000?

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.549
It's chump change.

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.384
Chump change?

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:22.554
You're different now.
Can you stop wasting money?

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:25.557
No, Miss.

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:29.193
Miss, I'm starting a business.

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:39.622
I'm not done yet.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.299
Do you look down on me like everyone else?

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:57.930
Do you think I can't live without my mom?

00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:00.808
Do you want to go home?

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:06.355
The more you think that way,

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:10.026

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:56.489
Okay.

00:26:56.489 --> 00:26:57.782
Do you want something to drink?

00:26:57.782 --> 00:26:58.992
No, thanks.

00:26:58.992 --> 00:27:01.127
- You go ahead.
- Okay.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.629
The number you have dialed...

00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:12.138
Fuck!

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.896
Hey, Allen. You finally picked up.

00:27:27.896 --> 00:27:30.690
You said you'd invest in me.
When are we signing the contract?

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.360
My parents heard this was
your own business venture,

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.527
and they're not very supportive.

00:27:34.527 --> 00:27:36.613
Didn't you say you'd invest
10 million in me?

00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:39.282
My parents don't agree,
so I don't have the money.

00:27:39.282 --> 00:27:40.700
I'm sorry, buddy.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.452
Peter and you are both doing the same thing!

00:27:42.452 --> 00:27:44.245
Didn't you say you'd invest in me?
Didn't you agree to it?

00:27:44.245 --> 00:27:46.797
Hey!

00:27:47.749 --> 00:27:49.100
Fuck!

00:27:54.798 --> 00:27:56.966
I already paid two million dollars
in down payment.

00:27:56.966 --> 00:27:58.301
Now the investment money is gone.

00:27:58.301 --> 00:28:00.887
I don't know if they're messing with me
or God is messing with me.

00:28:00.887 --> 00:28:02.722
It's fine.

00:28:02.722 --> 00:28:04.254
Just go home and be a vice president.

00:28:04.254 --> 00:28:05.267
Apologize to your mom, and it'll be fine.

00:28:05.267 --> 00:28:06.768
That's impossible.

00:28:06.768 --> 00:28:09.187
My mom suspended my credit card
and confiscated my car.

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.855
She just wants to force me to admit defeat.

00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:12.273
I will never give up this time.

00:28:12.273 --> 00:28:13.858
You're ambitious.

00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:15.485
It's good to be ambitious.

00:28:15.485 --> 00:28:17.870
But you can't do anything without money.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.281
That's the reality.

00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:23.417
I don't believe I can't find
another way to get money now.

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:35.304
Why are you looking at me?

00:28:45.473 --> 00:28:48.484
I have a stock tip.
Do you want to make a gamble?

00:28:49.936 --> 00:28:51.479
Is it reliable?

00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:54.023
I only put in 500,000.

00:28:54.023 --> 00:28:56.617
Who has money to invest in stocks now?

00:28:59.028 --> 00:29:03.950
Didn't you say talk about Kevin
who's willing to take over this bar?

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.377
Kevin from the movie? Kevin?

00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:10.673
Are you sure you want to go that far?

00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:14.301
Don't mess around.

00:29:19.632 --> 00:29:21.217
Gu Hou Ze.

00:29:21.217 --> 00:29:25.597
Ms. Fan is accusing you and this widow
of murdering for money.

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:27.265
This is a serious accusation.

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:29.817
I need to hear your side of the story.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:38.067
This lady and I have a normal
doctor-patient relationship.

00:29:38.067 --> 00:29:40.153
It's all Ms. Fan's delusion.

00:29:40.153 --> 00:29:42.238
How can it be my delusion?

00:29:42.238 --> 00:29:44.491
It's all over the weekly magazine.

00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:46.875
Isn't that what everyone thinks?

00:29:47.994 --> 00:29:49.078
Director.

00:29:49.078 --> 00:29:50.163
To boost sales,

00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:53.458
the magazine combines rumors
and gossip without any evidence.

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:56.753
Coincidentally, it also guided
Ms. Fan's imagination

00:29:56.753 --> 00:29:59.339
to rationalize her delusions.

00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:01.299
You have the guts to claim...

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:05.595
you don't have
an abnormal relationship with her?

00:30:05.595 --> 00:30:07.764
You don't dare?

00:30:07.764 --> 00:30:09.440
But I do.

00:30:13.728 --> 00:30:17.023
Director, I'm sending you a file now.

00:30:17.023 --> 00:30:18.741
Take a look.

00:30:23.738 --> 00:30:26.790
Do you remember that night at the cabin?

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:29.953
You tried to kill me.

00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:32.831
When I wasn't looking, you drugged my wine.

00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:35.208
You wanted to kill me when I was unconscious.

00:30:35.208 --> 00:30:37.051
And then commit suicide together.

00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:41.422
Director, don't listen to him.

00:30:41.422 --> 00:30:44.259
Why are you bringing this up
to complicate things?

00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:47.720
Director, this video
is just a normal lovers' quarrel.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.056
- Does this normal to you?
- It's nothing. Don't watch it.

00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:52.016
I don't think this is
a normal couple's quarrel.

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:54.185
Gu Hou Ze, how could you do this?

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:56.271
Ms. Fan, if you're willing to
face your illness...

00:30:56.271 --> 00:30:59.232
- Just admit your relationship with her.
- It'll be more helpful for you.

00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:01.317
- It'll be easier for us to help you.
- Why are you talking nonsense?

00:31:01.317 --> 00:31:02.944
- Calm down first.
- I'm not agitated.

00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:04.904
I'm telling the truth. I'm not lying.

00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:06.948
If you don't love me, just say it.

00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:08.241
- Ms. Fan.
- If you don't love me!

00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:09.450
- Ms. Fan.
- You can say it!

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:10.451
- Ms. Fan.
- I can die.

00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:12.120
- Ms. Fan.
- Gu Hou Ze, say it please.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.247
- Ms. Fan. Nurse!
- Say it.

00:31:14.247 --> 00:31:15.290
The patient is out of control.

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.001
You can't say things like that.

00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:19.919
Gu Hou Ze!

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:22.088
Gu Hou Ze!

00:31:22.088 --> 00:31:24.090
Gu Hou Ze!

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.217
Gu Hou Ze!

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:28.477
You're lying!

00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:42.491
Chairwoman, I don't know
if you've read this article.

00:31:43.526 --> 00:31:44.652
Of course.

00:31:44.652 --> 00:31:47.488
We know these are just groundless rumors.

00:31:47.488 --> 00:31:49.699
They're completely baseless.

00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:52.285
But you know, you just took over.

00:31:52.285 --> 00:31:55.455
I don't think it looks good for the company

00:31:55.455 --> 00:31:57.665
or for you personally.

00:31:57.665 --> 00:32:00.710
You know it's just gossip and rumors.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.053
It's not true, so I need to explain anything?

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.427
After Mr. Zhan passed away,

00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:12.972
the company's morale is unstable.

00:32:12.972 --> 00:32:17.769
And you don't have the expertise
to run a company.

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:22.398
Now the company is full of rumors and distrust.

00:32:22.398 --> 00:32:24.025
We're thinking...

00:32:24.025 --> 00:32:27.904
If you're not interested
in managing the company,

00:32:27.904 --> 00:32:30.198
wouldn't taking on this position

00:32:30.198 --> 00:32:32.583
put a lot of pressure on you?

00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:35.286
Mr. Huang, you don't know me well.

00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:37.997
I don't do things I'm not interested in.

00:32:37.997 --> 00:32:39.958
Besides, this is Mr. Zhan's last wish.

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:43.127
I'll do my best to make it a success.

00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:47.090
Wanting to do a good job
and being able to are two different things.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.684
We asked you here today to give you a way out.

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:54.430
Although you're Hongfa's largest shareholder,

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.809
you only have a little over 30 percent.

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:01.771
I hope you won't force us
to go head-to-head with you.

00:33:01.771 --> 00:33:05.775
For the sake of everyone's peace
and the company's future,

00:33:05.775 --> 00:33:08.778
Zhou Xiao Qi, we earnestly hope

00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:11.830
you'll voluntarily resign as chairperson.

00:33:28.256 --> 00:33:30.591
Excuse me, I'd like to ask something.

00:33:30.591 --> 00:33:34.512
Didn't everyone agree on the appointment
at the emergency board meeting?

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:37.314
- Why the sudden...
- You have no right to speak.

00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:47.908
That's impossible.

00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:51.821
I won't resign.

00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:53.740
How do I know someone
didn't maliciously slander me

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.874
and spread these rumors and gossip?

00:33:56.951 --> 00:34:00.121
If I resign, does that mean I'm admitting it?

00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:02.089
Is that good for the company?

00:34:05.626 --> 00:34:07.219
I don't think so.

00:34:09.964 --> 00:34:12.057
Of course, you don't have to resign.

00:34:12.675 --> 00:34:15.178
But you have to think this through.

00:34:15.178 --> 00:34:19.057
If we shareholders unite,
our shares won't be less than yours.

00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:22.935
If we really go head-to-head, we'll all suffer.

00:34:22.935 --> 00:34:25.279
The result will still be the same.

00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:30.109
Actually, we also hope

00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:34.998
you can rest well during your pregnancy.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.375
We're all doing this for Hongfa.

00:34:40.703 --> 00:34:43.922
Let's serve the food and talk while we eat.

00:34:44.665 --> 00:34:47.043
Enjoy your meal.

00:34:47.043 --> 00:34:49.428
The pregnant woman needs to go rest.

00:35:02.975 --> 00:35:05.110
What a show-off.

00:35:22.662 --> 00:35:25.039
It's the chairperson's special brew.

00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:27.333
It's not good for you to drink.

00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:30.010
I'm drinking water. The alcohol is for you.

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:33.889
Cheers.

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:41.730
You've got some nerve.

00:35:43.057 --> 00:35:44.691
I meant just now.

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:47.478
I just said what I had to say.

00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:48.932
The three of them were ganging up on you.

00:35:48.932 --> 00:35:51.232
I couldn't just watch.

00:35:51.232 --> 00:35:53.109
Aren't you afraid of choosing the wrong side?

00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:54.694
What do you mean?

00:35:54.694 --> 00:35:57.287
I'm your chief secretary.
I have to support you.

00:35:58.072 --> 00:36:01.492
I might not be able to keep my position or you.

00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:03.995
You might get fired in a few months.

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:06.254
Are you so sure about siding with me?

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:09.049
I'm not sure.

00:36:11.961 --> 00:36:13.671
What do you mean?

00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:15.882
Don't say you're helping me out.

00:36:15.882 --> 00:36:17.592
We're not that close.

00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:19.427
That would be too pretentious.

00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:22.604
You probably wouldn't
want to hear it if I said that.

00:36:29.103 --> 00:36:30.988
To be honest...

00:36:32.398 --> 00:36:34.442
I want to take a chance.

00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:37.195
My opponents don't like me,
and I don't like them either.

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:39.113
So, I don't stand a chance there.

00:36:39.113 --> 00:36:41.157
I might as well bet on you.

00:36:41.157 --> 00:36:43.576
Although the chances are low,

00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:45.877
I might still have a chance
to climb up the ladder.

00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:49.339
Thank you for your honesty.

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:55.213
I hope we can raise the probability together.

00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:57.632
It's always best to do it for yourself, right?

00:36:57.632 --> 00:36:59.508
Let's work hard together.

00:36:59.508 --> 00:37:01.101
And fight.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.315
It's burnt.

00:37:16.025 --> 00:37:18.110
Welcome.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.655
- Yi Fu, why are you here?
- Kevin.

00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:23.248
Can't I come back to visit
after selling the bar?

00:37:24.158 --> 00:37:26.001
How's it going?

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:31.791
This place is still run
according to your model.

00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:36.462
It seems like the new owner
doesn't make much difference

00:37:36.462 --> 00:37:38.130
to the regulars.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.383
People here just want a place to drink.

00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:43.177
You should come back more often.

00:37:43.177 --> 00:37:45.137
You want me to sit for you?

00:37:45.137 --> 00:37:47.223
I charge a lot.

00:37:47.223 --> 00:37:50.810
Where's the after-sales service?

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.603
So, you know how to come back.

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:54.021
- I'll leave you to it.
- You go ahead.

00:37:54.021 --> 00:37:55.238
Okay.

00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:00.278
Tony.

00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:01.904
How's the new boss?

00:38:01.904 --> 00:38:02.987
He's awesome.

00:38:02.987 --> 00:38:04.657
He even gave me a raise after you left.

00:38:04.657 --> 00:38:06.701
He even cares if we're hungry or cold.

00:38:06.701 --> 00:38:08.335
Awesome.

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:16.502
I really didn't expect you to go that far.

00:38:16.502 --> 00:38:18.553
You sold the entire place.

00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:22.258
Of course I'm reluctant.

00:38:22.258 --> 00:38:24.677
But I want to work hard for once.

00:38:24.677 --> 00:38:26.812
I can't be held back by money.

00:38:31.183 --> 00:38:33.902
You'd better make sure
your insider tip is clean.

00:38:58.127 --> 00:38:59.928
You're still working so late.

00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:03.549
I haven't finished my work.

00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:06.635
Your company is exploiting
its employees too much.

00:39:06.635 --> 00:39:08.512
It's me who wants to do it.

00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:11.106
Xiao Qi really needs me now.

00:39:13.893 --> 00:39:15.561
Xiao Qi...

00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:17.772
You have dinner with Xiao Qi every night.

00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:19.739
When will it be my turn?

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.528
I'm sorry.

00:39:24.528 --> 00:39:25.529
How about this?

00:39:25.529 --> 00:39:26.718
It's your birthday on Friday.

00:39:26.718 --> 00:39:29.492
I'll cook a delicious meal for you.

00:39:29.492 --> 00:39:31.000
Okay?

00:39:35.331 --> 00:39:37.041
You have to keep your word.

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.793
Don't bail on me.

00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:42.004
I wouldn't dare bail on your birthday.

00:39:42.004 --> 00:39:45.091
We can go to the bar after dinner.

00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:47.593
Sunset Sea is performing that Friday.

00:39:47.593 --> 00:39:49.895
I haven't heard them sing in a long time.

00:39:53.474 --> 00:39:55.518
I sold the bar.

00:39:55.518 --> 00:39:59.355
The new owner didn't like Sunset Sea that much,
so they don't perform there.

00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:01.857
When did you sell the bar?

00:40:01.857 --> 00:40:03.943
Why are you so serious?

00:40:03.943 --> 00:40:06.487
Anyway, I couldn't find the money at that time.

00:40:06.487 --> 00:40:08.155
Tony had an insider tip. I thought...

00:40:08.155 --> 00:40:09.448
An insider tip?

00:40:09.448 --> 00:40:10.825
What if the insider tip is wrong?

00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:12.993
You'd lose the whole bar.

00:40:12.993 --> 00:40:14.870
Why are you looking down on me?

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.288
Do you think I won't succeed?

00:40:16.288 --> 00:40:17.748
No.

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:20.084
You spent over 200,000 at the club.

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:23.337
You said your friend would invest
20 million dollars, but what happened?

00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:26.340
- Why are you so impulsive?
- My mom is like this, and so are you.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.135
Every time I try to be serious about something,
you all rain on my parade.

00:40:29.135 --> 00:40:31.137
Would it kill you to support me?

00:40:31.137 --> 00:40:33.521
Why are you exaggerating?

00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:52.457
Of course I support you.

00:40:53.325 --> 00:40:56.370
It's just that that bar means a lot to us.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:58.789
I don't want you to sell it.

00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:00.583
Do you really care about that bar?

00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:02.501
To you, it's all about work.

00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:04.378
When was the last time you went to that bar?

00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:07.639
I even helped you talk to Tony
about your resignation.

00:41:08.507 --> 00:41:11.343
How long has it been
since we sat here and talked, Miss?

00:41:11.343 --> 00:41:14.437
You don't even care about me,
but you care about that bar?

00:41:15.055 --> 00:41:16.690
What a joke.

00:41:29.695 --> 00:41:32.080
Thank you. Come again.

00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:34.624
Here.

00:41:35.534 --> 00:41:37.661
Bye.

00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:38.787
Here.

00:41:38.787 --> 00:41:40.539
- Your drunken chicken.
- Okay, thank you.

00:41:40.539 --> 00:41:42.374
Boss, do you have beer?

00:41:42.374 --> 00:41:44.752
No beer. If you want to drink, go to a bar.

00:41:44.752 --> 00:41:47.171
This is a soup shop. We sell noodles here.

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:50.557
- I see a can over there.
- That's mine.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.178
Chairman, have a seat.

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:56.388
Does it upset you if you don't
scold people for a day?

00:41:56.388 --> 00:41:57.598
They're willing to be scolded by me.

00:41:57.598 --> 00:41:58.655
I'm used to scolding them.

00:41:58.655 --> 00:42:00.809
I don't feel good if I don't.

00:42:00.809 --> 00:42:02.394
Haven't you eaten?

00:42:02.394 --> 00:42:04.021
I have.

00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:06.106
Here, have some meat to nourish yourself.

00:42:06.106 --> 00:42:09.360
Your face is sunken in.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:13.280
They say a sunken face makes a woman look old.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.573
It's fine if you look old.

00:42:14.573 --> 00:42:17.493
But don't starve yourself
and suffer from malnutrition.

00:42:17.493 --> 00:42:19.745
Okay, stop nagging.

00:42:19.745 --> 00:42:22.414
How is it? Are you adjusting well?

00:42:22.414 --> 00:42:24.549
Of course. Who do you think I am?

00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:27.469
Who are you?

00:42:28.754 --> 00:42:31.215
Don't put on a strong front before me.

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:32.849
I...

00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:37.179
I started when you couldn't
even afford a bowl of noodles.

00:42:37.179 --> 00:42:39.932
And I've worked my way up
until you became the chairman.

00:42:39.932 --> 00:42:41.308
Who am I?

00:42:41.308 --> 00:42:43.894
You seem to be very successful.

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:46.897
Why don't I feel happy for you at all?

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:48.899
Why are you unhappy?

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:51.402
You used to be with the chairman.

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:52.570
Right?

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:53.612
Freedom.

00:42:53.612 --> 00:42:54.738
Relaxation.

00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:56.323
And money.

00:42:56.323 --> 00:42:58.325
You're the chairman now.

00:42:58.325 --> 00:43:02.079
You see all that scheming on TV, right?

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:04.707
You can't beat them with your personality.

00:43:04.707 --> 00:43:06.792
I have to learn. What else can I do?

00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:09.378
Why learn this? Learn what you like.

00:43:09.378 --> 00:43:10.754
Are you happy?

00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:12.840
Are you selling chicken soup for the soul now?

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.300
No.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.052
You're going to face those villains.

00:43:17.052 --> 00:43:18.387
And you...

00:43:18.387 --> 00:43:21.849
And you're going to lie
to Dr. Gu that the baby is his.

00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:25.394
If I were you, I would explode for you to see.

00:43:25.394 --> 00:43:28.822
What else can I do? I have no choice.

00:43:29.565 --> 00:43:31.775
Anyway, I'm running this company for my child.

00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:33.785
I want to give him the best.

00:43:35.029 --> 00:43:36.697
What about Dr. Gu?

00:43:36.697 --> 00:43:39.908
Are you going to lie to him forever?

00:43:39.908 --> 00:43:41.869
That's the only thing I can do.

00:43:41.869 --> 00:43:42.995
Miss.

00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:44.288
Secrets like this...

00:43:44.288 --> 00:43:48.667
If you keep it a secret,
it's a matter of character and luck.

00:43:48.667 --> 00:43:50.544
You're in danger.

00:43:50.544 --> 00:43:53.839
So, I hope luck will be on my side this time.

00:43:53.839 --> 00:43:56.050
No matter who the father is,

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:58.435
he's still my child.

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:04.642
Madam, fish soup!

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:06.818
Right, soup.

00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:25.788
Miss Fan, do you want to eat?

00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:27.915
Why do I have to eat?

00:44:27.915 --> 00:44:29.458
It's been two days.

00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:32.795
You can't go without food or drink.

00:44:32.795 --> 00:44:35.096
You're a new intern.

00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:38.967
I'll die if I don't eat, right?

00:44:38.967 --> 00:44:41.603
You're afraid you'll be
in trouble if I die, aren't you?

00:44:42.304 --> 00:44:44.056
Why don't you feed me then?

00:44:44.056 --> 00:44:46.357
Feed me and I'll eat.

00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:56.026
Here.

00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:57.569
I'm not eating.

00:44:57.569 --> 00:44:58.904
Why should I eat?

00:44:58.904 --> 00:45:00.322
Are you kidding me?

00:45:00.322 --> 00:45:03.033
How can I eat this disgusting food?

00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:04.660
Fine.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.870
Stop pretending to care about me.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.497
I'll get you a new one.

00:45:08.497 --> 00:45:12.000
If you really want to be
good to me, just let me out.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.671
- Can't you do that?
- Fine, you can do it tomorrow.

00:45:15.671 --> 00:45:17.506
I just want plain rice.

00:45:17.506 --> 00:45:19.098
Okay.

00:45:30.602 --> 00:45:33.488
Didn't you say the price would go up?
Why did it drop so much?

00:45:36.108 --> 00:45:37.985
I'm sorry.

00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:39.222
I did make a profit when I followed along,

00:45:39.222 --> 00:45:41.162
but I didn't expect...

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:43.611
I put all my money in.

00:45:43.611 --> 00:45:44.700
What do I do now?

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.034
I'm on the same boat!

00:45:46.034 --> 00:45:47.119
If you lose, I lose, too.

00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:48.537
How much is your "all in," damn it?

00:45:48.537 --> 00:45:50.748
Hundreds of thousands? I bet millions!

00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:53.083
Didn't I warn you not to bet so much?

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:55.085
You can't just blame me and not yourself.

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:57.720
- Damn you!
- What?

00:46:05.137 --> 00:46:06.513
I'm stupid, I'm worthless.

00:46:06.513 --> 00:46:07.789
My start-up fund is gone, my shop is gone.

00:46:07.789 --> 00:46:09.857
I have nothing left!

00:46:27.242 --> 00:46:28.591
Let's go.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:59.115
She never puts the key back after using it.

00:47:02.194 --> 00:47:05.113
Jeffrey, long time no see.

00:47:05.113 --> 00:47:06.532
How have you been lately?

00:47:06.532 --> 00:47:09.409
I was wondering...

00:47:09.409 --> 00:47:13.398
Do you have any extra money
that you can lend me?

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:17.167
It's okay. Thank you.

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:18.760
I really don't need it.

00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:24.182
Okay, see you next time.

00:47:35.143 --> 00:47:37.554
[Happy birthday. I got you a present.]
[Pick it up when you get a chance.]

00:47:54.496 --> 00:47:56.456
Your turn.

00:47:56.456 --> 00:47:59.008
Why am I so unlucky?

00:48:00.168 --> 00:48:03.755
Happy birthday to you.

00:48:03.755 --> 00:48:06.967
Happy birthday to you.

00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:10.429
Happy birthday to you.

00:48:10.429 --> 00:48:12.472
Happy birthday to you.

00:48:12.472 --> 00:48:14.349
Okay.

00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:15.684
Happy birthday.

00:48:15.684 --> 00:48:18.604
Make a wish, make a wish.

00:48:18.604 --> 00:48:20.188
I don't have anything to wish for.

00:48:20.188 --> 00:48:22.107
- Hurry up.
- Make a wish.

00:48:22.107 --> 00:48:23.817
Okay, I'll make a wish then.

00:48:23.817 --> 00:48:25.277
Tony, stay single for life!

00:48:25.277 --> 00:48:26.577
Damn it!
