00:12.625 --> 00:14.875
"Made of earth and stone."

00:17.083 --> 00:18.916
"A snow-clad heart

00:20.125 --> 00:21.791
and icy bones."

00:24.666 --> 00:27.500
From the depths of the mountains,
the trolls rose.

00:31.500 --> 00:35.791
For a long time,
humans and trolls lived side by side

00:36.333 --> 00:39.125
in peaceful and respectful harmony.

00:40.416 --> 00:43.000
Until a new world order

00:43.083 --> 00:45.250
swept across Europe.

00:45.875 --> 00:49.375
In Norway, a young king was tasked
with Christianizing the country.

00:50.208 --> 00:53.083
Saint Olaf.

00:53.833 --> 00:57.958
The new faith had no room
for the ancients of the Earth.

00:58.541 --> 01:01.541
From the safe darkness
of the woods and mountains,

01:01.625 --> 01:04.000
he drove them out into the sunlight,

01:04.083 --> 01:06.666
where they turned to stone.

01:07.666 --> 01:10.000
With sword and Bible in hand,

01:10.083 --> 01:12.583
Olaf cleansed the country of trolls.

01:13.708 --> 01:16.000
And as the massacre raged on,

01:16.666 --> 01:21.250
the trolls grew wary
of the sacred symbols of Christianity.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.416
The age of trolls

01:24.333 --> 01:25.166
was over.

01:26.583 --> 01:32.166
He showed no mercy
and slaughtered them all, adults and…

01:32.250 --> 01:34.708
I think we'll stop there, guys.

01:35.208 --> 01:38.500
But, Mom, Dad's telling me
about the troll messicker.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.208
Massacre.

01:40.291 --> 01:41.666
But, Dad,

01:41.750 --> 01:44.416
why was Saint Olaf so mean?

01:44.500 --> 01:46.916
-The trolls were there first!
-Exactly.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.291
Why didn't anyone help them?
That's what I'd have done.

01:50.375 --> 01:54.625
Good! But there was no one to protect them
from the narrow-mindedness of men.

01:54.708 --> 01:59.833
Okay, you better leave before I toss you
out on your butt, Tidemann.

02:00.625 --> 02:02.208
To be continued.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.833
-Good night, Tiny.
-Good night, Big.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.791
"Troll massacre"?

02:10.875 --> 02:13.583
Is Ashlad's eating match
with the troll better?

02:13.666 --> 02:16.416
The troll gutting itself,
and its entrails spilling out?

02:19.458 --> 02:20.791
Hey, are you okay?

02:22.166 --> 02:23.250
Are you okay?

02:24.458 --> 02:26.791
Relax. I'm fine.

02:26.875 --> 02:27.916
Are you sure?

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Promise.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.625
Hey, Mom?

02:31.791 --> 02:34.833
You know the fairy tale
about the troll wedding?

02:34.916 --> 02:38.083
Do you think they were actually
chased up there by the mean Olaf?

02:38.166 --> 02:39.791
And that's why they died?

02:43.166 --> 02:46.458
Yeah. Well, it's a possibility.

02:47.583 --> 02:48.583
Yeah.

02:49.916 --> 02:50.916
Out.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.625
We'll take you there someday, Nora.

02:55.708 --> 02:57.500
To the Troll Wall.

02:57.583 --> 02:58.833
You promise?

03:00.166 --> 03:01.166
Promise.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.250
Go to sleep now.

03:03.916 --> 03:05.000
I'm not sleepy.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.416
Can you sing?

03:07.791 --> 03:08.625
Please.

03:10.666 --> 03:14.291
When Mama Troll has put

03:14.375 --> 03:18.541
Her 11 little trolls to bed

03:19.333 --> 03:26.125
And tied them up by their tails

03:27.000 --> 03:31.125
She sings a slow song

03:32.250 --> 03:36.041
For her 11 little trolls

03:37.083 --> 03:44.083
The most beautiful words that she knows

04:06.916 --> 04:09.750
30 YEARS LATER

05:13.916 --> 05:15.166
Hello?

05:16.625 --> 05:17.875
No!

05:20.791 --> 05:23.125
Nora, wait! It's me!

05:24.208 --> 05:25.250
It's me!

05:28.791 --> 05:30.166
Andreas Isaksen.

05:36.375 --> 05:37.625
It's been a while.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.041
It's just me here.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.541
Tidemann hospitality runs in the family.

05:56.625 --> 05:57.875
Yeah, I…

05:59.250 --> 06:01.291
I wasn't expecting guests.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.166
What…

06:12.291 --> 06:13.833
What have you…

06:16.708 --> 06:18.083
been up to

06:18.583 --> 06:20.291
since last time?

06:27.416 --> 06:31.583
Hey, I don't mean to be rude or anything.

06:31.666 --> 06:36.208
It's good to see you again and all that,
but what are you doing here?

06:37.666 --> 06:38.750
I…

06:41.458 --> 06:44.583
ON THE TRAIL OF SAINT OLAF'S TOMB

06:44.666 --> 06:48.000
I was just wondering
if you could help us with something.

06:48.583 --> 06:49.833
Us?

06:50.791 --> 06:52.000
Yeah, I mean…

06:52.833 --> 06:54.416
Is it a national security thing?

06:54.500 --> 06:56.875
You can't say
and have to take me somewhere secret?

07:05.583 --> 07:09.750
-I thought you were done with that stuff.
-Yeah, I thought so too.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.958
But just when I thought I was out,

07:13.000 --> 07:14.625
they pulled me back in.

07:18.291 --> 07:19.666
A lot has changed.

07:23.958 --> 07:26.041
A new government and…

07:26.125 --> 07:30.000
PALACE DENIES ACCUSATIONS

07:30.666 --> 07:32.291
…a new prime minister with--

07:32.375 --> 07:35.958
It doesn't matter who's in power.
They're all the same.

07:36.041 --> 07:38.458
WITHDRAWS FROM TROLL COMMISSION

07:38.541 --> 07:41.583
RESTRAINING ORDER FROM THE PALACE

07:45.125 --> 07:46.958
A FISTFUL OF ZEN

07:51.875 --> 07:54.041
I'm sorry you made the trip for nothing.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.625
You don't know what criticism is

08:01.708 --> 08:04.416
until you've been roasted
by 12-year-olds on TikTok.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.625
-I haven't…
-Don't worry about it.

08:07.708 --> 08:11.125
I saw you dedicated it to Dad.
That was really nice.

08:14.875 --> 08:16.000
He'd have liked that.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.250
I think

08:22.541 --> 08:25.125
he'd have liked
what I want to show you too.

08:26.958 --> 08:28.250
What do you mean?

08:31.375 --> 08:32.791
You've found

08:34.333 --> 08:36.041
something else?

08:43.500 --> 08:44.750
Damn.

09:03.250 --> 09:05.375
It's just a formality.

09:10.916 --> 09:14.375
You know it takes more than
a few papers to keep me quiet?

09:14.458 --> 09:15.458
Yeah.

09:16.458 --> 09:18.250
But if you tell anyone about this,

09:19.041 --> 09:22.125
people are definitely
going to think you're bonkers.

09:35.125 --> 09:36.125
Thank you.

09:37.916 --> 09:40.833
TINY TROLLY MOLLY

09:49.916 --> 09:50.916
Vemork?

09:58.541 --> 10:03.000
VEMORK POWER STATION
RJUKAN

10:15.875 --> 10:17.375
Professor Sinkhole?

10:18.583 --> 10:22.500
Yes, you probably remember
Professors Møller and Wangel.

10:22.583 --> 10:25.375
Professor Tidemann. Welcome to Vemork.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.208
This must come as a bit of a shock.

10:28.291 --> 10:30.000
You could say that.

10:30.083 --> 10:34.541
It's regrettable that we got off
on the wrong foot last time, Professor.

10:34.625 --> 10:39.166
At the time, the government didn't have
security clearance for Project Jotun,

10:39.250 --> 10:41.333
and the information we possess.

10:42.250 --> 10:45.500
But secrets have a tendency
to be exposed sooner or later.

10:45.583 --> 10:46.416
Yes.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.333
Like trolls in the sun.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.333
What are you talking about?

10:52.041 --> 10:54.333
Someone has always known.

10:56.625 --> 11:01.125
The history books tell of the Allied
sabotage operations during World War II.

11:01.208 --> 11:03.541
The Heroes of Telemark.

11:03.625 --> 11:06.541
The race to develop the first atomic bomb.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.833
The heavy water ops
to upset Hitler's plans.

11:08.916 --> 11:12.458
A cover for what the mission
was really about.

11:14.583 --> 11:18.333
The battle, Professor Tidemann,
was never about heavy water.

12:17.666 --> 12:20.041
The people who found him 100 years ago

12:20.125 --> 12:22.041
named him Jotun,

12:22.125 --> 12:24.875
after the primeval trolls from mythology.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.125
But

12:28.041 --> 12:29.500
I call him

12:29.583 --> 12:31.083
Megatroll.

12:34.375 --> 12:35.958
We've naturally taken steps

12:36.041 --> 12:38.833
to prevent any potential security threats.

12:38.916 --> 12:41.500
UV lights have been installed
around the troll.

12:42.291 --> 12:45.083
Powerful enough
to turn it to stone in an instant.

12:45.166 --> 12:47.583
Inspired by
your creative solution in Oslo.

12:50.083 --> 12:51.791
What are you guys doing?

12:52.375 --> 12:54.000
Do we have a visitor?

12:55.291 --> 12:57.250
Yes. This is Professor--

12:57.333 --> 13:00.583
Marion Auryn Rhadani.
I'm the project supervisor.

13:00.666 --> 13:03.208
-This is--
-The legendary Nora Tidemann.

13:03.291 --> 13:04.916
I'm well aware of who you are.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.375
I thought we agreed

13:07.458 --> 13:09.083
not to involve her.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.708
If we don't show any progress soon,

13:14.791 --> 13:17.208
they'll shut down the whole project.

13:17.291 --> 13:19.291
What's going on?

13:19.958 --> 13:22.041
My apologies. It's Farsi.

13:22.125 --> 13:23.875
I took it as an elective.

13:23.958 --> 13:26.625
Professor Rhadani
is an evolutionary biologist.

13:26.708 --> 13:30.750
-She's been leading this research for--
-The last two years.

13:32.500 --> 13:36.791
And Andreas has told me
all about your heroics in Oslo, of course.

13:37.875 --> 13:41.041
I'd have wished for
a slightly different outcome, perhaps.

13:41.125 --> 13:44.583
Having a conscious troll here
would have provided a lot of answers.

13:44.666 --> 13:48.166
Okay, so he's not dead?

13:48.250 --> 13:49.541
No. Hibernating.

13:50.125 --> 13:52.458
Ever since it was discovered here.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.375
The only sign of life is a pulse.

13:55.458 --> 13:58.291
It has some sort of heart.

13:58.375 --> 14:01.458
But the insides look more like

14:02.250 --> 14:05.625
a forest floor than any animal we've seen.

14:05.708 --> 14:09.791
Yeah, its DNA has more in common
with a spruce tree than a human.

14:11.166 --> 14:12.291
Well, they are nature.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.083
What was that?

14:16.166 --> 14:17.583
Trolls are nature.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.750
"Made of earth and stone."

14:20.833 --> 14:23.041
"A snow-clad heart and icy bones."

14:25.041 --> 14:26.708
Nursery rhymes and superstition.

14:30.916 --> 14:32.666
Right. Are we done here?

14:33.625 --> 14:37.041
No. You haven't seen everything yet.
You haven't seen…

14:37.125 --> 14:38.041
Come on.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.416
Welcome to the Nerd Room.

14:53.750 --> 14:55.208
Nora, hi!

14:55.291 --> 14:56.541
Siggy!

14:59.333 --> 15:01.750
It's mine. Ours, I mean.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.250
-Wow!
-We didn't really have that kind of thing.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.500
But then it became that kind of thing.

15:07.583 --> 15:09.208
Yeah, clearly.

15:09.291 --> 15:12.833
Yeah. Which then became
a tiny thing in here.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.416
A little nilbog.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.125
Leonard if it's a boy.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.583
And Uhura if it's a girl.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.125
Congratulations.

15:25.208 --> 15:26.208
Thank you.

15:26.958 --> 15:30.583
But that's not what I wanted to show you.
Look at this.

15:30.666 --> 15:34.125
In here we have texts
written in Latin, Old Norse, and Sanskrit.

15:34.208 --> 15:36.625
Runes that date back to before Christ.

15:37.666 --> 15:40.291
And everything's about trolls.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.125
Check this out.

15:51.625 --> 15:53.875
Saint Olaf's Troll Law.

15:55.416 --> 15:56.250
Huh?

15:57.958 --> 16:00.333
We've dated it to the year 1030,

16:00.416 --> 16:03.583
just before he fell
at the Battle of Stiklestad. Give or take.

16:03.666 --> 16:05.541
Well, maybe not give,

16:05.625 --> 16:09.250
as he wouldn't have been able
to sign anything, so… Yeah.

16:10.458 --> 16:13.125
It's been verified. It's the real deal.

16:13.750 --> 16:16.416
Quite a bit of it is missing,

16:16.500 --> 16:19.083
but there's little doubt
as to its purpose.

16:20.083 --> 16:21.625
"Trolls shall

16:22.833 --> 16:25.041
from this land

16:25.125 --> 16:26.375
be expelled."

16:30.208 --> 16:31.541
Dad was right.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.208
There was a troll at Dovre.

16:36.291 --> 16:37.666
We have a troll here.

16:37.750 --> 16:42.166
The likelihood of there being
more out there is very real.

16:42.250 --> 16:45.416
If the worst were to happen,
and another troll goes berserk,

16:45.500 --> 16:46.708
we need to be prepared.

16:46.791 --> 16:48.708
And in order to prepare, we first need…

16:48.791 --> 16:50.000
To understand.

16:50.625 --> 16:53.250
We have so many resources
at our disposal here,

16:53.958 --> 16:57.666
but despite that,
our research has come to a standstill.

16:58.833 --> 17:00.791
They're threatening to shut us down.

17:01.708 --> 17:04.041
We need someone
who can think outside the box.

17:05.875 --> 17:09.041
We need you, Professor Nora Tidemann.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.291
Well, this is all a bit…

17:26.083 --> 17:28.250
-Is there a restroom around here?
-Yeah.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.916
Down the stairs. There's a sign.
Straight ahead.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.083
I could run there blindfolded
with how much I'm urinat…

17:37.000 --> 17:39.958
-Down the stairs, straight ahead.
-Okay. Thanks.

17:58.416 --> 18:00.250
I've rewritten this report 11 times.

18:00.333 --> 18:02.166
-It's never good enough.
-I know.

18:55.041 --> 18:56.708
Who are you?

19:46.166 --> 19:47.291
Ouch!

20:22.083 --> 20:23.458
Hey.

20:36.458 --> 20:37.416
What's going on here?

20:38.916 --> 20:40.708
An awakening.

20:59.458 --> 21:02.458
UV lights on standby.
Be ready on my signal.

21:09.208 --> 21:11.333
No. No!

21:11.916 --> 21:13.208
Siggy!

21:14.500 --> 21:15.958
I have a bad feeling about this.

21:16.791 --> 21:18.708
-Ready.
-Don't touch that!

21:19.375 --> 21:20.375
What do you mean?

21:20.458 --> 21:22.583
Are you crazy? We can't destroy it.

21:22.666 --> 21:23.791
It's finally awake.

21:28.583 --> 21:29.750
-Now!
-No, don't!

21:29.833 --> 21:31.041
Do it!

21:43.333 --> 21:44.458
Nora!

21:44.541 --> 21:45.708
Get down here!

21:53.083 --> 21:55.166
Siggy, get out. Everybody out!

21:56.583 --> 21:57.666
Everybody out!

22:10.833 --> 22:12.000
Nora!

22:24.708 --> 22:26.083
Come on, Siggy! Run!

22:28.625 --> 22:30.416
Marion, go with Siggy!

22:33.625 --> 22:35.000
Nora. Come on.

22:52.750 --> 22:53.958
Andreas!

23:02.333 --> 23:03.875
Are you okay, Siggy? Come on!

23:32.833 --> 23:34.250
What did you do in there?

23:43.333 --> 23:47.291
AIR FORCE BASE
RYGGE

24:07.541 --> 24:08.916
Captain Kris.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.416
Nora Tidemann.
Right in the middle of it all, as usual.

24:13.291 --> 24:15.833
And Isaksen, tagging along.

24:15.916 --> 24:17.250
Good to see you have support.

24:17.333 --> 24:18.625
Holm.

24:18.708 --> 24:19.833
Please, get in.

24:30.125 --> 24:31.291
Hi.

24:31.375 --> 24:33.291
Hi there. Here.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.250
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

24:44.375 --> 24:45.708
She's new.

24:47.125 --> 24:48.666
Same old Captain Kris, though.

24:48.750 --> 24:51.500
I'm actually a major now.

24:53.791 --> 24:54.750
"Kris-major?"

24:55.875 --> 24:56.875
Yeah.

24:58.083 --> 24:59.791
You can call me whatever you want.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.583
This research could contribute
to medical science, climate--

25:04.666 --> 25:07.291
You've treated it
like a being with no intrinsic worth.

25:07.375 --> 25:08.958
You have to see the big picture.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.708
The problem with your big picture

25:10.791 --> 25:13.333
is that you place humans
above all living things.

25:13.416 --> 25:14.833
-A recipe…
-Both are right.

25:14.916 --> 25:16.166
Andreas, please!

25:16.250 --> 25:19.083
Your research has been entirely unethical.

25:19.166 --> 25:21.791
This is my parents' divorce
all over again.

25:22.583 --> 25:24.916
-Yeah.
-You've ignored what we all know.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.458
That this is a being
with thoughts and feelings.

25:28.041 --> 25:30.208
If you could just pull your heads out of…

25:31.208 --> 25:33.041
-Prime Minister.
-Major Holm.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.000
General.

25:34.083 --> 25:37.291
Prime Minister Brinchmann,
meet Nora Tidemann.

25:37.375 --> 25:39.208
Right. Professor Tidemann.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.125
-Rhadani.
-Hi, Martin.

25:44.333 --> 25:45.458
Isaksen.

25:45.541 --> 25:46.625
Prime Minister.

25:47.208 --> 25:48.333
And you are?

25:49.708 --> 25:52.250
Hodne. Staff Sergeant Hodne.

25:53.375 --> 25:54.625
She's pregnant.

25:55.958 --> 25:56.958
Right.

25:59.666 --> 26:03.250
Ever since the government and I
were informed of Project Jotun,

26:03.333 --> 26:06.291
I've believed that the risk is too great.

26:06.791 --> 26:09.041
What happened today proves I was right.

26:09.125 --> 26:11.500
Martin, if I may?

26:11.583 --> 26:14.375
This could potentially be
a huge opportunity.

26:14.458 --> 26:16.541
If we could get one last chance

26:16.625 --> 26:19.875
to get the troll back under our control,
we could--

26:19.958 --> 26:21.791
You can't control these forces.

26:23.458 --> 26:24.708
It's the wrong approach.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.166
So what is your approach?

26:27.250 --> 26:28.958
Let it wander around freely?

26:29.041 --> 26:31.208
That's not what I'm saying.

26:31.291 --> 26:33.416
I see that this research has great value,

26:33.500 --> 26:35.583
but I must ensure
the safety of Norwegians.

26:35.666 --> 26:38.416
I have to do what I should have done
a long time ago.

26:40.625 --> 26:42.750
I want that troll terminated immediately.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.916
So you're going to make
the same mistakes as last time?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.375
An innocent troll
turned to stone because of us.

26:50.458 --> 26:52.708
-Haven't you learned anything?
-Nora.

26:52.791 --> 26:55.541
I lost my brother three years ago
in a helicopter accident.

26:57.041 --> 27:01.458
In a military operation
involving church bells, of all things.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.833
I won't repeat my predecessor's mistakes.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.750
Major Holm. Convene a briefing.

27:17.833 --> 27:19.291
Roger that, General.

27:39.458 --> 27:42.000
Is that a piece of…

27:43.333 --> 27:45.541
It's a piece of guilty conscience.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.291
To remind myself
of all the mistakes I've made.

27:57.208 --> 27:58.958
I make mistakes all the time.

28:05.750 --> 28:09.208
But as fairy tales teach us,

28:09.291 --> 28:11.333
we learn from our mistakes.

28:17.291 --> 28:18.375
We grow.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.500
And we keep fighting.

28:49.458 --> 28:51.875
-Where are you going?
-On an adventure.

28:58.083 --> 29:00.291
We've tracked the troll into a fog bank,

29:00.375 --> 29:02.750
but it's clearing as evening falls.

29:02.833 --> 29:03.708
Sunset…

29:06.083 --> 29:08.583
Sunset also means
that the enemy can move freely,

29:08.666 --> 29:10.333
so we must act…

29:12.291 --> 29:13.833
We must act quickly.

29:14.416 --> 29:17.583
Aw-Geedi. Time to put
our new toys to the test.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.625
I want everybody ready in 30.
Get moving.

29:23.375 --> 29:25.000
-Kris?
-No.

29:25.833 --> 29:27.583
-I haven't even said--
-I said no.

29:29.041 --> 29:31.541
Check the intel again.
I want us airborne in 45.

29:31.625 --> 29:32.916
-Copy that.
-Amir!

29:34.541 --> 29:36.125
Nice to see you again.

29:37.416 --> 29:39.500
Right. You remember…

29:41.375 --> 29:43.291
-Hard to forget.
-That's right. Hey.

29:43.375 --> 29:46.625
-Yeah?
-Last time, you were a scientific advisor.

29:46.708 --> 29:48.583
Technically. Ish.

29:49.375 --> 29:52.500
It would be irresponsible
for a major to bring civilians along.

29:52.583 --> 29:55.708
Major, schmajor.
There's a troll on the loose.

29:55.791 --> 29:57.458
You'll have to excuse me.

29:57.541 --> 30:00.416
I'm getting bad vibes
seeing you all together again.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.375
-It's not exactly ideal.
-No, far from it.

30:05.166 --> 30:06.083
Kris!

30:06.583 --> 30:08.250
You owe it to my dad.

30:14.250 --> 30:15.333
Well, I mean…

30:15.416 --> 30:17.333
I didn't mean to insinuate that you…

30:17.416 --> 30:19.541
That came out wrong. I didn't mean--

30:19.625 --> 30:22.000
It was a gross misjudgment
to bring you last time.

30:22.791 --> 30:25.958
Lives were lost. I have to live with that.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.708
I won't make the same mistake again.

30:28.791 --> 30:31.166
Listen, Dad died at his happiest.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.291
We gave him that much.

30:37.500 --> 30:38.500
I…

30:39.916 --> 30:41.916
This is my whole life.

30:47.750 --> 30:48.750
Please.

30:59.083 --> 31:01.166
Fine. But only…

31:11.125 --> 31:13.125
Stay in the background and do as I say.

31:13.208 --> 31:15.583
-Are we on the same page?
-Yes, absolutely.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.333
So what's the plan?

31:21.791 --> 31:24.291
The military's new SUNNA helicopter,

31:24.375 --> 31:26.000
custom-built for troll hunting.

31:26.708 --> 31:30.458
Equipped with UV lights powerful enough
to make crispy troll fries.

31:30.541 --> 31:31.375
SUNNA.

31:31.458 --> 31:33.541
Old Norse for "sun."

31:36.041 --> 31:37.250
-Cool.
-Yeah.

31:37.333 --> 31:38.583
We think so too.

31:38.666 --> 31:40.125
And now we have…

31:44.291 --> 31:45.666
Hope you brought sunscreen.

31:46.250 --> 31:48.250
Hey! Got room for more?

31:56.166 --> 31:57.500
Room for one more?

31:57.583 --> 32:00.916
I kind of feel like it's my troll.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.375
The more the merrier.

32:02.458 --> 32:03.916
Oh, thanks.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.083
Is it common practice for majors
to go on these missions?

32:07.166 --> 32:10.166
I'm a pretty hands-on kind of guy,
so to speak.

32:11.875 --> 32:13.333
Follow me.

32:17.166 --> 32:19.000
He's flirting with me, right?

32:19.500 --> 32:21.458
You'll have to get used to it.

32:21.541 --> 32:22.541
Kris?

32:26.125 --> 32:29.541
Promise me you'll return just as tall
and intact, Andropholus Maximus.

32:29.625 --> 32:32.250
Hey, Siggy Starcrash.

32:34.166 --> 32:35.583
I promise you.

32:37.583 --> 32:38.708
And you.

32:42.125 --> 32:43.666
My little stardust.

32:51.250 --> 32:52.208
Isaksen!

32:52.291 --> 32:53.958
Get your ass in gear.

33:01.041 --> 33:02.666
Don't try to be a hero, okay?

33:03.333 --> 33:05.375
You're Clark Kent, not Superman.

33:14.541 --> 33:16.750
I'll be there and back again
before you know it!

33:19.875 --> 33:21.041
I love you.

33:29.833 --> 33:33.958
HEMSEDAL SKI RESORT
BUSKERUD

33:58.875 --> 34:00.250
Just put it on my tab.

34:08.041 --> 34:10.625
Boys! We're here!

35:09.083 --> 35:11.333
Oh, how cute!

35:12.416 --> 35:14.208
-Is that your mom?
-Shut up!

36:09.125 --> 36:10.958
Amir, what do you think?

36:11.041 --> 36:13.458
Looks like the party's over, bro.

36:13.541 --> 36:15.041
It's eating them.

36:15.625 --> 36:16.666
Oh my God!

36:18.250 --> 36:20.833
Tidemann! Sit back down!

36:20.916 --> 36:21.958
I'm holding on.

36:22.041 --> 36:23.500
Safety procedures…

36:27.708 --> 36:29.166
Ready on my command.

36:40.291 --> 36:41.833
Let there be light.

36:47.375 --> 36:48.583
And there was.

36:57.708 --> 36:58.916
We're going in!

37:08.791 --> 37:09.916
Now we're talking.

37:17.750 --> 37:18.583
Kris.

37:22.583 --> 37:23.875
Don't get too close.

37:53.041 --> 37:54.666
Status, Amir?

38:01.541 --> 38:02.625
Amir?

38:05.708 --> 38:06.875
Kris.

38:09.833 --> 38:11.500
It's been an honor, brother.

38:21.083 --> 38:22.708
Amir!

38:24.625 --> 38:26.375
There is no god but Allah.

38:40.416 --> 38:41.666
Kris?

38:49.791 --> 38:50.791
Kris.

38:52.666 --> 38:53.833
Kristoffer?

38:56.250 --> 38:57.500
Don't do anything stupid.

39:07.375 --> 39:08.666
Major Holm!

40:19.375 --> 40:22.375
Allah yerhamo, Amir Aw-Geedi,

40:24.666 --> 40:25.791
my brother.

40:36.625 --> 40:39.208
I didn't know they were such ruthless

40:40.750 --> 40:42.291
killing machines.

40:43.833 --> 40:45.375
Not all of them are like that.

40:46.250 --> 40:47.083
Okay?

40:47.166 --> 40:50.166
We've not seen this before.
The troll from three years ago--

40:50.250 --> 40:53.541
Killed and injured soldiers and civilians,
according to the reports.

40:53.625 --> 40:55.625
The reports didn't mention what he wanted.

40:57.291 --> 40:58.833
That he wanted to go home.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.458
"He. Home."

41:03.416 --> 41:07.041
You should be careful
about humanizing these monsters.

41:11.333 --> 41:14.041
Well, most monsters are created by us.

41:14.125 --> 41:16.125
We've done it no harm.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.666
Maybe not us, but people before us.

41:20.666 --> 41:23.416
And it probably hasn't helped
that you've been prodding it

41:23.500 --> 41:25.291
and experimenting on it for years.

41:26.125 --> 41:28.291
I'll apologize next time I see it.

41:33.333 --> 41:34.458
Can we do that?

41:35.291 --> 41:37.125
Can we communicate with it?

41:38.791 --> 41:42.125
Yes. We can use our grown-up voice
and tell him to stop it.

41:55.416 --> 41:57.375
I might know someone who could.

42:00.083 --> 42:02.583
RESTRICTED MILITARY AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

42:11.291 --> 42:16.000
HJERKINN
DOVRE MOUNTAINS

42:39.375 --> 42:40.666
Here.

42:46.916 --> 42:49.166
Thanks. Kris… toffer.

42:50.083 --> 42:52.333
-Are you guys coming?
-Of course.

42:57.500 --> 43:01.000
I thought the military searched
this entire area three years ago.

43:01.083 --> 43:02.083
Yeah.

43:03.083 --> 43:04.083
They did.

43:09.750 --> 43:12.666
A bit to the left, you say? Okay. There?

43:14.875 --> 43:15.833
Yeah.

43:17.083 --> 43:18.125
That'll do.

43:23.916 --> 43:26.000
Oddrun's going to be pleased.

43:27.708 --> 43:29.541
That's probably her calling.

43:31.958 --> 43:34.791
-Hello? Are you there?
-Yeah, I'm here.

43:34.875 --> 43:38.125
-Say hello when you pick up, Lars.
-Yeah.

43:38.208 --> 43:42.000
-Hello.
-I found the wallpaper for the bedroom.

43:42.083 --> 43:44.208
Anything else I should get while I'm here?

43:44.291 --> 43:45.833
I can barely hear you.

43:45.916 --> 43:48.541
Solo's gone nuts. What is it now?

43:48.625 --> 43:51.916
I asked if there's anything else
I should buy while I'm here.

44:04.125 --> 44:05.583
Lars?

44:15.041 --> 44:16.041
Lars?

44:16.125 --> 44:18.833
Lars, I only need
to get the wallpaper, right?

44:21.166 --> 44:22.500
-Oddrun.
-Yeah?

44:24.041 --> 44:26.250
We're gonna need more than wallpaper.

44:32.791 --> 44:35.500
I'm really sorry about your friend Amir.

44:37.083 --> 44:38.083
Thank you.

44:39.458 --> 44:42.250
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Sorry. Bad timing.

44:42.833 --> 44:43.916
No, it's okay.

44:45.875 --> 44:47.041
He was…

44:50.291 --> 44:51.666
He was like a brother

44:52.333 --> 44:53.541
from a different mother.

44:56.166 --> 44:58.875
-We had similar childhoods.
-Okay.

44:58.958 --> 45:01.500
There was a lot of… stuff.

45:06.125 --> 45:09.041
-I don't know why I'm telling you this.
-It's a good thing.

45:09.125 --> 45:13.000
It seems like there's a really big heart

45:13.083 --> 45:16.541
underneath that really cool uniform.

45:27.916 --> 45:29.625
Jesus, what happened in here?

45:30.583 --> 45:32.083
It's a hunting pit.

45:34.750 --> 45:38.166
According to legend,
they wanted to get rid of the Troll King,

45:39.458 --> 45:44.291
so they kidnapped a troll child
to lure the father here.

45:46.458 --> 45:48.208
Straight into a death trap.

45:53.333 --> 45:55.125
Look at these symbols.

45:56.625 --> 45:58.250
Christian symbols.

45:58.333 --> 46:02.375
They carved them everywhere
to inflict maximum damage on the trolls.

46:03.666 --> 46:07.750
But the Troll King survived.
He got out three years ago.

46:08.583 --> 46:10.375
But if that story's true,

46:10.458 --> 46:14.958
it's odd that the remains
of the troll child were never found.

46:19.375 --> 46:20.375
Hold still.

46:21.458 --> 46:22.458
Stay still.

46:52.583 --> 46:53.666
Don't freak out.

46:53.750 --> 46:54.750
Just

46:55.541 --> 46:57.083
try to remain calm.

46:58.500 --> 47:00.125
It's hypernature.

47:13.125 --> 47:14.250
Shush. Kris.

47:22.250 --> 47:23.833
Put away your weapon.

47:24.375 --> 47:25.583
Very carefully.

47:28.750 --> 47:31.208
Don't shine it directly into his eyes.

47:32.416 --> 47:33.375
There.

47:38.833 --> 47:39.708
Keep still.

47:57.750 --> 48:01.291
I came down here so many times
without ever finding anything.

48:02.750 --> 48:06.416
But he was watching from the shadows,
waiting until he felt safe.

48:06.500 --> 48:08.833
-Is it really…
-Yes.

48:08.916 --> 48:10.833
The son of the Mountain King.

48:26.708 --> 48:27.875
Hey, Beautiful.

49:03.291 --> 49:06.375
Nora Tidemann, the troll whisperer.

49:09.250 --> 49:10.666
How do you do it?

49:11.583 --> 49:14.041
I don't know. I just…

49:16.125 --> 49:17.208
feel it.

49:18.291 --> 49:19.666
Somehow.

49:28.541 --> 49:30.416
Come here. It's all right.

49:47.916 --> 49:49.083
Don't think.

49:50.708 --> 49:51.916
Just feel.

50:31.625 --> 50:32.666
Hello.

50:35.500 --> 50:36.708
What's your name?

50:36.791 --> 50:38.416
I call him Beautiful.

50:39.375 --> 50:40.375
Beautiful.

50:41.625 --> 50:42.875
Nice to meet you.

50:43.375 --> 50:44.666
Magical.

50:54.041 --> 50:55.333
And now

50:55.416 --> 50:57.333
comes the hard part.

50:58.125 --> 51:01.666
There's someone we need to talk to, so…

51:04.166 --> 51:07.041
I have a very big favor to ask of you.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.500
This isn't our fight.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.666
Let's start her up.

53:37.708 --> 53:38.625
Nora!

53:38.708 --> 53:40.041
-Run!
-Pull back!

54:14.833 --> 54:15.833
Come on!

54:19.541 --> 54:20.708
Come on!

54:24.958 --> 54:26.125
Come on!

54:32.208 --> 54:33.416
Come on!

55:28.416 --> 55:33.375
DOMBÅS AIR AMBULANCE BASE
DOVRE MOUNTAINS

55:53.958 --> 55:54.958
How…

55:56.333 --> 55:57.916
How did you figure it out?

55:58.500 --> 56:00.083
How to communicate with him?

56:06.958 --> 56:09.916
I had to learn how to listen.

56:10.666 --> 56:12.666
I mean, really listen.

56:13.625 --> 56:15.250
Listen with my heart.

56:20.375 --> 56:24.250
I actually brought him
out of the cave once before.

56:27.416 --> 56:29.958
And he was so careful.

56:32.125 --> 56:33.750
He just sat there…

56:35.750 --> 56:37.458
looking up at the stars.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.208
And then he went back into the darkness.

56:45.750 --> 56:47.125
Where he felt safe.

57:16.708 --> 57:18.250
It's like the Pilgrim's Route.

57:20.416 --> 57:21.375
What did you say?

57:21.458 --> 57:24.166
The pilgrimage to Nidaros
and Saint Olaf's spring.

57:24.250 --> 57:25.375
Look at this.

57:26.041 --> 57:29.000
If you follow the troll's tracks,
heading north,

57:30.833 --> 57:32.166
across Dovre,

57:32.708 --> 57:34.583
straight for Trondheim.

57:47.083 --> 57:48.625
Tank's full.

57:54.125 --> 57:56.791
-What's up?
-We've got a troll on a pilgrimage.

57:58.000 --> 57:58.958
Right.

58:00.583 --> 58:02.416
Olaf showed them no mercy.

58:03.500 --> 58:05.083
And the age of trolls

58:05.833 --> 58:06.833
was over.

58:08.833 --> 58:10.708
Dad always talked about it.

58:11.708 --> 58:14.500
About the Christianization of Norway

58:14.583 --> 58:16.125
and the troll massacre,

58:16.208 --> 58:19.500
and how Saint Olaf
drove the trolls out of the country.

58:22.958 --> 58:25.375
In those days, Nidaros was the capital.

58:26.541 --> 58:28.708
That was where Olaf
ruled the country from.

58:34.083 --> 58:35.416
He wants revenge.

59:02.708 --> 59:05.458
Esther Johanne Tiller.
Welcome to Trondheim.

59:05.541 --> 59:07.458
-Nora--
-I can tell you're a Tidemann.

59:07.541 --> 59:10.083
You're the spitting image of your dad.

59:10.666 --> 59:11.875
Is that good?

59:12.583 --> 59:15.375
Tobias was an interesting character.

59:15.458 --> 59:18.375
But he sure was a hoot at parties.

59:18.458 --> 59:21.166
-Andreas Isaksen.
-The rest of the motley crew.

59:21.250 --> 59:23.666
We can't hang around here all day.
Disserway!

59:27.916 --> 59:29.000
Nidaros Cathedral.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.625
Built between 1070 and 1300, more or less.

59:34.208 --> 59:38.000
Up until the Reformation,
it was called Cor Norvegiae.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.750
"The Heart of Norway."

59:42.375 --> 59:45.375
From here, the Church
ruled the country with an iron fist.

59:45.875 --> 59:47.708
I'm sure you're not here for a lecture.

59:47.791 --> 59:50.250
We're here to find Saint Olaf's tomb.

59:51.458 --> 59:52.625
That's all we've got.

59:53.291 --> 59:56.166
Right. Just as batty as your dad too.

59:56.791 --> 59:57.791
Disserway.

01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:04.875
We think the troll's coming here
to exact revenge on Saint Olaf.

01:00:05.583 --> 01:00:07.208
I read your book.

01:00:07.291 --> 01:00:10.916
Your theory is that Olaf's remains
are still somewhere in the cathedral?

01:00:11.666 --> 01:00:13.500
People say, "Think outside the box."

01:00:13.583 --> 01:00:16.875
But I think the answer
might lie inside the box.

01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:19.333
That it's staring you right in the face.

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:22.291
Then let's take a look
inside that box of yours.

01:00:24.583 --> 01:00:26.125
Like all beautiful things,

01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:29.291
Nidaros Cathedral also has
a less flattering underside.

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:30.500
Disserway!

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:32.583
What does she mean by "disserway"?

01:00:32.666 --> 01:00:34.750
"This. Here. Way," Isaksen.

01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:36.458
Gunk in the brain again.

01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:38.833
You might ask yourself,

01:00:38.916 --> 01:00:40.958
"If Olaf was so important to the Church,

01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:42.625
why hide him?"

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:48.083
Yeah. Unless it was something
Olaf and the Church disagreed on.

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:52.875
Right. You don't hide
something you're proud of.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.791
No.

01:00:55.875 --> 01:00:59.791
People have been digging around down here
for years until they go soft in the head

01:00:59.875 --> 01:01:01.083
and find diddly-squat.

01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:03.750
But by all means, knock yourselves out.

01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:17.416
So, where do we start?

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:29.125
It's the same symbol we saw in the cave.

01:01:42.458 --> 01:01:43.500
Oh, yeah.

01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:47.125
When I found this room,
there was a real hullabaloo.

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:50.125
Everyone thought we'd found the tomb.

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:53.875
And maybe he laid here for a while
before he was moved.

01:01:54.416 --> 01:01:56.750
God knows by whom or why.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.791
Maybe we should get going?

01:02:13.041 --> 01:02:15.250
There's not that much more

01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:16.875
to see here now, at least.

01:02:36.916 --> 01:02:40.041
-Let me see.
-I'm sorry. I barely touched it.

01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:43.291
I think it was already broken.
It's an easy fix.

01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:44.541
Move over.

01:02:46.416 --> 01:02:47.416
Sorry.

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:53.958
A spear in the belly.

01:02:56.833 --> 01:02:58.083
Could it be…

01:03:08.125 --> 01:03:11.166
-It's the wounds.
-What do you mean?

01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:13.916
That's where Olaf was stabbed
by Tore Hund and his men

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.708
at the Battle of Stiklestad.

01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:19.458
First, a cut to the thigh.

01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:22.166
Then a spear in the belly.

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:24.583
And finally…

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.541
a blow to the neck.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.833
Do we have something we can…

01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:54.000
Look.

01:03:54.791 --> 01:03:56.208
I'll try using this.

01:04:09.416 --> 01:04:11.041
Nora! Here!

01:04:12.666 --> 01:04:15.041
First in the thigh.

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:18.083
Then a spear in the belly.

01:04:22.166 --> 01:04:23.166
Here!

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.750
And then a blow to the neck.

01:04:46.166 --> 01:04:47.625
I'll help you pull.

01:04:47.708 --> 01:04:48.750
Okay.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:40.041
The answer lies inside the box.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.541
Staring you right in the face.

01:05:54.541 --> 01:05:56.458
Watch out for the water.

01:05:56.541 --> 01:05:58.583
Maybe this is Saint Olaf's spring.

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:24.125
Okay.

01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:25.583
Wait!

01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:28.708
We can't just open it.

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:32.416
This is Olaf the Holy!

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.083
We don't know that.
We have to open it.

01:06:35.166 --> 01:06:37.291
This. Is. Olaf.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.208
I can feel it.

01:06:41.125 --> 01:06:44.250
Esther, I respect your respect.

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:48.833
I get that this is a historic moment,
but this tomb might help us understand,

01:06:48.916 --> 01:06:50.708
and we're running out of time.

01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:56.625
All right, then.

01:06:56.708 --> 01:06:57.875
But…

01:06:59.541 --> 01:07:01.541
respectfully, please.

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:03.708
Of course. Naturally.

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:21.125
Look at him.

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:28.875
Hey there, handsome.

01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:33.625
So this is where you've been hiding?

01:07:35.541 --> 01:07:37.750
You old rascal.

01:07:42.541 --> 01:07:44.250
How strange.

01:07:45.625 --> 01:07:47.375
-What?
-It's Bæsing.

01:07:48.166 --> 01:07:49.541
Olaf's sword.

01:07:51.083 --> 01:07:53.541
Still intact after all these years.

01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:58.875
It's silver. Which we all know is
a useless material to make weapons out of.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.875
It's too soft.

01:08:00.958 --> 01:08:03.291
But it doesn't rust, though.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.541
What's this?

01:08:11.666 --> 01:08:13.375
Careful.

01:08:21.958 --> 01:08:23.333
This can't be right.

01:08:40.166 --> 01:08:42.500
I think we'd better phone home.

01:08:42.583 --> 01:08:44.875
Just hold it still for a second.

01:08:44.958 --> 01:08:46.500
And down.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.333
And

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:50.583
got it.

01:08:54.166 --> 01:08:57.583
You just completed the quest
and may level up before the final boss.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.375
Look.

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:08.000
"Trolls shall not

01:09:08.083 --> 01:09:10.208
from this land be expelled."

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:12.916
This changes everything.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:18.416
"For all the injustice
we have inflicted upon the Jotuns,

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:21.458
they shall have their home."

01:09:21.541 --> 01:09:23.625
HEIMS JOTNA

01:09:23.708 --> 01:09:24.625
Jotunheimen.

01:09:24.708 --> 01:09:27.958
He wasn't trying to eradicate them.
He wanted to give them a home.

01:09:28.708 --> 01:09:31.041
This is why Olaf was murdered.

01:09:31.708 --> 01:09:33.916
The Church wanted
to continue the eradication.

01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:41.041
It's not Olaf he wants revenge on.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.708
It's everything our nation is founded on.

01:09:45.833 --> 01:09:47.083
It's all of us.

01:09:53.541 --> 01:09:56.125
After unconfirmed reports,
it became apparent yesterday

01:09:56.208 --> 01:09:58.666
that a new giant monster
is on the loose in the country

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.583
after Hemsedal was attacked.

01:10:04.416 --> 01:10:05.916
Oh, how cute!

01:10:16.583 --> 01:10:20.791
Images from Norway show
the destruction caused by the monster.

01:10:20.875 --> 01:10:23.750
A couple in Lesja had their house
destroyed by a troll

01:10:23.833 --> 01:10:25.416
for the second time.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.625
There are reports of loss of life…

01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:30.583
…both military and civilian.
Simply terrible.

01:10:36.416 --> 01:10:39.208
Trondheim was our capital
a thousand years ago.

01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:42.166
Is this a king
trying to reclaim his throne?

01:10:46.083 --> 01:10:48.791
The incident has sparked
an international outcry.

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:51.375
If this is a threat to the motherland,

01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:53.416
we will take control of the situation.

01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:07.625
The events of the last 24 hours
seem unreal to us all.

01:11:09.458 --> 01:11:11.625
Sadly, we must now face the fact that

01:11:14.416 --> 01:11:15.708
Trondheim is lost.

01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:17.208
Prime Minister!

01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:19.625
What's the strategy moving forward?

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:23.083
We're doing all we can to evacuate
and protect the people of Trondheim.

01:11:23.166 --> 01:11:24.833
But what happens after Trondheim?

01:11:30.166 --> 01:11:31.166
That

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:35.333
will have to be addressed later.
Thank you.

01:11:36.208 --> 01:11:37.750
We have played all our cards.

01:11:37.833 --> 01:11:41.625
But the enemy has broken through
and will be in Trondheim within two hours.

01:11:41.708 --> 01:11:44.958
We have deployed forces
to evacuate as many people as possible.

01:11:45.041 --> 01:11:46.541
Get out of there.

01:11:46.625 --> 01:11:47.541
Copy that.

01:11:49.416 --> 01:11:50.875
We can't leave.

01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:53.291
No, we can't.

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:54.958
Okay, but, Kris, if you just…

01:11:55.916 --> 01:11:56.958
Huh?

01:11:57.041 --> 01:12:00.541
I can't in good conscience
just walk away and watch this happen.

01:12:00.625 --> 01:12:01.625
No way.

01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:03.375
People,

01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:07.583
good people, have sacrificed their lives.

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.375
We owe it to them to resist.

01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:13.375
-Okay.
-I'm in.

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:18.333
Andreas.

01:12:22.166 --> 01:12:24.708
-Maybe you should…
-Yeah.

01:12:24.791 --> 01:12:26.416
You have a family to consider.

01:12:28.791 --> 01:12:30.125
That's what I'm doing.

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:35.583
If Trondheim falls…

01:12:37.791 --> 01:12:39.208
it won't stop there.

01:12:42.125 --> 01:12:43.416
I'm staying.

01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:48.625
Well, I live here.

01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:51.916
Okay. What are we going to fight with?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.250
Bullets and gunpowder won't work.

01:12:54.333 --> 01:12:56.750
Church bells work to a certain degree.

01:12:56.833 --> 01:12:57.875
That…

01:12:57.958 --> 01:13:01.458
What weapons did Olaf use?
Other than sunshine, of course.

01:13:03.166 --> 01:13:04.166
Bæsing.

01:13:04.791 --> 01:13:07.541
The silver sword? Does silver work?

01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:10.375
-Silver must be magical, then.
-Yeah.

01:13:10.458 --> 01:13:13.583
The only magical thing about silver
is that it doesn't corrode.

01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:18.125
-It's water-resistant.
-Right.

01:13:19.875 --> 01:13:21.708
Maybe it's not the silver?

01:13:21.791 --> 01:13:24.250
Don't look at me. You lost me way back.

01:13:47.458 --> 01:13:48.625
Holy water.

01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:51.250
-Yeah.
-That's what Olaf used on the sword.

01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:53.125
Nursery rhymes and superstition.

01:13:54.833 --> 01:13:57.250
Okay, first of all, that's insane.

01:13:57.875 --> 01:14:02.041
Second, we'll need a little more water
than what's in that kiddie pool.

01:14:02.125 --> 01:14:03.041
So what do we do?

01:14:04.708 --> 01:14:05.541
Right.

01:14:08.166 --> 01:14:10.041
Are you guys slow or something?

01:14:11.458 --> 01:14:16.000
We've just stumbled upon
one of the world's most mythical springs.

01:14:16.083 --> 01:14:17.416
Saint Olaf's spring.

01:14:19.083 --> 01:14:20.708
-We have ammo.
-Now we need people.

01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:28.666
Trondheim is being evacuated!
Everyone, get on a bus!

01:14:36.458 --> 01:14:37.541
Up here!

01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:44.333
People of Trøndelag!

01:14:44.416 --> 01:14:46.166
When the storm is raging,

01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:48.625
it's easy to turn your back to it,

01:14:48.708 --> 01:14:51.291
but I promise you
that the sun that set this evening--

01:14:51.375 --> 01:14:54.166
People, there's a psycho troll
right around the corner.

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:56.541
We have a crazy plan
and precious little time.

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:58.291
Who's with us?

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:03.041
-I'm down!
-For Trondheim!

01:15:24.375 --> 01:15:25.541
Thank you so much.

01:15:27.333 --> 01:15:28.416
Perfect!

01:15:31.458 --> 01:15:33.166
Great work, everyone!

01:15:58.291 --> 01:16:00.333
Guys! The enemy is on the move!

01:16:00.416 --> 01:16:03.833
Keep up the pace! Tempo, tempo!

01:16:21.416 --> 01:16:22.416
Yeah, Siggy.

01:16:23.541 --> 01:16:26.333
I promise. I'm just on bell duty.

01:16:26.416 --> 01:16:27.916
I'll call you back.

01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:41.541
Do you have faith?

01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:49.833
When Mom died, I thought
that if I just believed hard enough,

01:16:49.916 --> 01:16:52.791
she'd be up there, watching over us.

01:16:55.875 --> 01:16:56.833
But…

01:16:57.833 --> 01:17:00.541
Well, faith isn't something
that can be forced, so…

01:17:02.208 --> 01:17:03.791
I have faith that she sees you.

01:17:06.458 --> 01:17:08.333
And I have faith in you,

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:11.416
bonkers as you are.

01:17:13.458 --> 01:17:16.375
It's thanks to you
we're standing here together.

01:17:19.625 --> 01:17:21.125
Or is it thanks to you?

01:17:30.291 --> 01:17:31.666
What if we fail?

01:17:33.916 --> 01:17:37.666
I'd rather follow my heart and fail
than do something I don't believe in.

01:17:43.583 --> 01:17:44.583
Yeah.

01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:48.541
You're going to be a great dad.

01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.000
I hope so.

01:18:34.666 --> 01:18:36.250
If this works…

01:18:37.041 --> 01:18:38.250
It has to.

01:18:50.958 --> 01:18:53.500
Looks like you could use a fistful of Zen.

01:18:55.958 --> 01:18:58.208
I've read your book, of course.

01:18:58.291 --> 01:19:01.125
It was a hoot. You should write another.

01:19:04.166 --> 01:19:06.000
Sequels are never any good anyway.

01:19:06.083 --> 01:19:08.166
Balderdash!

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:10.666
Everyone loves sequels!

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:42.708
Nine-eight, on my command.

01:19:43.291 --> 01:19:44.500
Roger. We're ready.

01:20:11.708 --> 01:20:12.833
Okay, let's go.

01:20:13.833 --> 01:20:16.000
Isaksen, it's showtime.

01:20:16.958 --> 01:20:19.583
-Engage!
-Let's play, guys!

01:20:32.291 --> 01:20:33.791
Nine-eight, open fire!

01:21:00.083 --> 01:21:01.500
Damn, I think it's working!

01:21:24.166 --> 01:21:26.291
Isaksen! Status?

01:21:33.916 --> 01:21:37.208
Nine-eight, pull out! I repeat, pull out!

01:21:56.708 --> 01:21:57.708
Come get some.

01:22:09.708 --> 01:22:11.000
This is working!

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Or not.

01:22:21.083 --> 01:22:22.333
We have to pull back.

01:22:24.291 --> 01:22:25.875
Pull back!

01:22:26.583 --> 01:22:27.416
Run!

01:22:33.208 --> 01:22:35.833
Isaksen! Pull out!

01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:55.125
Beautiful.

01:23:48.375 --> 01:23:50.625
-Nora!
-He's killing him!

01:23:50.708 --> 01:23:53.291
We can shoot all we want.
It won't pierce his skin.

01:23:53.375 --> 01:23:54.833
But from the inside.

01:23:54.916 --> 01:23:58.083
It has an ecosystem,
and a heart that pumps in the body.

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:01.291
If we can get water inside the system,
we can kill it from within.

01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:03.666
How do we do that?

01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:11.208
If we position the helicopter
above his head,

01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:13.625
we can drop the bomb into his mouth!

01:24:13.708 --> 01:24:16.458
Isaksen, you've seriously watched
way too many movies.

01:24:21.291 --> 01:24:23.416
How many bombs do we have left?

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:32.583
This is the last one.

01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:40.791
Whatever we do, we have to do it now.

01:24:42.666 --> 01:24:44.000
Stall him!

01:24:45.708 --> 01:24:48.500
Kris! I need a pilot!

01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:27.625
Tell me. How are you gonna
make him look up and open his mouth?

01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:30.666
We'll figure it out as we go.

01:25:31.416 --> 01:25:32.416
Wonderful.

01:25:49.041 --> 01:25:50.750
-Got room for one more?
-Please.

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:15.500
The detonator! We've lost the detonator!

01:26:24.166 --> 01:26:26.250
-I'm going to land!
-No!

01:26:26.333 --> 01:26:29.041
Isaksen, it can only
be triggered manually now.

01:26:29.625 --> 01:26:32.875
How do you do that?
How do you trigger it manually?

01:26:33.416 --> 01:26:36.041
You need an explosive
to ignite the bomb.

01:26:36.125 --> 01:26:37.875
Like a hand grenade.

01:26:39.958 --> 01:26:43.625
But the pin must be pulled
right before the bomb enters his mouth.

01:26:46.041 --> 01:26:49.583
So someone has to jump with the bomb
and pull the pin on the way down.

01:26:49.666 --> 01:26:50.666
Yes!

01:27:13.458 --> 01:27:14.458
No!

01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:19.708
No.

01:27:29.958 --> 01:27:32.250
-Get us into position.
-Isaksen.

01:27:36.291 --> 01:27:37.625
Nora, we have to go.

01:27:38.666 --> 01:27:40.291
-Nora?
-No!

01:27:41.416 --> 01:27:43.750
Nora! Run!

01:27:43.833 --> 01:27:44.833
No!

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.041
Kris, it's now or never!

01:27:51.541 --> 01:27:54.375
He won't stop here!
It's up to us!

01:28:04.875 --> 01:28:06.541
Nora!

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:18.458
Siggy!

01:28:19.416 --> 01:28:20.250
Andreas.

01:28:20.333 --> 01:28:21.666
Honey.

01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:23.458
Did you go on a side quest?

01:28:23.541 --> 01:28:25.333
It's like Spock says.

01:28:30.791 --> 01:28:32.000
What do you mean?

01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:33.458
We're in position.

01:28:38.791 --> 01:28:40.666
Andreas, what are you…

01:29:00.458 --> 01:29:03.291
Tell the little one that Daddy was--

01:29:15.041 --> 01:29:16.708
That Daddy…

01:29:32.375 --> 01:29:34.250
That Daddy was…

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.333
Superman.

01:32:42.416 --> 01:32:44.291
But of course, it doesn't end here.

01:32:48.041 --> 01:32:51.833
No, this fairy tale has only just begun.

01:32:53.125 --> 01:32:55.000
ESTHER JOHANNE TILLER
OLAF BENEATH US

01:32:56.458 --> 01:32:58.166
Because when something falls…

01:32:58.958 --> 01:33:00.750
it can be raised again.

01:33:03.708 --> 01:33:05.708
And when someone is lost…

01:33:06.375 --> 01:33:07.833
new life springs up.

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:10.541
Yes. Little Uhura.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.666
New bonds are forged.

01:33:18.833 --> 01:33:20.583
Old ones grow stronger.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.875
And even in the darkest of times,

01:33:29.125 --> 01:33:30.250
there is hope.

01:33:34.791 --> 01:33:35.791
Hope…

01:33:37.458 --> 01:33:40.541
of one day finding your family.

01:33:42.583 --> 01:33:45.708
Hope of finding your way back,

01:33:48.083 --> 01:33:51.583
back to a place where you can feel free.

01:33:56.583 --> 01:33:59.541
A place you can call

01:34:01.166 --> 01:34:02.291
home.
