00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.520
What are you talking about?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.400
I...

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.800
I don't understand at all.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.400
Father,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.880
please don't worry.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.440
This imperial marriage

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.280
was granted by the Emperor
on purpose.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.440
His aim

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.040
is to support the generals.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.480
Ever since we first returned
from Pingxiang,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.520
Nan Chenxiao

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.680
has held command of
the Chongming Guard.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.400
Now he serves
the Emperor.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.200
He has been waiting for the day
the Military Imperial Examination returns,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.840
so he can fight as a man
on the battlefield

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.280
and restore the Nan family's honor.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.800
What you said,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.000
is it really true?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.880
Every word is true.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.720
Nan Chenxiao's trip this time

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.880
is to carry out a mission
for the Emperor.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.760
If you don't believe me,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.440
this is Nan Chenxiao's
own letter.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.760
Please take a look.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.040
It really is Chenxiao's
handwriting.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.160
Good.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.400
Good indeed.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.200
Our Nan family finally
has hope again.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.680
It's just that

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.040
this marriage of yours...

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.920
Before the great cause succeeds,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.680
this marriage

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.640
must go on as an act.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.000
That's true.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.280
You've helped us so much.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.240
Even without this marriage,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.640
by now we

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.600
are already family.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.520
I may not be very capable,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.440
but in the imperial court

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.640
I'll try my best not
to trouble you.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.400
What are you two talking about?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.760
You've talked for so long.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.200
We were just talking

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.480
about court affairs.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.160
What is this?

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.640
A secret.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.840
Hurry and go out.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.160
Go on.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.000
Madam, I...

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.480
Rui Yu, sit down.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.160
I have something for you.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.560
Come, put this on.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.000
Mother,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.000
I really can't wear this.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.680
It wouldn't be right.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.720
Put it on.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.440
Your hands are slim
and slender.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.520
The bracelet looks
lovely on you.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.920
I...

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.120
This bracelet

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.840
was part of my dowry
when I married.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.360
It is the one I cherish most.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.840
I always meant to save it
for my daughter‑in‑law.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.000
Mother...

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.200
I...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.880
I just miss my son.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.160
I don't even know

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.280
when Xingxiao
will be back.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.960
My royal brother is
reviewing memorials,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.120
Mother is sleeping,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.080
and I can't leave
the palace.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.320
This is far too boring.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.360
What is that bad fox doing?

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.040
He must be out
playing in the streets,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.000
running into lots
of fun things.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.200
My heart is a web
of longing.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.520
In time it will tie
into endless knots.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.320
Bad fox, I saw it.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.120
Bad fox, I saw it.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.680
I...

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.840
Bad fox,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.680
I saw it.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.040
Little bunny,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.800
I wish you peace
and joy,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.280
and that you will
meet your true love.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.840
I can copy
your handwriting,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.960
but I can never replace
your presence.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.600
Nan Chenxiao,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.600
where on earth are you?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.040
If you are dead,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.160
what am I supposed to do?

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.320
I'm sorry.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.680
If I die,

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.920
this marriage

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.040
will no longer exist.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.240
I...

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.320
I also hope you can make the Military

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.040
Imperial Examination go smoothly

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.240
and be fully implemented.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.760
My wish now

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.720
is simply to fulfill yours.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.080
Capital Guard Commander Zou Qingyu

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.320
requested retirement due to injury

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.280
and returned home before last year.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.720
The Metropolitan Governor post

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.880
has also been vacant since then.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.640
I hope, Your Majesty,

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.760
you will select successors soon.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.000
My ministers, do you have nominees?

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.720
I recommend Sub‑Governor Wang Yisheng

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.720
and Suzhou Vice Prefect He Zhiqiu,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.320
whose conduct and ability are excellent,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.200
either could serve as Metropolitan Governor.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.320
The Censor’s wife is Ming Qiuhao’s cousin.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.200
The Vice Minister of Rites is unrelated

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.120
but He Zhiqiu studied under his master.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.040
I instead recommend

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.360
Hanlin Academician Liu Zhi as Governor.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.840
Liu Zhi

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.320
tried several cases the Left Minister backed.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.000
Replying to Your Majesty,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.400
that is correct.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.760
Where is Liu Zhi?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.360
Fourth‑rank Hanlin Academician Liu Zhi

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.560
greets Your Majesty.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.360
You judged that case quite well.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.440
In that case,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.760
you shall be Metropolitan Governor.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.960
Report to your post tomorrow.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.640
I

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.800
obey Your Majesty’s decree.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.320
For Capital Guard Commander,

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.560
I recommend Vice Minister Wei Ming.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.240
Though Wei Ming serves in the Ministry,

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.760
he is not versed in military affairs.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.480
The capital region is too critical.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:31.880
General Nan,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.000
you shall assume this command.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.080
I

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.520
am already advanced in years,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.280
I fear I cannot manage it.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.840
General Nan is in his prime

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.800
and can bear this commander’s post.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.280
I

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.960
accept the decree.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.880
This time you dragged me onto your ship.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.520
Yet once the edict was issued,

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.440
I instead felt full of drive.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.560
Lord Liu,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.520
you should have felt so long ago.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.880
Lord Rui is right about that.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.560
General Nan,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.400
His Majesty meant me for Guard Commander.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.680
Why did you not warn me earlier?

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.680
I also only learned

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.320
in court today.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.240
But this is a good thing.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.240
With Father in an important post,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.920
others won’t trouble him so easily.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.960
I only fear you’ll be targeted

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.720
and dragged into trouble for him.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.400
If soldiers come, the general blocks.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.640
If floods come, earth dams them.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.960
We’ll counter each move as it comes.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:54.760
Let’s go.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.640
I wish to appoint the worthy

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.640
from the new generation of officials

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.600
to mend the civil‑military rift

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.080
and thereby advance the Military Exam.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.560
Lord Rui,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.200
there is one thing I still doubt.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.040
You are the Left Minister’s disciple,

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.160
and deeply favored by the Emperor.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.200
Why

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.840
would you choose to support me?

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.720
Because you are upright

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.840
and have no bias against generals,

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:29.840
and

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.480
you never join factional strife.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.360
What the court lacks most today

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.000
is forthright officials like you.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.040
Your name truly suits your nature.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.000
The time has come.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.480
Enter the hall.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.480
You all sit for this exam today

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.240
for the sake of your future,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.400
and for Ling An’s future.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.120
Whether you pass the list or not,

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.640
hold rites and law in your hearts,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.200
revere the Emperor’s grace,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.840
and you will see it through.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.640
Announce the topic.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.160
Today’s palace examination topic is:

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.800
“The way to secure the nation’s army.”

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.400
Your Highness, please.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.160
Prime Minister Ming.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.160
Please, Minister Ming.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.600
is the way to secure a mighty army.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.880
This is what Rui Yu is doing.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.120
He wants to start with the exams

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.160
to push for the Military Imperial Exam,

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.200
cultivating new forces for himself.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.840
Well?

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.960
Your Highness, even now

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.720
you still want to win Rui Yu over?

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.080
Minister Ming,

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.800
how could I be so short‑sighted?

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.040
Come.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.520
To get this done,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.520
you’ll need both money and men.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.760
Your Highness should care more about it.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.360
Yes.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.280
I still have matters to attend to.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.280
I shall take my leave first.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.400
Minister Ming, take care.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.200
This Ming Qiuhao

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.000
is actually so rude to Your Highness.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.040
He is the chancellor of a strong state;

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.280
why would he value a mere hostage prince?

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.480
In fact,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.440
if Your Highness truly fancies Lord Rui,

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.960
why not expose her true identity?

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.480
Then you two could—

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.240
That would only make her hate me more.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.040
It would also harm the greater cause.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.680
Only once I become Prince Qian Yuan

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.080
can I marry her without wronging her.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.120
Elder Brother,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.080
any boat crossing this river,

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.640
I’ll cut it in two without mercy.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.240
Charge!

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.480
Pass down the order:

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.960
the King of Da Yue is dead.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.360
All who surrender to Wu Rong

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.560
shall be treated with favor.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.360
Young Master Beicheng,

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.880
why not stay here

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.800
and conquer these grasslands with me?

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.320
Father,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.120
Lady Ming is here as well.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.480
Your Highness.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:56.760
You may go.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.720
I have matters to discuss with him.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:17:59.800
Yes.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.200
Your son will take his leave.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.560
Please, sit.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.640
You were so eager to see me,

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.800
what is this about?

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.280
My men sent word to me:

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.040
this time the scripts’ review

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.400
was done solely by Rui Yu.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.680
And my own protégés?

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.600
Only three even made the list.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.480
Given Lord Rui’s way of doing things,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.960
this is also within

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.160
what one would expect.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.680
These three men,

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.680
I can place them in key posts.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.040
But the top three

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.240
are all from humble families.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.200
Rui Yu is chief examiner of this Spring Exam,

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.600
so these three men

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.760
are effectively his protégés.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.520
No vested interest can threaten them.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.240
So, Lord Ming,

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.120
what do you intend to do?

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.000
Kill them.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.320
As for who ranks first,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.560
the Emperor will decide.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.440
But

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.600
it can’t be anyone but these three.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.560
Killing them before the exam ends,

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.200
such a big move—

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.800
I fear my men will be exposed.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:23.680
Minister Ming,

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.080
it must be done before results are posted.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.800
Once these three are dead,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.000
the vacant spots are filled,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.560
and Rui Yu alone won’t decide it.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.320
Of course,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.720
to leave no loose ends,

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.840
we must rely on Your Highness’s skill.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:41.920
Minister Ming,

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.440
if we startle the snake in the grass,

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.240
we’ll suffer heavy losses too.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.720
So please think twice, Minister.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.200
They’ve already taken the post of
Metropolitan Governor.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.720
If a few more newbies enter the Six
Ministries,

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.560
once my power wanes,

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.360
Your Highness,

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.960
will you still have a chance to
return to Qian Yuan?

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.040
I hear your second brother

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.360
is deeply favored by the Qian Yuan
Emperor.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.440
If he takes the throne,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.960
who would care about a hostage prince,

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.680
the life or death of an ill‑omened man?

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.400
Lord Ming,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.120
why twist the knife in my wound?

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.520
This was supposed to be

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.080
our grand scheme together.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.800
Here, Your Highness.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.240
It is your turn now.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.880
After these days of fierce battle,

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.560
we finally captured Da Yue’s princes.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.600
Now

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.480
this river is finally Wu Rong’s.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.240
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.400
I wonder, Your Majesty,

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.320
when will you seek peace with Ling An?

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.440
No hurry.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.840
We can wait till things settle.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.760
Young Master Beicheng,

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.280
are you feeling homesick?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:19.600
Look,

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.000
Ling An lies in that direction.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.120
Why not bring your family to Wu Rong?

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.640
That is indeed an idea.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.920
If you wed Mu Ya,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.680
you will be my brother‑in‑law.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.760
Bring your family from Ling An,

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.280
we will live as one happy family.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.600
Please do not jest, Your Majesty.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.680
The princess is of noble rank.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.080
Besides,

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.200
I am already married in Ling An.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.000
For a man,

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.400
several wives and concubines are normal.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.280
Does Ling An not have

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.840
that “co‑wife” custom?

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.680
Then I shall decide:

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.200
your wife back home

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.800
will be your co‑wife.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.400
I will go and see.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.200
Hyah!

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.520
Follow him, do not let trouble arise.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.000
Yes.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:11.480
Hyah!

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:14.600
Hyah!

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.400
Right now their patrols

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.080
are at their weakest.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.960
Use the shift change to drug upstream.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.920
We will then take the chance—

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.320
Trying to poison the river?

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.560
Keep dreaming.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.800
Who goes there? After them!

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.200
Hyah!

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:51.440
Hyah!

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.040
Hyah!

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.160
Hyah!

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.080
Hyah!

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.560
Stop!

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.960
What a fine time this is.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.320
Since the Emperor took the throne,

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.600
state affairs have been steady.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.680
Winning all hearts under Heaven

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.200
should be within reach soon.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:19.800
Indeed.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.040
The top three exam papers,

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.480
I am very pleased with them.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.800
Tomorrow morning,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.320
the results can be posted.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.120
Right?

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.520
You must feel much relieved,

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:39.800
Lord Rui.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.600
Why do you look so unwell?

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.000
There was a case last night.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.840
An examinee was attacked.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.400
How could that be?

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.760
I memorialized it overnight.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320
But His Majesty’s intent

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.560
is to suppress the news for now,

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.600
and speak once truth is known.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.120
Then you—

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.000
Lord Rui—

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.480
My lords,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.080
if there is nothing further,

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.120
court is dismissed.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.440
We respectfully see Your Majesty off.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.280
Your servant has a matter to report.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.200
Speak.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.960
I impeach Nan Hongyi, Capital Guard Commander,

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.160
for dereliction of duty,

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.360
causing admitted examinees to be attacked

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.760
their lives spared but posts delayed,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.240
leaving offices unfilled

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.040
with far‑reaching impact.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.360
The murder of examinees is a grave matter.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.360
These words

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.720
do you have proof for them?

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.640
On my way to court today,

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.480
I met an examinee who stopped my cart
to beg for help.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.920
He said before the results are posted,

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.400
the examinees around him in the Spring
Imperial Examination

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.200
have been attacked in secret,

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.400
either poisoned and bedridden,

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.400
or ambushed by thugs on night roads.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.800
So he dares not move about alone.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.640
He went to report this to the Guard
Commander.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.080
The Commander told him to wait
at the post station.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.920
He could not sleep all night,

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.000
so at midnight he went out to seek
the Commander.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.400
Yet halfway there he was still attacked
by thugs.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.120
He had nowhere else to turn,

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.760
and to save his own life,

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.440
he could only stop my cart for help.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.960
Have a look, sir.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.280
They’re cheap.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.320
My lord, my lord!

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.640
Please, save me!

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.960
Lately people keep vanishing
from the post station.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.800
Those brought back are all corpses.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.200
Some were poisoned,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.840
some shot through the heart
from behind.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.120
My lord,

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.800
I beg you, you must save me.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.400
I beg you, please.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.600
My lord…

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.520
I was the one who had it suppressed.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:39.680
In this matter,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.680
until the truth is fully uncovered,

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.920
no one may spread the news.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.240
Otherwise the people of the capital

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.800
would be thrown into panic.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.120
Your Majesty is wise.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.360
But I believe

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.200
Nan Hongyi

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.400
has indeed been negligent
in his duties.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.840
The Capital Guard Commander
is so crucial,

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.560
it concerns the people’s safety.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.400
Now examinees are attacked
at the capital’s gates.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.920
Future examinees will fear coming
to the capital,

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.840
and the common folk will live
in constant fear.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.400
This matter is truly of great gravity.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.200
I beseech Your Majesty

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.640
to punish Nan Hongyi
for his negligence.
