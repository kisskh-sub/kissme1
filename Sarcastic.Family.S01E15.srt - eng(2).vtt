00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:29.560
Kiddo,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.199
do you like this song?

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.120
Can you give me the ball back?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.599
Li Li, any plans for the weekend?

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.879
Of course, on weekends,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.120
I have to work overtime.

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.960
That Lao Li,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.479
why does he give you work on weekends?

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:25.120
It's fine.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.120
I'm used to it now.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.240
Weekends should be spent with your kid
and husband.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.000
The three of you together,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.800
all neat and happy.

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.199
Sis, I don't have a kid.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.560
The company will help you with that.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:37.159
Sansan,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.360
Hello, Auntie.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.680
Just call me Sis.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:46.719
Oh, I see.

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:48.479
What about Sunday?

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.719
It's Lao Li and my tenth anniversary.

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.719
We're going to Guangzhou for a concert.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.360
No one to watch the kid.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.120
Isn't that a coincidence?

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.360
It's Meng Meng and my first anniversary.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.280
We're going camping.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.000
It's always so boring.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.879
I really don't want to go.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.240
I'd rather play with Sansan.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.400
You look so happy when you smile.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:12.319
So, how about this—

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.719
I'll leave the kid to you.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.599
Sure.

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:17.279
Thanks, Sis.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.600
You're welcome.

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:20.040
Sansan,

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:21.439
go play with Sis.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.399
She's a teenager now.

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:30.399
You bought so many discs—

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:31.680
can you even watch them all?

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.839
These are all classical music.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.560
Look,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.600
Beethoven,

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:36.439
Chopin,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.439
Secondhand Rose,

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.920
No,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.360
Secondhand Guns N' Roses.

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:41.560
The rest are all originals.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.319
We don't even have a CD drive at home.

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:44.079
Didn't you know?

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:44.839
Of course I know.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.480
A buddy of mine

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.839
got me into overseas shopping.

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:48.680
I'm a professional music purchasing agent now.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.839
You buy foreign discs here,

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:53.079
then sell them abroad.

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.720
Business genius.

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:56.480
You really think I'm dumb?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.839
Who said I sell them abroad?

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.000
I sell them to aliens.

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:01.839
Earth has trade with aliens?

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:02.800
It's been going on for ages.

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:03.639
Chinese movies nowadays

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.879
have long been exported to other planets.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.199
I mean, some movies

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.399
aren't even made for people.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.480
This camping trip—

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.959
how long have we been waiting for it?

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.639
I learned online

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:24.800
how to pitch a tent.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.839
I studied for over a month.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.199
I took notes—three,

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.040
three A4 pages.

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.279
Don't even mention it.

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:32.120
My luggage—

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.879
I packed it a week in advance.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.079
I prepared five dresses.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.600
Well...

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:44.040
Anniversary.

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.279
It doesn't have to be just two people.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.519
The three of us can celebrate.

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.240
I disagree.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:51.240
I second that.

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.800
You may rise.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.480
Hey, look at this.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.160
How about this?

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:58.079
Leave this little one at the pet shop.

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.199
Let my dad watch him for two days.

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.600
Let me show you.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.959
These are the instructions.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:07.920
Sansan.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.120
Allergic to cat fur.

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:11.120
The owner specifically mentioned it.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.720
Not even a trace allowed.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.639
My dad can't do it.

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:17.759
Isn't your mom still an option?

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:19.040
My mom.

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.000
My mom can handle it.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:22.920
That's great.

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.279
But whether he survives tomorrow...

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:26.439
That's not guaranteed.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.839
Where did my mom and dad go?

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.199
Your parents have something to do.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.480
They'll be back in a couple of days.

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:36.680
You're lying.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.000
They went out to have fun.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.120
Went to a concert without me.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.319
No, that's not it...

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:42.040
Listen to me.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.439
Well...

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:43.600
They really have something to do.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.639
Where they're going

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.800
isn't for kids.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.600
Don't cry, don't cry.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.879
Please don't cry.

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:48.360
No.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:48.800
No.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.199
Well...

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.040
They didn't mean to.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.120
How far did you go?

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.680
What are you doing?

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:54.560
Uh, this...

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.680
The kid is homesick.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.519
Cried a bit.

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:57.879
I asked where the kid came from.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.480
My boss's.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.839
Your boss owes you wages?

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.160
How did you know that?

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.439
Sweetie.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.879
Do you know those two?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.800
No.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.480
No.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.920
Well...

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.199
First time meeting them today.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.040
How did you get here?

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:14.360
Right after school,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.199
they put me in the car.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.959
They even called a private car.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.480
Shut up.

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:21.959
Do you want to go with them?

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.879
No.

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.680
They want to lock me in a pet shop.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.560
Don't make things up.

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:27.480
Just kidding.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.279
And they said

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:29.759
I might not

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:32.000
make it to tomorrow.

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:34.279
No.

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.519
Don't say that, kid.

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:36.920
The kid's being very clear.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.680
Hello.

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:38.279
Hello.

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.439
Are you a kidnapper?

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.319
Who's a kidnapper?

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:40.720
What?

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.040
He said you're a kidnapper.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.720
Move aside.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.800
Kidnapper caught at Building Two!

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.480
Wait, wait!

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:45.800
You still want to grab me?

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.199
Let go.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:46.839
Someone help!

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:47.839
Hurry!

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:49.120
They're catching a kidnapper!

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.720
What's going on?

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:58.879
Was there a robbery?

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:04.360
When was he born?

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:08.360
Guess.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.800
Sis.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.160
He's right here.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.279
He's doing fine.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.160
At this time, Sansan

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.440
should be doing homework.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.879
He did.

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.000
I'm watching him do it myself.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.639
Let him move around every half hour.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.480
Okay.

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:39.159
Exercise.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.159
He's up and moving.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.159
He's already active.

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:43.600
It's dry these days.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.200
Make sure he drinks more water.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.759
By the way,

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:47.240
Do you have whole-house water purification?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.240
No.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:48.919
It's fine.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.399
I bought drinks for him after exercise.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.519
Looks like it's here.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.399
It's here.

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:57.159
It's here, it's here.

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:04.759
What's going on?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.360
Who piled all this stuff here?

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.039
Move it yourself.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.399
Sis, everything's arrived.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.000
That's a lot.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.799
They even sent a thermometer gun.

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:16.639
A thermometer gun?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.519
Let me look for the thermometer gun.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.080
Thermometer gun.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.679
Found it, Sis.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.080
Sansan.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.840
Sansan.

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:27.279
Come here.

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:28.120
Let's check, come.

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:31.759
Thirty-six point six degrees.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:32.480
Don't worry, Sis.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.200
Totally normal.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.159
Sansan can't drink cold water.

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:37.639
Water must be room temperature, twenty-five degrees.

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:38.840
Even one degree off isn't okay.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:40.840
Use the thermometer for water.

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:42.200
Alright.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:42.960
Got it, Sis.

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:43.799
Okay.

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:45.960
Move it over.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.000
Bring it inside.

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.039
Let's go.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.320
Me.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960
What's wrong?

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.360
Why so down?

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:02.919
I told you, that's not a legit record.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.919
It's too legit.

00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:04.600
They don't want it.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.279
I'm really puzzled.

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:07.080
Those livestream sellers—

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.279
Isn't it a job anyone can do?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.879
Problem is, you're not just anyone.

00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:12.759
Then aliens aren't reliable either.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.360
People from Planet CA70

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.080
asked me for Earth's best music.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.919
I sent them Beethoven.

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:19.120
I sent Chopin too.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.879
They didn't want any of it.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.120
What else do they want from me?

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.639
Yeah.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.600
That's tough for you.

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:25.519
You can't name a third composer either.

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:28.120
Maybe they don't like Western music?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.200
How about Japanese or Korean?

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.279
I have no idea either.

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:33.679
Just ask them

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:34.600
what they want.

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:35.440
You, you, you—

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.200
Just buy whatever they want.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.000
This morning, a buddy of mine

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.080
sent me a photo.

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:41.559
He said years ago,

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:42.600
they took from Earth

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.279
a master's record to their planet.

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:46.679
They were instantly hooked back then.

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:47.679
That record

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:49.279
became on their planet

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.240
the burning

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.679
SOUL OF MUSIC.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.559
Sounds more like a sales guru

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:56.200
than a music master to me.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:57.840
That guy?

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:01.639
Why does he look so familiar?

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.639
Where have I seen—

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.840
Isn't that Uncle Meng, worn down to the bone?

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:15.279
Quick, ask those people from that planet

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.639
how much they'd pay

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:17.960
for his soul.

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:22.840
Want to know what Santi People look like?

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.159
I do, I do!

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:24.919
What do they look like?

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:26.799
Let me tell you.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.240
Do they have hands?

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.480
Ten claws.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.200
What color is their skin?

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:34.240
Burnt yellow.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.440
Sounds pretty cool.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.720
That's really unexpected.

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:39.120
Do they have eyes?

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.480
They have flesh tendons.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.399
Six of them.

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:42.440
Nice, nice, nice.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.240
Can you stop messing around?

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.360
I'm discussing

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.200
serious cosmic issues with Sis.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.960
I think we should

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.159
focus on basic needs first.

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:54.759
I don't want barbecue.

00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:56.720
Barbecue is high in purines.

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:58.279
Eating too much

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:00.200
raises uric acid levels.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.080
It can cause gout.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.159
Makes sense.

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:05.200
One meal now and then can't be that bad.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.799
Gout pain is level seven.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.200
Doesn't sound too bad.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.799
Childbirth is level ten.

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:13.759
Forget it.

00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:14.759
Let's have hotpot.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.759
Hotpot works.

00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:18.519
Hotpot has even more purines than barbecue.

00:12:18.919 --> 00:12:19.840
Let's pick something else.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:25.919
I know why

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:27.759
your mom won't take you on vacation.

00:12:30.159 --> 00:12:30.440
Fine.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.159
You guys sit.

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:32.720
I'll go make some noodles.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.279
No scallions.

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:35.240
No cilantro.

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:36.480
Extra vinegar, please.

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:38.039
Just like I like it.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.879
Uncle Meng, you're finally back!

00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:48.519
Hurry, hurry!

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:50.120
Nonstop killer calls.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.399
Why did you call me over?

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:52.759
My friend's bar is hosting an event.

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:53.919
They want you to perform there.

00:12:53.919 --> 00:12:54.320
Sit down, quick.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.919
That's great!

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:57.000
I just wrote a song.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.360
For the tea shop owner.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.720
A bunch of grown men

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.200
were moved to tears.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.399
Big Green Tea.

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:03.519
Let me sing it for you.

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:04.759
No, no, no!

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:05.759
It's really unique.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.720
You sang "I Am a Naked Mole Rat," right?

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:21.519
Stop singing, stop!

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:22.720
You're not allowed to perform here.

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:24.039
Hurry up and leave!

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:24.519
Why not?

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:25.200
Why can't I?

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:25.559
Who are you?

00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:26.200
Is this your place?

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:26.679
What are you doing?

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:27.360
Don't touch my mic!

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.440
Give me back my mic!

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.080
Stay back!

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.039
Give me back my mic!

00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:30.960
Give it back! Give it back!

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.320
Lao Meng!

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.279
Give me back my mic!

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:33.080
Let's go, turn around.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.960
Stop arguing here.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.960
Go, stop it, let's go!

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.039
Enough, don't stoop to his level.

00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:36.759
Let's go.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:41.799
Hurry up.

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:42.559
Quick, quick!

00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:43.000
Go, go, go!

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.960
Someone complained.

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:45.480
Go, go, go!

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.279
Seriously.

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:50.360
Can't even sing here.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.240
Exactly.

00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:53.159
Don't let me see you here again!

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:53.960
Go, go, go!

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:51.080
This is our band's very first album.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.320
The four of us made it ourselves.

00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:55.279
We paid for it and pressed it ourselves.

00:14:56.799 --> 00:14:58.200
Because funds were tight,

00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:00.399
we only pressed twenty copies.

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:02.360
Sold.

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.360
And only six copies were sold.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.759
The rest...

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.240
No idea where they ended up.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.120
Why do you insist on hearing that song?

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:15.679
No,

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.360
it's just that was your first song.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.200
It means something.

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:19.559
What meaning does it have?

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.559
No matter what kind of song,

00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:23.360
if no one listens, it means nothing.

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:29.240
Luckily, it's me—

00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:31.039
I'm naturally gifted.

00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:32.360
Anyone else would've

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.399
given up long ago.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.360
Right.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.720
If you had even a shred of pride,

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.039
you wouldn't keep singing.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.600
Go ahead, keep mocking me.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.720
Because I just treat it

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.320
like it's nothing.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:43.960
Uncle Meng,

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.480
my friend's bar is hosting an event.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.519
It's a big deal.

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:47.159
Band performance.

00:15:47.159 --> 00:15:48.000
There's a performance fee.

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:50.480
Yes.

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:52.200
Really?

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:53.039
Yes.

00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:53.799
As long as you go,

00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:54.879
five thousand is negotiable.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.200
Five thousand?

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.519
Wait, I—

00:15:58.519 --> 00:15:59.399
Just to confirm,

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:00.679
is it just singing?

00:16:00.679 --> 00:16:02.039
I can't do anything else.

00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:04.720
I thought five hundred was generous.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.279
Who knew his "five" meant

00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:07.200
five hundred.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:07.960
So...

00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:09.519
Then what did you mean

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.639
by that just now?

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.240
I know the market.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.440
Five free beers will do.

00:16:14.919 --> 00:16:15.960
Darn it.

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:17.879
Five thousand...

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.000
Is rock's spring finally here?

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.679
Are you going?

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.440
I'm going.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.039
I'm going.

00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:26.799
But you promised me five thousand.

00:16:26.799 --> 00:16:27.600
You have to pay me first.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.000
If you stiff me after I sing,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.639
no way.

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:30.559
Also,

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.720
I want five free beers.

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:34.159
I'm used to it.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.639
Performance fee: fifty-five thousand.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.080
Not a cent less.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.000
No problem.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.960
If it's less,

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.600
If the Naked Mole Rat master performs here,

00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:47.200
my Planet CA70 friends will go nuts.

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:48.480
From now on, this place will be

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.919
an interstellar check-in hotspot.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.679
I'm his agent.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.559
If this goes well,

00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:57.519
I can get him to do a residency here.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.639
That price is negotiable.

00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:01.000
Name your terms.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.200
Pleasure working with you.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:03.879
Fill it up!

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.680
That's my shoe.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.680
Beer.

00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:33.359
If you can't hold on, just quit.

00:17:36.119 --> 00:17:37.400
It's only been five minutes.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.559
You haven't even beaten my worst record.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.680
What's your worst record?

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:45.039
Twenty minutes, I guess.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.720
I can last at least an hour.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:56.880
Sis.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.880
I get it now.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.880
Sansan,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.200
your mom said we should take you to the aquarium.

00:18:04.279 --> 00:18:05.240
Go to the aquarium?

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.240
That's too far.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:06.960
I don't want to go.

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:10.799
I know somewhere much closer.

00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:12.880
The pet shop.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.079
That's not the same.

00:18:14.079 --> 00:18:15.400
She wants the aquarium.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.599
What's at the pet shop?

00:18:17.359 --> 00:18:18.079
No ocean.

00:18:18.079 --> 00:18:19.079
But there are sheep.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.960
Lots of little animals.

00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:22.559
I don't like animals.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.720
I don't like aquariums either.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.359
I want to see aliens.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.200
How old are you now?

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.559
Still believe in aliens?

00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:31.519
There are.

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:32.200
There really are.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.480
I'm an alien.

00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:35.920
Let me see.

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:38.759
My name is Sansan.

00:18:38.759 --> 00:18:40.400
Same surname as the Santi People.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.599
I suspect

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:42.839
I'm a Santi Person.

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:47.400
Santi People aren't surnamed "San."

00:18:47.519 --> 00:18:47.960
Besides,

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.640
aliens don't look like you.

00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:52.039
Then what do aliens look like?

00:18:52.039 --> 00:18:53.079
Draw one for me.

00:18:54.039 --> 00:18:55.039
I'll draw one for you.

00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:57.200
Here.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.359
What did you draw?

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.920
Look, you drew her nose

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.039
all crooked.

00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:04.839
What's this?

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.720
Isn't this a bit much?

00:19:08.039 --> 00:19:08.640
This...

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.759
is an alien.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.279
My antenna doesn't look like that.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.759
Mine's round.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:22.920
Let me do it.

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:26.480
This is fun.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.359
It looks about right.

00:19:31.359 --> 00:19:33.079
Since everyone at the concert

00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:35.720
is actually an alien hiding among humans,

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.960
according to Interstellar Law,

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.640
regulations for alien events on Earth

00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:41.440
say humans can't find out

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.640
aliens exist.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.759
So basically,

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.359
Lao Meng can't know he has rabid fans.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.079
So we have three rules.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.359
First,

00:19:59.519 --> 00:20:00.720
when you see Master Meng,

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.920
don't stare at him.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.240
Second,

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.440
no photos allowed.

00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:11.839
Third,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
most importantly,

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:14.680
no screaming or cheering.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.759
I know why you’re all cheering.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Drinks are half price.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
It’s for real.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.799
Guys, drinks are half price.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.920
We’ve got five bottles for free.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.000
Come on, come on.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.240
Drinks are half price.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.160
Alright, alright.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.640
Drinks are half price.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.000
That’s awesome!

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.200
Lao Meng, Lao Meng.

00:20:48.759 --> 00:20:49.759
So I’m working for nothing?

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.240
You, just do your best.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.240
Big Liu said—

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.359
You can drink whatever you want.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.599
You’re heading out?

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:01.000
Got a last-minute client.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.799
A coworker’s sick.

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:02.680
I have to cover for them.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.559
Sorry about that.

00:22:08.079 --> 00:22:09.799
This anniversary—

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.440
—is totally ruined.

00:22:13.359 --> 00:22:14.039
No.

00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:16.480
I think this anniversary is special.

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:20.160
This kid’s kind of interesting.

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:23.119
So you’re really not mad?

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.319
I’m really not mad.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.559
Then come back early.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.960
Alright, I’m off.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.039
Take care out there.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.440
Guys—

00:22:50.759 --> 00:22:51.559
Do you think later—

00:22:51.559 --> 00:22:53.000
—will they kick us out?

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.119
No way, no way.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:54.720
I checked.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.400
No one’s holding—

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.880
—eggs or lettuce or anything.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.319
Nope.

00:22:57.319 --> 00:22:58.079
Exactly.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.200
It’s fine.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.640
At our age—

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:01.880
If anyone dares kick me out—

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.599
I’ll collapse right in front of them.

00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:04.079
Right.

00:23:04.079 --> 00:23:04.960
It won’t happen, it won’t.

00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:12.920
I really admire you.

00:23:13.839 --> 00:23:14.559
What are you doing?

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:15.880
What kind of bar is this?

00:23:16.839 --> 00:23:18.000
I’m so happy.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.559
Peanuts are half price today too.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.400
Peanuts are half price.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.279
Half price, half price.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.240
But it’s not that—

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.440
—not worth getting this excited.

00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:24.440
Peanuts half price.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.480
Is that worth celebrating?

00:23:25.519 --> 00:23:26.400
Exactly.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.599
It’s wild.

00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:29.240
I think tonight’s crowd—

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.039
—is a little weird.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.119
But we—

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:31.720
—we just ignore them.

00:23:32.359 --> 00:23:33.359
Let’s just do our thing, that’s right.

00:23:33.359 --> 00:23:34.079
Don’t let it get to you.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:34.519
Come on.

00:23:34.519 --> 00:23:34.880
Let’s get pumped.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.319
Alright.

00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:36.079
Come on.

00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:37.039
One.

00:23:37.039 --> 00:23:37.440
Two.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.480
One, two, three.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.920
Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.240
Go!

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:40.720
Let’s move.

00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:43.640
Can we be a bit more in sync?

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:44.920
Let’s go!

00:23:45.119 --> 00:23:45.599
Go!

00:23:45.839 --> 00:23:46.319
Alright, let’s go.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.319
Gentlemen, sirs—

00:23:57.599 --> 00:24:00.519
Please welcome the Naked Mole Rat Band!

00:24:22.119 --> 00:24:23.880
Let me tune up first.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.359
Hope nothing goes wrong.

00:24:33.359 --> 00:24:34.720
Or my license—

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.839
—will get revoked by the Interstellar Alliance.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.640
It’s fine.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.000
Li Cai’s watching.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.000
Sis—

00:24:56.079 --> 00:24:56.920
Bet you didn’t expect this.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.880
Uncle Meng is a rock star from another planet.

00:24:59.039 --> 00:24:59.920
Auntie Cai and I are at the bar—

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.799
—hosting a concert.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.079
The whole audience is aliens.

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:03.000
Come join us!

00:25:04.079 --> 00:25:05.079
This kid—

00:25:05.759 --> 00:25:06.759
—just makes stuff up.

00:25:13.319 --> 00:25:14.640
Why are you awake?

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.000
School’s tomorrow.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.720
I don’t want to go.

00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:25.279
Do you want to see aliens?

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.960
What are you doing?

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.839
Watching the show.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.759
Ever seen a show before?

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.039
It’s so quiet.

00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:36.880
Get hyped!

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.680
We’re not allowed to.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.240
There’s a rule—no hyping.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:39.880
A rule?

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.440
Bullshit, you made that up.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.680
Just get hyped!

00:25:48.279 --> 00:25:49.000
First—

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.759
—we’ll play a song for you.

00:25:51.079 --> 00:25:52.680
Our hit single—

00:25:53.119 --> 00:25:54.720
“I Am a Naked Mole Rat.”

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.720
First time singing in front of so many.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.160
Please be kind.

00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:02.960
What are you doing?

00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:04.400
I can’t hold back anymore.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.759
I’m about to explode.

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:07.400
Boom!

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.480
Let’s blow up the whole place!

00:26:09.519 --> 00:26:10.440
Li Cai—

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.160
Yeah.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.920
You get hyped.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.799
You have to hype up too.

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:13.720
You’re the only one not hyped.

00:26:14.599 --> 00:26:15.680
You loser.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.440
Darn it, I can’t hold back.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.200
I declare—

00:26:22.119 --> 00:26:23.160
Burgers are half price!

00:26:23.319 --> 00:26:24.440
Fries are half price!

00:26:24.839 --> 00:26:25.759
Power banks half price!

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.960
Smashed cucumbers half price!

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:27.839
Everyone—

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.079
Let’s get hyped!

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.880
I love you.

00:27:00.279 --> 00:27:01.119
Just watching like this?

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:02.119
Get hyped!

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:04.799
Hype up!

00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:07.920
I declare—

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.119
Everyone gets a free fried chicken!

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.400
You’re paying for this, right?

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.799
Only one per person, no extras.

00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:38.720
Uncle Meng is awesome!

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.480
Whoever finds the actor’s clothes—

00:27:47.759 --> 00:27:49.480
Unlimited beer!

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:55.799
Digging tunnels, retreating into darkness.

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:57.480
Fight the darkness with rage.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.480
Order some fruit.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.480
DELIVER EGGS

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.400
USE PAIN TO TELL FRIENDS APART

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.319
ORDER PASTA

00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:03.240
DELIVER BRAISED PORK RICE

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:05.640
USE MUSIC TO FIND MENG QIANWAN

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.720
TOP UP ONE THOUSAND

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.039
SEND TEN THOUSAND

00:28:14.119 --> 00:28:15.680
LONG LIVE NAKED MOLE RAT

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.480
LONG LIVE ROCK MUSIC

00:28:17.519 --> 00:28:19.039
LONG LIVE ALIENS

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.880
CAN'T SAY "ALIENS" HERE

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.319
Is this kid crazy?

00:28:22.319 --> 00:28:23.599
Long live naked mole rat.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.559
Long live rock music.

00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:27.640
Long live aliens.

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:28.240
Li Cai

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.319
Long live aliens.

00:28:29.319 --> 00:28:30.119
Li Cai, Li Cai

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.440
Long live aliens.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:36.880
Horn

00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:37.880
Horn

00:28:50.839 --> 00:28:51.599
Let me through.

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:22.759
So cool.

00:29:22.759 --> 00:29:23.880
I really like him.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.079
I finally saw him.

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:27.960
So cool.

00:29:28.319 --> 00:29:29.480
Alien

00:29:29.759 --> 00:29:30.400
Where? Where?

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.200
Sis, did you see him?

00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:32.400
Finally saw him.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.440
So cool.

00:29:33.759 --> 00:29:34.680
Isn't it amazing?

00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:37.720
What's so surprising?

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.559
Me too.

00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:42.519
You broke Interstellar Alliance rules.

00:29:42.519 --> 00:29:43.640
I can report you.

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:45.640
They're all aliens.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.079
Can you report them all?

00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:48.200
Me.

00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:49.160
This, me.

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:51.920
That's pretty impressive.

00:29:52.319 --> 00:29:53.079
Sis

00:29:54.599 --> 00:29:56.599
Is he from Santi Planet?

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.200
Him?

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.519
Definitely not.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.599
He's way cooler than Santi People.

00:30:05.519 --> 00:30:06.400
Meng Qianwan

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:07.319
Meng Qianwan

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.200
Cai Yi

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.480
Someone hit me just now.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.240
Did you see it?

00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:16.519
No, I didn't.

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:19.279
Don't let me catch her.

00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:21.079
Uh...

00:30:21.079 --> 00:30:21.680
Stop looking.

00:30:21.839 --> 00:30:23.240
Listen, this song is awful.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.039
It's great!

00:30:24.119 --> 00:30:24.559
Come on.

00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:25.359
Let's get hyped!

00:30:27.319 --> 00:30:28.480
Wait a sec, Cai Yi.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.640
Should we go enforce discipline?

00:30:31.039 --> 00:30:32.559
I see the horns showing.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.480
Don't go, they're all drunk on stage.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.039
It's just my old eyes, can't see clearly.

00:30:37.079 --> 00:30:44.119
Meng Qianwan, Meng Qianwan, Meng Qianwan

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.640
Long live rock.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:36.279
Meng Qianwan, Meng Qianwan, Meng Qianwan

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.519
The show was a big success.

00:32:58.519 --> 00:32:59.839
You.

00:33:00.319 --> 00:33:01.480
Fat sea for the rest of your life.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.720
I'll cover it all.

00:33:06.319 --> 00:33:07.559
All these audience members...

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.000
Probably shills.

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:12.039
How do you know?

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.599
No one cares about us.

00:33:14.599 --> 00:33:16.119
No one's heard our songs.

00:33:17.319 --> 00:33:18.440
Invited so many.

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:19.880
You spent a lot, right?

00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:21.519
They all acted so into it.

00:33:24.319 --> 00:33:25.000
Yeah.

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:26.279
Yeah.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.359
All shills.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.240
Even if they're shills, I'm happy.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.559
All these years...

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:38.319
Having a night like this...

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:40.319
Feels so satisfying.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.400
I even cried.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.599
In a blink,

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:48.960
Over twenty years have passed.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:50.799
Guys,

00:33:52.079 --> 00:33:52.799
Uh...

00:33:54.079 --> 00:33:55.720
Tonight we had a beautiful dream.

00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:57.519
A passionate, thrilling dream.

00:33:57.519 --> 00:33:58.319
Let me say something.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.559
Let's all together...

00:34:00.519 --> 00:34:01.759
Toast to my co-in-law.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.319
Yeah.

00:34:03.319 --> 00:34:03.839
Come on.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.640
Bottoms up!

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:05.880
We drank.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.480
You do as you like.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:07.519
Come on.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:22.480
Guys,

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:24.599
With tonight's dream,

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.000
Our passion can burn for ten more years.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.880
The future looks bright.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:30.719
Sweet dreams.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:31.239
Me, me, me...

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:32.199
Let me find my jacket.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.159
Lost my jacket.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.800
I danced my meds away.

00:34:35.039 --> 00:34:36.159
My blood pressure's up.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.519
Drank a bit too much tonight.

00:35:25.559 --> 00:35:26.840
You all came too.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.760
Mom texted me.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.920
I rushed right over.

00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:32.239
How is it, am I late?

00:35:32.519 --> 00:35:32.920
Good.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.280
You came at the perfect time.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.360
The show just ended.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.360
Just in time to take us home.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.320
You rascal.

00:35:37.559 --> 00:35:38.320
How was the performance?

00:35:38.519 --> 00:35:39.239
Not bad.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.719
The crowd looked better.

00:35:40.719 --> 00:35:41.239
Right?

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:41.880
Me.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.119
I'm about to cry.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.000
It's okay, Dad.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.960
I'll try harder next time.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.000
Let's go.

00:35:46.239 --> 00:35:47.360
I'll sing for you at home.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.000
Sing it once.

00:35:48.039 --> 00:35:49.079
You should rest now.

00:36:05.559 --> 00:36:06.760
Why aren't you sleeping?

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.599
Watching the stars.

00:36:11.239 --> 00:36:12.119
Then I'll watch with you.

00:36:16.519 --> 00:36:17.480
I think...

00:36:17.559 --> 00:36:19.800
You really like taking care of kids.

00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:21.039
Really?

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.880
I've been pretty happy these days.

00:36:27.679 --> 00:36:28.400
How about you?

00:36:28.679 --> 00:36:29.840
You and Sansan together...

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.639
Are you happy?

00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:34.199
Pretty happy.

00:36:36.599 --> 00:36:37.440
That's good then.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.400
You're definitely a good dad.

00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:46.719
Wait a second.

00:36:49.079 --> 00:36:50.360
Do you have some news

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.239
to tell me?

00:36:52.519 --> 00:36:53.199
Nope.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.199
Why are you rubbing your stomach?

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.119
It's the free fried chicken.

00:37:00.119 --> 00:37:01.039
And the half-price pizza.

00:37:01.039 --> 00:37:01.960
Did you eat too much?

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:04.559
You scared me!

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:08.760
What do you mean?

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.639
I mean,

00:37:15.159 --> 00:37:16.039
the two of us

00:37:16.039 --> 00:37:18.400
still need time to grow.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.559
That's true.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.239
Trying to dodge the bill?

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.719
That five thousand for Lao Meng,

00:37:30.719 --> 00:37:31.639
I paid it all up front.

00:37:31.639 --> 00:37:32.800
No, who's dodging the bill?

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.519
Your money covered your own tab.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.440
What tab do I have?

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.000
You treated everyone yesterday.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.880
Half-price fried chicken.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.880
Half-price burgers.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.760
Half-price fruit platters.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.719
Half-price power banks.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.679
I didn't even get several of those power banks.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.679
And all those buy one,

00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:46.119
get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven free.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.000
You, you yourself—

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:47.679
Just look for yourself.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.159
I did this

00:37:49.559 --> 00:37:51.880
to cover up the alien's identity.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:52.719
I—I—

00:37:52.719 --> 00:37:54.400
for world peace.

00:37:54.519 --> 00:37:55.760
So you do good deeds,

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.159
but I have to pay for it?

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.800
Besides, I gave you discounts.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.760
Otherwise, even fifty-five thousand

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.519
wouldn't be enough.

00:38:01.719 --> 00:38:02.480
You're something.

00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:03.519
You're something.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.800
Let me tell you,

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.320
you'll never get

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.679
to host Lao Meng's concert.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.280
I'll open a bar across the street.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.360
I'll open a bar too.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.199
I'll have Lao Meng sing at my place every day.

00:38:12.199 --> 00:38:14.079
You won't sell a single fry here.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:14.960
Li Cai.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.360
Come work as a waiter for me.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.679
Uncle Meng can't sing anymore.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.079
Why?

00:38:20.639 --> 00:38:22.199
Last night, things got out of hand.

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:22.920
Today, on the black market,

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.960
people are selling his autograph.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.599
This was

00:38:24.599 --> 00:38:26.199
strictly forbidden by the Interstellar Inspectorate.

00:38:26.239 --> 00:38:27.360
So Uncle Meng got penalized.

00:38:28.719 --> 00:38:29.559
How was he punished?

00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:30.679
Universal ban.

00:38:30.719 --> 00:38:31.320
Universal.

00:38:36.639 --> 00:38:37.199
That's huge.

00:38:37.199 --> 00:38:38.199
Why didn't you tell me?

00:38:39.039 --> 00:38:39.440
Such a big deal,

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.239
how do you not know?

00:38:41.639 --> 00:38:42.440
Kid,

00:38:45.199 --> 00:38:46.000
we failed.

00:38:50.239 --> 00:38:51.199
Who's paying for this?

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.119
Who's footing the bill?

00:38:59.039 --> 00:39:00.000
Music.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.079
I think

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.119
music is

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:04.119
able to

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.760
break down barriers,

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.920
cross races,

00:39:07.039 --> 00:39:08.000
bring people from all over the world

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.800
together—it's an art.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.599
It's the greatest invention

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:13.000
in human history.

00:39:13.159 --> 00:39:14.039
It can

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.440
end wars,

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.320
spread true love,

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320
bring hope.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.199
Why did I keep going?

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.920
I think all along,

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.039
it's been thanks to

00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:25.239
my own talent.

00:39:25.559 --> 00:39:26.880
My talent is

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.199
a good mindset.

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:29.639
Otherwise, our band would've split ages ago.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.559
Dreams.

00:39:30.559 --> 00:39:32.079
My dream, of course, is

00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:34.159
for my music to reach the world,

00:39:34.159 --> 00:39:35.199
for everyone to hear it,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.320
and then

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.360
spread true love,

00:39:38.559 --> 00:39:39.800
and find kindred spirits.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.199
Especially those under fifty,

00:39:41.199 --> 00:39:42.320
under fifty years old,

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.519
over 1.65 meters tall,

00:39:43.559 --> 00:39:44.159
healthy,

00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:45.280
no bad habits,

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.000
divorced or widowed,

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:49.519
single women.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.639
All are welcome.
