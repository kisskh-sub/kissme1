The Manipulated

00:00:42.356 --> 00:00:44.191
What?

00:00:44.274 --> 00:00:46.026
-Call it off?
-Yeah.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.945
Well, Park Taejoong
hasn't been caught yet, so I'm sure--

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:50.030
Hello?

00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:53.450
Yeah, I'll mobilize the team now.

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.951
Shit.

00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:57.537
-It's been a blast, but we're done.
-Hang on a sec.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.125
Why are they terminating this? Huh?

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:04.378
Guys like us
are only supposed to follow orders.

00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:06.838
-What does it matter?
-That's not good enough for me.

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:08.340
You want to know that badly?

00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:09.549
Yeah.

00:01:11.093 --> 00:01:12.302
All right, then. Hop in.

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:20.060
Your car is ready, sir.

00:01:20.143 --> 00:01:21.770
Thanks. Appreciate your help.

00:01:21.853 --> 00:01:22.938
-Take care.
-Bye.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.862
Taejoong and I agreed to meet up in Seoul.

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:33.990
Maybe we should have gone there together.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.702
Listen, I think
you should stay here and...

00:01:49.548 --> 00:01:51.633
-Wait, what's going on?
-You're under arrest.

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:53.593
What are you doing? Wait!

00:01:54.177 --> 00:01:56.179
-Hey! What are you doing?
-Stay still.

00:01:56.263 --> 00:01:57.389
Stop moving!

00:01:57.472 --> 00:01:58.557
Wait! Let me go!

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.808
Move in! Come on.

00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:01.226
You can't do this!

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:02.686
Enough!

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.604
This has to be illegal!

00:02:04.688 --> 00:02:05.772
What a fucking brat.

00:02:06.898 --> 00:02:08.233
Noh Yongsik.

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:11.862
You're under arrest as a suspect
in the recent murder of Assemblyman Baek.

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:14.573
-All right, guys.
-But you're making a mistake!

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:16.700
I don't know what you're talking about!

00:02:16.783 --> 00:02:19.661
You have the right to remain silent,
and to an attorney.

00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:22.831
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:24.708
He didn't do anything wrong!

00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:26.877
Get the fuck off of me. Detective!

00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:30.130
Papa! My dad is innocent!

00:02:31.798 --> 00:02:33.258
Papa!

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:39.890
Let's go, let's go! Let's go!

00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:42.100
- Get out of the way!
- Mr. Noh!

00:02:42.184 --> 00:02:43.935
Mr. Noh! Do you have anything to say?

00:02:46.813 --> 00:02:50.358
The suspect, Mr. Noh,
who murdered Assemblyman Baek Sangman,

00:02:50.442 --> 00:02:53.195
has finally been caught
after a long pursuit.

00:02:53.278 --> 00:02:56.448
He was recently released
after serving a 20-year sentence

00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:57.866
for the murder of his wife.

00:02:58.617 --> 00:03:01.745
Investigations revealed
that shortly after his release,

00:03:01.828 --> 00:03:05.665
he began sending threatening letters
and demanding money from the assemblyman.

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:08.210
Furthermore, given that the perpetrator

00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:11.087
killed a sitting member
of the National Assembly,

00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:13.465
the police are focusing
their investigation

00:03:13.548 --> 00:03:15.759
on whether there were any accomplices.

00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:20.222
The Manipulated

00:03:22.724 --> 00:03:23.975
That's all we need.

00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:27.812
So why'd you do it?

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.900
I thought I was innocent
until proven guilty.

00:03:32.442 --> 00:03:36.029
You're labeling me as a murderer
when I don't even know what's going on.

00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:38.073
I swear you have the wrong person.

00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:40.325
But didn't you send letters
to the assemblyman

00:03:40.408 --> 00:03:42.452
asking for money
and threatening to kill him?

00:03:42.536 --> 00:03:44.704
That wasn't me sending all those letters.

00:03:44.788 --> 00:03:47.624
I promise
I'm telling you the truth, Detective.

00:03:47.707 --> 00:03:49.042
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:50.794
I don't care, I have to get inside.

00:03:50.877 --> 00:03:53.004
-Please calm down.
-Get out of my way!

00:03:53.088 --> 00:03:56.049
He's being interrogated right now,
so we can't let you in.

00:03:57.425 --> 00:03:59.135
What's the real reason I can't?

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.346
Don't you know I'm his daughter?

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:03.848
-What the fuck are you doing to him?
-Stay calm.

00:04:03.932 --> 00:04:05.225
Move out of my way!

00:04:05.308 --> 00:04:06.518
-Let me in there!
-Stop!

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.604
Ring any bells?

00:04:10.063 --> 00:04:11.231
Seriously?

00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:13.191
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:15.360
It's the first time
I've ever seen this place.

00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:16.695
I don't know where this is.

00:04:16.778 --> 00:04:19.531
So how would I be able
to send those letters there?

00:04:20.782 --> 00:04:23.994
In the latest development
of the murder of Assemblyman Baek,

00:04:24.077 --> 00:04:26.830
the papers used in the letters,
along with the victim's DNA,

00:04:26.913 --> 00:04:28.582
were found in the suspect's home.

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:31.334
Due to these findings,
police are investigating this crime

00:04:31.418 --> 00:04:32.627
as premeditated murder.

00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:36.756
PROBABILITY OF BEING THE SAME INDIVIDUAL
99.9993%

00:04:37.632 --> 00:04:41.052
So you're saying the victim's DNA
was found in my house?

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:42.137
Yes.

00:04:43.597 --> 00:04:44.681
DNA MATCH REPORT

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:47.642
And also that my DNA was found
at the crime scene as well?

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:56.443
I can't believe they went into my house.

00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:03.742
Eunbi.

00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:06.369
I don't think I can help you.

00:05:06.453 --> 00:05:07.746
What? You're leaving?

00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:10.707
If you get appointed another lawyer,

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.044
maybe you should consider
that honesty is the best policy.

00:05:14.127 --> 00:05:15.253
Wait. No.

00:05:16.671 --> 00:05:17.923
Sir, my daughter is...

00:05:19.674 --> 00:05:21.384
Eunbi is in danger.

00:05:21.468 --> 00:05:22.469
What do I do?

00:05:23.303 --> 00:05:24.763
-Time to go.
-Please, officers.

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:26.556
I've to get to my daughter right now.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.100
-She's not safe at home by herself.
-Okay.

00:05:29.184 --> 00:05:30.352
I have to protect her.

00:05:30.435 --> 00:05:32.354
-Stay calm, sir.
-Don't you understand?

00:05:32.437 --> 00:05:33.939
-Hey!
-I have to get to her!

00:05:34.022 --> 00:05:35.231
Eunbi!

00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:36.733
Hold him down.

00:05:36.816 --> 00:05:39.069
Don't you understand
what kind of danger she's in?

00:05:48.078 --> 00:05:49.079
Here.

00:05:51.915 --> 00:05:54.000
Why are we moving so fast on this case?

00:05:54.084 --> 00:05:57.045
It's open and shut,
so we might as well wrap it up quickly.

00:05:58.213 --> 00:06:00.590
-Are you bringing in the daughter?
-Of course we are.

00:06:00.674 --> 00:06:03.718
We found evidence that she received
a cut of the criminal proceeds.

00:06:03.802 --> 00:06:04.886
They're in it together.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.180
My daughter had nothing to do
with any of this!

00:06:07.263 --> 00:06:09.724
-Oh. Scared me.
-If you dare lay even a finger on her,

00:06:09.808 --> 00:06:12.602
I swear, I'll make all of you pay for it.
Got it?

00:06:12.686 --> 00:06:14.604
- Shit.
- That's funny.

00:06:14.688 --> 00:06:16.314
-You'll make me pay?
-Hey, come on.

00:06:16.398 --> 00:06:17.399
Back off.

00:06:18.274 --> 00:06:20.944
-Was that a threat?
-Hey, listen, I'm sorry.

00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:24.572
Just leave my daughter out of this.
I'll do anything.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.700
I'm begging you.

00:06:26.783 --> 00:06:29.869
Then confess.
We already have all the evidence.

00:06:30.787 --> 00:06:32.831
We're both innocent.

00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:35.750
Forget it. We'll get our answers
after we interrogate her.

00:06:35.834 --> 00:06:38.670
Hey! If you do anything to hurt her,

00:06:38.753 --> 00:06:41.381
I'll kill every single one
of you assholes!

00:06:41.464 --> 00:06:43.383
You fucking hear me?

00:06:43.466 --> 00:06:44.926
Eunbi is innocent!

00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:48.304
I need a smoke.

00:06:50.015 --> 00:06:51.933
Hey. Hey!

00:06:55.395 --> 00:06:58.398
Eunbi. Eunbi.

00:07:02.235 --> 00:07:03.611
GET LOST MURDERER
GO TO HELL

00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:07.949
Eunbi.

00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:09.576
Eunbi!

00:07:10.493 --> 00:07:12.287
Are you here?

00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:26.259
Shit.

00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:53.161
Bastard!

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:48.258
We truly got blindsided with all this.

00:08:49.008 --> 00:08:50.468
This isn't your dad's fault.

00:08:51.553 --> 00:08:53.138
You know that, right?

00:08:54.222 --> 00:08:55.306
What does it matter?

00:08:56.057 --> 00:08:58.101
No one will believe what we have to say.

00:08:58.184 --> 00:08:59.853
They already decided he's guilty.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.399
Everybody else might believe those lies.
But you... We know the truth.

00:09:05.608 --> 00:09:06.693
What good is that?

00:09:07.652 --> 00:09:09.654
Why is he taking the blame for all this?

00:09:10.572 --> 00:09:12.115
Why be such an idiot?

00:09:12.907 --> 00:09:14.534
Can't he fight back for once?

00:09:14.617 --> 00:09:16.327
It's like he doesn't even try!

00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:23.376
What am I supposed to do?

00:09:26.963 --> 00:09:28.756
What if my dad goes back to prison?

00:09:29.382 --> 00:09:30.758
I can't do this again.

00:09:33.887 --> 00:09:38.183
Listen, this all happened
because of me, so...

00:09:38.266 --> 00:09:39.267
I'll fix it.

00:09:42.228 --> 00:09:43.855
I'll figure something out, okay?

00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:49.360
What are you gonna do?

00:09:49.444 --> 00:09:50.612
No, wait.

00:09:50.695 --> 00:09:51.905
Where are you going?

00:09:52.488 --> 00:09:54.532
You can't leave!

00:10:20.225 --> 00:10:22.060
Congratulations, Young Master.

00:10:25.563 --> 00:10:27.398
Your 100th sculpture.

00:10:29.234 --> 00:10:30.401
And how do you know that?

00:10:32.695 --> 00:10:34.155
Because I've been keeping track.

00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:37.283
For this auction,
what about holding a special exhibition?

00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:39.786
That would be the perfect chance
to reveal yourself.

00:10:39.869 --> 00:10:40.870
And why should I?

00:10:40.954 --> 00:10:44.666
Arleli's genius as an artist
deserves to be praised properly.

00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:47.919
So, the world should know
his true identity.

00:10:48.586 --> 00:10:51.130
The name of the greatest artist
to ever live.

00:10:51.756 --> 00:10:55.218
An Yohan.

00:10:56.719 --> 00:10:57.804
You're right.

00:10:58.388 --> 00:11:00.223
It's time to step out of the shadows.

00:11:01.641 --> 00:11:05.186
And when this sculpture goes to auction,
I will outbid everyone.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:06.771
You'll buy it?

00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:14.195
No one would appreciate it as much as me.

00:11:14.904 --> 00:11:17.031
I understand the true value of your work.

00:11:17.699 --> 00:11:20.201
I would never give up
this beautiful sculpture.

00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:22.495
When I die, I want it buried with me.

00:11:23.997 --> 00:11:26.040
Do you know why I like to hold auctions?

00:11:28.793 --> 00:11:32.422
I love to watch them panic.
I just can't get enough of it.

00:11:33.589 --> 00:11:35.216
Seeing their desperate little faces

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.094
when they realize their fate
is in someone else's hands.

00:11:42.307 --> 00:11:46.644
And as their bids climb higher and higher,
they start begging for their lives.

00:11:48.396 --> 00:11:50.982
Nothing else compares to it.

00:12:08.124 --> 00:12:10.084
I thought you'd call me sooner.

00:12:11.252 --> 00:12:12.337
Why him?

00:12:13.838 --> 00:12:16.549
Why are you doing this?
I'm the one you want, aren't I?

00:12:17.175 --> 00:12:18.509
I did what I had to.

00:12:18.593 --> 00:12:20.470
I needed to get your attention somehow.

00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:29.312
Let's keep innocent people
out of this, okay?

00:12:30.605 --> 00:12:33.441
-Why don't we meet and we can settle this?
-Look at that.

00:12:33.524 --> 00:12:36.319
I knew doing that
would force you to reach out.

00:12:36.402 --> 00:12:38.446
-So now what?
-If you had called sooner,

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:40.323
your friend could have been spared.

00:12:41.199 --> 00:12:43.701
He shouldn't be the one to suffer.
Don't you agree?

00:12:44.243 --> 00:12:47.038
So what is it you want from me,
you fucking psycho?

00:12:47.121 --> 00:12:49.374
All of this happened
because of your actions,

00:12:49.457 --> 00:12:51.834
so I'll give you the chance to fix it.

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:09.644
Open the box in front of you.

00:13:21.656 --> 00:13:24.283
That's the knife
that killed Assemblyman Baek.

00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:27.495
You can take it, turn yourself in
and go back to prison

00:13:27.578 --> 00:13:30.540
or write down the amount
you want on a blank check there.

00:13:45.721 --> 00:13:48.516
I sincerely hope you make
the right choice and join me.

00:13:48.599 --> 00:13:50.643
I'm trying to make this as easy
as possible,

00:13:51.227 --> 00:13:52.520
but it's up to you.

00:13:53.271 --> 00:13:54.939
The knife in your possession,

00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:56.649
whose life will it end?

00:13:59.944 --> 00:14:01.779
First, let me ask you something.

00:14:02.738 --> 00:14:05.074
What's the reason that you're doing this?

00:14:06.742 --> 00:14:07.952
Why do you take people--

00:14:08.035 --> 00:14:10.204
And sculpt them to look like murderers?

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.583
That's easy.

00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:15.668
It's because they were convenient to use.

00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:17.962
They happened to be
where I needed them to be.

00:14:18.045 --> 00:14:20.464
I like to think of it
as collateral damage.

00:14:20.548 --> 00:14:22.800
Unfortunate but inevitable.

00:14:22.884 --> 00:14:26.262
When people walk around,
sometimes they end up stepping on ants.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.515
But do they ever feel
the need to apologize?

00:14:29.599 --> 00:14:31.684
-Of course not.
-What's your point?

00:14:31.767 --> 00:14:33.186
It's a simple observation.

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:35.605
I've also noticed something
pretty interesting.

00:14:35.688 --> 00:14:37.148
I think before people die,

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:40.902
they stop fighting the inevitable
and accept fate.

00:14:42.195 --> 00:14:45.489
I have a feeling Noh Yongsik
will prove me right today.

00:14:45.573 --> 00:14:46.782
I get it. You win.

00:14:48.826 --> 00:14:50.786
I already won this a while ago.

00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:54.123
All I'm doing now
is cleaning up your mess.

00:14:54.207 --> 00:14:57.668
I'm really doing you a favor,
so you should be saying thanks.

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:06.010
Hello?

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.479
Why can't he understand
when I'm being so clear?

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.443
Why does everyone
make things so hard? Huh?

00:15:40.711 --> 00:15:42.255
Eunbi.

00:15:42.922 --> 00:15:44.006
Papa!

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.260
That's my little girl.

00:15:47.343 --> 00:15:49.679
Watch your step when you run, sweetheart.

00:15:49.762 --> 00:15:51.889
Can you find me a four-leaf clover, Daddy?

00:15:51.973 --> 00:15:54.308
Of course, darling.
Let's go find one together.

00:15:54.392 --> 00:15:55.851
I think I know where they are.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.856
We'll make sure to find you
the best four-leaf clover.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:01.983
Do you see any?

00:16:06.904 --> 00:16:08.614
- Papa!
- Eunbi.

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:11.200
Ta-da!

00:16:11.284 --> 00:16:12.702
Guess how many awards I got?

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.580
What's with all those scratches on you?

00:16:17.581 --> 00:16:18.749
Did you get in a fight?

00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:20.960
I didn't start it.

00:16:21.043 --> 00:16:23.921
The other kids at school
kept saying you were a loser.

00:16:24.714 --> 00:16:27.008
Even if they did,
you should've walked away.

00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:29.885
I tried to,
but they wouldn't leave me alone.

00:16:31.429 --> 00:16:32.513
Listen, Eunbi.

00:16:33.306 --> 00:16:34.974
Put that down for a second.

00:16:35.057 --> 00:16:37.226
I have to explain
something important, okay?

00:16:38.686 --> 00:16:42.023
For me to work hard in here
and earn as much as I can for us,

00:16:42.106 --> 00:16:44.150
I need to focus on making money,

00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:47.028
which means I won't have
a lot of time to see you.

00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:48.904
So you shouldn't visit me anymore.

00:16:49.947 --> 00:16:50.990
Why?

00:16:51.073 --> 00:16:54.702
For now, it would be best
if you forget that I exist.

00:16:54.785 --> 00:16:58.289
Okay? And if anyone asks,
don't tell them I'm your father.

00:16:58.372 --> 00:17:00.708
Those people will make fun of you
if you do.

00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:03.044
Well, you can go and tell them off,
can't you?

00:17:09.884 --> 00:17:10.885
You know what?

00:17:12.136 --> 00:17:13.596
I'm not your papa anymore.

00:17:14.096 --> 00:17:15.097
Papa...

00:17:15.181 --> 00:17:16.932
Don't call me that, okay?

00:17:17.016 --> 00:17:19.310
From now on, you don't have a dad.

00:17:19.393 --> 00:17:20.978
We don't know each other, got it?

00:17:21.562 --> 00:17:22.772
Go.

00:17:22.855 --> 00:17:24.106
And don't ever come back.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.442
Papa! Papa, don't leave me!

00:17:28.152 --> 00:17:29.278
Papa!

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.785
ELECTRONICS REPAIR SHOP

00:17:45.795 --> 00:17:46.796
Eunbi.

00:17:54.387 --> 00:17:56.222
I thought we didn't know each other.

00:18:04.146 --> 00:18:05.439
You have nowhere to go?

00:18:06.065 --> 00:18:08.067
Oh. It's just...

00:18:08.984 --> 00:18:09.985
Whatever.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.238
I guess this place is yours.

00:18:12.321 --> 00:18:14.073
I've been wanting to leave anyways.

00:18:15.408 --> 00:18:16.867
Wait, Eunbi. Hold on.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.829
You stay here at the store.
I'll find somewhere else.

00:18:19.912 --> 00:18:21.372
I'll go, okay?

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.333
Sorry.

00:18:28.754 --> 00:18:31.090
Shit.

00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:41.267
Are you deaf? I said I'm leaving,
so don't just walk away.

00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:43.477
I... I'm sorry, sweetheart.

00:18:47.523 --> 00:18:48.607
So...

00:18:50.693 --> 00:18:51.944
You have to pay the rent.

00:18:52.027 --> 00:18:54.155
Make sure you have the money every month.

00:18:54.238 --> 00:18:55.906
Enough for utilities too.

00:18:57.867 --> 00:18:58.909
What? Don't like it?

00:18:58.993 --> 00:19:01.412
Uh, no, that all sounds really good.

00:19:01.495 --> 00:19:03.956
This is your house now,
so I should pay you rent.

00:19:05.124 --> 00:19:08.252
Actually, I've been itching to work again,

00:19:08.335 --> 00:19:11.756
so paying rent won't be an issue,
even if it's not for rent--

00:19:19.013 --> 00:19:21.265
Eunbi, why are you
so mean to your dad?

00:19:21.348 --> 00:19:24.393
You always said how much you missed him
while he was in prison.

00:19:24.477 --> 00:19:26.604
I don't know why I'm like this.

00:19:26.687 --> 00:19:27.855
After seeing him again,

00:19:29.148 --> 00:19:31.400
all I felt was anger and frustration.

00:19:32.651 --> 00:19:34.570
That's because you love him, you know.

00:19:34.653 --> 00:19:36.113
No, it's not.

00:19:36.822 --> 00:19:39.492
Well, I like him.
Even if he's a little weird.

00:19:39.575 --> 00:19:41.535
Like, why does he hide his money?

00:19:41.619 --> 00:19:42.745
I know, right?

00:19:42.828 --> 00:19:44.872
Trust me, I don't understand it either.

00:19:44.955 --> 00:19:48.292
It always seemed strange,
but that's the way he is, I guess.

00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:32.920
She kept pestering me to see you,
so I brought her in with me.

00:20:33.003 --> 00:20:34.338
You only have ten minutes.

00:20:35.172 --> 00:20:37.383
-I'll be back to get her.
-Okay.

00:20:37.466 --> 00:20:38.634
I appreciate it, ma'am.

00:20:42.054 --> 00:20:43.138
You okay?

00:20:43.639 --> 00:20:45.516
They're feeding you every day, right?

00:20:46.392 --> 00:20:49.520
And those cops,
they better not be abusing you in here.

00:20:49.979 --> 00:20:53.190
You tell me if they are,
and I'll kill them all, okay?

00:20:55.401 --> 00:20:56.735
How can you be laughing?

00:20:57.611 --> 00:21:00.739
I was thinking how I wouldn't expect
anything less from you.

00:21:02.575 --> 00:21:03.742
Shit.

00:21:12.418 --> 00:21:16.213
Whatever happens to me in the future,
I want you to stay out of it.

00:21:18.674 --> 00:21:20.426
-Why?
-Just do what I say.

00:21:21.135 --> 00:21:22.511
Don't worry about me.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.899
In my workbench,
take a look in the drawer at the bottom.

00:21:34.982 --> 00:21:36.901
All the money in there is yours.

00:21:43.741 --> 00:21:44.742
Coming.

00:21:46.577 --> 00:21:48.370
What are you planning to do right now?

00:22:10.434 --> 00:22:13.979
Breaking news. The suspect
in Assemblyman Baek's murder case

00:22:14.063 --> 00:22:15.272
has finally confessed.

00:22:15.356 --> 00:22:18.025
According to the confession,
after his release from prison,

00:22:18.108 --> 00:22:20.027
the suspect found
the assemblyman's address

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.780
via a TV interview,
and sent him threatening letters.

00:22:22.863 --> 00:22:25.157
But after no response,
the suspect murdered him.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.618
It's him.
Didn't he just get released?

00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:30.579
...whether to disclose personal details
of Mr. Noh,

00:22:30.663 --> 00:22:32.581
who committed this premeditated murder

00:22:32.665 --> 00:22:34.249
and a conclusion is expected soon.

00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:37.044
Mr. Noh, who had persistently
denied the crime,

00:22:37.127 --> 00:22:39.755
began to confess
after decisive evidence emerged

00:22:39.838 --> 00:22:42.007
and the police are now focusing
all efforts

00:22:42.091 --> 00:22:45.177
on securing additional evidence
based on his testimony.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.227
I have an appointment
with Detective Hwang.

00:22:53.769 --> 00:22:57.356
To be clear, you're admitting
that you threatened Assemblyman Baek,

00:22:57.439 --> 00:23:00.317
and when things didn't go your way,
you killed him?

00:23:01.402 --> 00:23:02.861
Yes, I killed him.

00:23:02.945 --> 00:23:05.280
Why are you making me repeat myself
over and over?

00:23:05.364 --> 00:23:06.699
I already said I did it.

00:23:06.782 --> 00:23:08.492
What else do you want from me?

00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:11.245
You guys win, okay? You caught me.

00:23:11.328 --> 00:23:13.163
You found all that evidence at my house.

00:23:13.247 --> 00:23:15.124
So don't you have everything you need?

00:23:16.709 --> 00:23:17.918
That's enough.

00:23:22.798 --> 00:23:23.882
Detective.

00:23:27.302 --> 00:23:29.596
You know what the scariest thing
in prison is?

00:23:30.305 --> 00:23:31.640
It's the other inmates.

00:23:32.599 --> 00:23:35.769
That's why they're always trying
to prove how dangerous they are.

00:23:37.104 --> 00:23:38.939
They put on a facade for protection

00:23:39.023 --> 00:23:41.567
and pretend to be someone
that they're not.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.987
I can spot those people from a mile away,
and I'm telling you,

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.530
that man is faking it.

00:23:47.364 --> 00:23:48.407
Hmm.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.872
Even with his confession,
you're still entertaining these theories.

00:23:54.955 --> 00:23:56.165
It's not a theory!

00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.168
It's experience.

00:23:59.251 --> 00:24:01.086
They can't think in the long term.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.588
They don't care.

00:24:02.671 --> 00:24:06.050
Because of that, they'll throw
everything away in order to survive.

00:24:06.133 --> 00:24:07.301
So what then?

00:24:09.094 --> 00:24:10.387
What I saw in that room...

00:24:12.431 --> 00:24:13.807
was someone lying to us.

00:24:15.601 --> 00:24:17.019
Just to protect his family.

00:24:17.102 --> 00:24:18.145
You think?

00:24:18.687 --> 00:24:21.023
I'm pretty sure he admitted
to the whole thing.

00:24:23.609 --> 00:24:25.277
I'm begging you to listen to me.

00:24:27.488 --> 00:24:28.739
Enough of your shit.

00:24:29.782 --> 00:24:33.410
Maybe you forgot, but he already
went to prison for murdering his wife.

00:24:35.412 --> 00:24:37.498
All you need to do is stay in your lane

00:24:37.581 --> 00:24:40.000
and leave the detective work
to the real authorities.

00:24:40.626 --> 00:24:42.377
You're just a useless prison guard.

00:24:48.467 --> 00:24:50.636
Who the fuck does
this asshole think he is?

00:25:07.945 --> 00:25:09.780
What? He's not the killer?

00:25:09.863 --> 00:25:12.658
Someone's claiming
he's the one who killed Assemblyman Baek!

00:25:12.741 --> 00:25:13.992
What the hell?

00:25:14.076 --> 00:25:16.829
- What's this asshole doing outside?
- I've no idea.

00:25:23.627 --> 00:25:25.087
Put down the knife!

00:25:27.422 --> 00:25:28.799
Bring him in.

00:25:36.932 --> 00:25:38.142
What a surprise.

00:25:40.477 --> 00:25:41.770
How you been?

00:25:45.524 --> 00:25:46.692
Good work. Get the knife.

00:25:46.775 --> 00:25:47.776
Understood, sir.

00:25:53.824 --> 00:25:54.908
Let's go.

00:26:05.752 --> 00:26:07.588
All right. Take a left up here.

00:26:08.213 --> 00:26:09.214
Keep walking.

00:26:15.679 --> 00:26:17.723
- Taejoong.
- Wait! Stop him.

00:26:17.806 --> 00:26:19.183
-Hey. Keep moving!
-Wait. No!

00:26:19.266 --> 00:26:21.518
-Taejoong!
-All right, don't make this difficult.

00:26:21.602 --> 00:26:23.770
-Take him this way.
-I can't do this right now.

00:26:23.854 --> 00:26:24.855
-Come on.
-Taejoong!

00:26:24.938 --> 00:26:26.982
Don't make this harder than it has to be.

00:26:43.498 --> 00:26:44.958
Give me your hands.

00:27:25.415 --> 00:27:27.125
That's my little girl.

00:27:27.209 --> 00:27:28.293
Papa!

00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:32.005
Watch your step
when you run, sweetheart.

00:27:32.089 --> 00:27:34.633
Can you find me
a four-leaf clover, Daddy?

00:27:34.716 --> 00:27:37.469
Of course, darling.
Let's go find one together.

00:27:43.433 --> 00:27:46.561
We'll make sure to find you
the best four-leaf clover.

00:27:46.645 --> 00:27:48.397
Do you see any? Is that one?

00:27:55.779 --> 00:27:57.489
Eunbi.

00:28:11.128 --> 00:28:12.129
Go.

00:28:13.005 --> 00:28:14.423
I said go.

00:28:14.506 --> 00:28:16.174
I don't want to see you!

00:28:16.258 --> 00:28:18.927
Eunbi.

00:28:19.636 --> 00:28:22.723
If you like it there so much,
why bother coming out? Huh?

00:28:23.724 --> 00:28:26.393
Is taking the blame
the only thing you know how to do?

00:28:27.185 --> 00:28:28.603
What's wrong with you?

00:28:29.271 --> 00:28:32.190
Why'd you confess to something
that you know you didn't do?

00:28:32.274 --> 00:28:34.067
Eunbi.

00:28:35.694 --> 00:28:39.448
I don't understand why you had to
go and turn yourself in like that.

00:28:39.948 --> 00:28:40.949
I'm sorry.

00:28:41.033 --> 00:28:44.327
I can't keep watching you leave
over and over again.

00:28:44.411 --> 00:28:46.079
I'm so sorry.

00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:49.624
I promise I'll never leave you again.

00:28:49.708 --> 00:28:50.792
I'm sorry.

00:28:54.546 --> 00:28:55.797
I'm sorry.

00:28:58.592 --> 00:28:59.634
I'm right here.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.720
No, no. Listen to me.

00:29:01.803 --> 00:29:03.722
He showed up last night with the knife...

00:29:08.101 --> 00:29:10.353
He turned himself in
so we weren't legally allowed

00:29:10.437 --> 00:29:12.647
to detain Noh Yongsik
longer than 48 hours.

00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:15.400
What?

00:29:17.152 --> 00:29:19.071
What do you mean
you'll handle it yourself?

00:29:19.154 --> 00:29:21.114
Hello? Mr. An?

00:29:22.908 --> 00:29:24.367
Shit! I'm screwed, aren't I?

00:29:29.831 --> 00:29:31.792
You. Leave.

00:29:31.875 --> 00:29:33.502
-What?
-Get the fuck out.

00:29:42.844 --> 00:29:43.970
What made you do this?

00:29:46.598 --> 00:29:49.851
I gave you every opportunity
to make the smart choice, didn't I?

00:29:49.935 --> 00:29:53.814
If you'd waited one more day,
Noh Yongsik would've killed himself.

00:29:53.897 --> 00:29:55.232
You should've held out.

00:29:55.774 --> 00:29:59.027
Why would you run head first
into your own death sentence?

00:29:59.111 --> 00:30:00.112
Tell me.

00:30:03.657 --> 00:30:06.076
No one ever answers me
when I'm speaking to them,

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:07.244
and I'm sick of it!

00:30:10.831 --> 00:30:11.998
You don't get it.

00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:14.626
You're asking the wrong questions.

00:30:16.378 --> 00:30:18.630
So there's no use in giving you an answer.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:22.801
It's funny...

00:30:24.302 --> 00:30:25.720
I was always so curious.

00:30:28.765 --> 00:30:30.642
I kept wondering who the fuck you were

00:30:30.725 --> 00:30:33.436
and why you were doing
such horrible things to me.

00:30:34.187 --> 00:30:36.064
But looking at you now, I realize...

00:30:37.232 --> 00:30:38.483
you're nothing but a kid.

00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:44.906
I'm getting bored, so I think we're done.

00:30:45.824 --> 00:30:47.367
This is what you want?

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.035
You can die, then.

00:31:08.513 --> 00:31:10.849
What happens after an escapee is caught?

00:31:10.932 --> 00:31:13.643
We take custody
as according to procedure.

00:31:13.727 --> 00:31:14.728
And after that?

00:31:14.811 --> 00:31:17.314
There's usually another trial
for the criminal offenses.

00:31:18.231 --> 00:31:22.110
But since he's already sentenced to life,
I'm not sure they can do much more.

00:31:23.069 --> 00:31:24.279
Let's kill him, then.

00:31:24.362 --> 00:31:25.488
What?

00:31:25.572 --> 00:31:27.741
You can choose how you'd like to do it,

00:31:27.824 --> 00:31:30.035
but just make sure you take care of it.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.745
Okay, I understand.

00:32:03.318 --> 00:32:04.819
2802, Park Taejoong.

00:32:04.903 --> 00:32:06.363
I'm here to transport him.

00:32:07.739 --> 00:32:09.616
Okay. I'll let them know you're here.

00:32:15.956 --> 00:32:18.792
Park Taejoong.
Stand up so we can cuff you.

00:32:19.668 --> 00:32:21.127
You're going back to prison.

00:32:33.098 --> 00:32:34.349
-Welcome back, sir.
-Yeah.

00:32:47.988 --> 00:32:50.365
I told you he was scheduled
to be interrogated more,

00:32:50.448 --> 00:32:51.574
so why are you here?

00:32:51.658 --> 00:32:53.535
You came earlier than expected.

00:32:53.618 --> 00:32:57.414
If you need to question him, you can
just apply for visitation at the prison.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.458
This is revenge for earlier?

00:33:00.542 --> 00:33:03.753
I have to follow standard procedure.
I'm only a prison guard, remember?

00:33:03.837 --> 00:33:06.423
You prison guards love your procedures,
don't you?

00:33:08.508 --> 00:33:09.509
Okay.

00:33:12.804 --> 00:33:13.847
Fine.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:15.056
Get out of here.

00:33:15.724 --> 00:33:16.725
Come on.

00:33:41.041 --> 00:33:42.584
Let's go.

00:33:42.667 --> 00:33:45.420
EMERGENCY TRANSFER
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

00:33:57.265 --> 00:33:59.851
We've had to upgrade
a lot of things because of you.

00:34:01.186 --> 00:34:04.314
The ventilation ducts,
we installed wire mesh.

00:34:04.397 --> 00:34:06.524
There's increased security
for visitation, too.

00:34:09.778 --> 00:34:12.697
Thanks to you, we're better off now.

00:34:19.662 --> 00:34:20.747
Hey...

00:34:22.082 --> 00:34:25.126
The items in that locker...
Why give them to me?

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.548
Those items are the key to the truth.

00:34:32.926 --> 00:34:36.221
And you were the only one from the prison
that I felt I could give it to.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:38.932
You have a lot of faith.

00:34:40.725 --> 00:34:42.560
What if I had thrown those things away?

00:34:42.644 --> 00:34:44.979
Come on.
You don't even throw away sick plants.

00:34:52.237 --> 00:34:53.822
I heard you turned yourself in.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.241
Does that mean you've given up now?

00:35:00.954 --> 00:35:02.205
I don't know.

00:35:05.709 --> 00:35:08.002
Actually, you're right. I'm done running.

00:35:09.129 --> 00:35:10.213
You know...

00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:13.341
I don't regret
turning myself in to save him.

00:35:20.432 --> 00:35:21.516
Even back then...

00:35:23.977 --> 00:35:26.062
I'm not sure I ever really understood you

00:35:27.564 --> 00:35:29.232
and I don't think I ever will.

00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:35.947
Hey, let's take a break
at the next rest stop.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:37.282
Understood, sir.

00:35:40.452 --> 00:35:43.163
GOYANG REST STOP

00:35:45.123 --> 00:35:47.584
Since we're stopping,
I might as well use the bathroom.

00:37:06.454 --> 00:37:07.539
Hands.

00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:13.753
From this point on,
a new road is ahead of you.

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:18.675
What are you doing?

00:37:18.758 --> 00:37:19.759
Get a move on.

00:37:22.428 --> 00:37:23.513
Come on.

00:37:33.439 --> 00:37:34.524
If you go that way,

00:37:35.316 --> 00:37:36.693
a van will be waiting for you.

00:37:38.027 --> 00:37:39.362
I wish I could do more.

00:37:39.863 --> 00:37:40.905
I truly do.

00:37:40.989 --> 00:37:42.657
But I have no real power.

00:37:43.283 --> 00:37:44.742
I'm only a prison guard.

00:37:44.826 --> 00:37:46.661
So this is the best I can do for you.

00:37:48.246 --> 00:37:49.247
Go on.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.166
Oh, and Taejoong,

00:37:53.001 --> 00:37:54.419
next time, instead of prison,

00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:56.713
I hope we meet somewhere better.

00:38:11.102 --> 00:38:12.145
Park Taejoong.

00:38:12.228 --> 00:38:14.022
I needed to prove my innocence.

00:38:14.105 --> 00:38:16.399
So I'm at the culprit's location now.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.154
Park Taejoong's whereabouts
have been found.

00:38:21.237 --> 00:38:22.614
BUSAN TERMINAL AREA B

00:38:32.832 --> 00:38:35.084
I was just
following orders from above.

00:38:36.294 --> 00:38:37.921
Her name's So Hyeonjeong.

00:38:38.004 --> 00:38:39.464
She's the next victim.

00:38:39.547 --> 00:38:42.091
They'll begin sculpting with her soon.

00:38:42.175 --> 00:38:44.093
We're creating evidence to use.

00:38:44.719 --> 00:38:48.848
When a client commits murder, they look
for a victim to be the scapegoat.

00:38:52.018 --> 00:38:53.311
Okay, I understand.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.647
Consider it done.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.732
Don't worry about 2802.

00:38:57.815 --> 00:38:59.400
I'll make sure he ends up dead.

00:39:07.116 --> 00:39:08.743
What have I gotten myself into?

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:42.276
Taejoong!

00:39:45.905 --> 00:39:47.407
Hurry, over here!

00:39:47.907 --> 00:39:48.908
Let's get moving.

00:39:53.121 --> 00:39:54.247
You need an escape?

00:39:55.498 --> 00:39:56.499
Get in.

00:39:56.582 --> 00:39:57.834
Let's get out of here.

00:40:25.695 --> 00:40:27.155
Why is he alone?

00:40:30.908 --> 00:40:32.660
Why isn't 2802 with you?

00:40:32.744 --> 00:40:33.828
Because, Warden,

00:40:34.954 --> 00:40:37.915
after thinking about it,
I made a change of plans.

00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:39.250
Are you fucking crazy?

00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:40.460
Have you lost your mind?

00:40:40.543 --> 00:40:42.253
You're gonna be disciplined for this.

00:40:43.671 --> 00:40:45.548
Go ahead. Discipline me?

00:40:45.631 --> 00:40:48.551
I've called Internal Affairs
and I'll tell them everything.

00:40:48.634 --> 00:40:49.635
But what about you?

00:40:49.719 --> 00:40:52.221
Will you admit
you were gonna kill him for money?

00:40:52.305 --> 00:40:53.723
You stupid son of a bitch!

00:40:53.806 --> 00:40:55.266
Where's all this coming from?

00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:56.768
-This isn't like you.
-Shut up!

00:40:57.685 --> 00:40:58.853
You shut your mouth.

00:41:00.188 --> 00:41:02.857
Now, with the latest story
from the art world,

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.402
Arleli, the famous and mysterious artist,
has announced their decision

00:41:06.486 --> 00:41:09.572
to finally reveal themselves
to the public for the first time.

00:41:10.073 --> 00:41:11.783
Sources tell me that this will happen

00:41:11.866 --> 00:41:14.702
at a special exhibition
unveiling the 100th sculpture.

00:41:15.453 --> 00:41:18.331
Additionally, this piece will be
up for auction at the event,

00:41:18.414 --> 00:41:20.583
stirring excitement in Korea's art scene.

00:41:20.666 --> 00:41:22.251
- What's all this?
- Here.

00:41:25.755 --> 00:41:28.549
I wasn't sure what we needed,
so I grabbed whatever I could.

00:41:32.136 --> 00:41:33.221
Let's do it.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.099
That son of a bitch
needs to be taught a lesson.

00:41:37.475 --> 00:41:39.811
Just think of this as divine intervention.

00:41:52.615 --> 00:41:56.536
