00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.880
You've asked almost half the class lately.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.520
All your questions are about Su Ruo.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.280
Zhang Xun says you've lost your mind.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.520
If you keep this up,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.200
you'll die for love.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.120
You asked me to find things from back then.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.000
This is all I could find.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.640
Su Ruo's college preference form.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.120
She didn't turn it in?

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.760
She lost her exam admission ticket before the test.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.240
She missed the first subject.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.880
By the second subject,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.200
they found it and brought it to her.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.360
When it was time to fill out preferences,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.600
she completely broke down.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.600
She left the form blank and walked away.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.080
So I kept it for her.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.760
If only, back then,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.960
Su Ruo could've finished the exam smoothly.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.760
Did a teacher help deliver it?

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.760
No idea.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.280
Someone gave it to the police, I think.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.320
The police brought it over.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.040
But that person didn't leave a name.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.640
Anyway,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.120
Su Ruo was in a bad state then.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.520
She missed one subject.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.480
She didn't even get into a junior college.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.280
Her parents died young.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.600
She had no one and entered society alone.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.680
It's about time.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.440
I'm heading out.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.400
I'll head back too, then.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.320
Oh, right.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.840
What was your Gaokao score?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.320
Bro,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.560
do you remember who I am?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.120
Don't just stand there.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.120
Drive.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.240
Fifteen years.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.560
I'm telling you, fifteen years.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.200
Bro,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.680
Fifteen years of what?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.400
I've followed Di Ge for fifteen years.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.960
Finally got a way to make a living.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.760
But you blocked the car that day,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.760
and he got arrested.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.800
Now you ask where I'm going.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.080
I wish I knew where I could go.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.800
Bro,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.480
Di Ge broke the law.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.920
You can't blame me for this.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.600
Not blaming you.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.960
Just wanted to chat with you, buddy.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.920
Anyone here?

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.000
Somebody, help!

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.680
According to Newton's Third Law,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.240
there's about twenty minutes left.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.080
Wait, that's not right.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.640
Bro, you need to calm down.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.480
We're just joking around.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.080
Just stretching a bit.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.880
Yeah, bro.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.720
Stay calm.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.040
You're still young.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.240
Don't go down the path of crime.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.080
It's too late.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.640
It's too late.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.720
This time, the calculation is off.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.360
I can still save her.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.800
We'll let you go.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.400
There's a deviation this time.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.280
The number you dialed is powered off.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480
Time's up.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.720
Did I lose my last chance?

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.600
You're a guy.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.800
If you like someone in the future,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.040
just say it out loud.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.680
By the way, Yu Xingchen,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.840
do you still like me?

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.120
The wind's picking up.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.800
Su Ruo.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360
Is that you?

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.440
Maybe it's too late to say this now.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.760
But I need to tell you,

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.760
this time, both time and place

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.120
will be a little off.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.320
Yu Xingchen.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.360
Save me.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.320
Wait for me.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.360
Take a photo, take a photo!

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.160
Come on, come on!

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.720
Spacetime has a rejection property.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.600
If it detects

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.280
something that doesn't belong here,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.600
it will force you back to your original world.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.880
If you try to fight this rule,

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.360
your body may suffer irreversible trauma.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.760
Son,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.040
you're awake.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.880
That's great.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.280
You really scared me.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.560
Does it hurt?

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:25.880
You're awake.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.880
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.040
Want some water?

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.720
Son,

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.440
where does it hurt?

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:33.800
I...

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.800
Who am I?

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.640
How is he?

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.680
This kind of temporary amnesia is common.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.920
But his daily activities

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.720
and intelligence aren't affected.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.800
Brain CT scan

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.360
shows no physical damage.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.000
So let's wait a bit longer.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.560
He should be able to remember.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.040
How long until he recovers?

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.640
Gaokao is next week.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.560
Can he still make it in this state?

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.880
Why are you still talking about Gaokao now?

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.720
Gaokao...

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.600
Are you sure

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.840
I'm in senior year now?

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.720
Why can't I solve

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.160
any of these questions?

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:29.960
Darn it.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.120
Darn it.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.880
I even told my director

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.800
my son could get into a first-tier university.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.640
Now I've really embarrassed myself.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.680
Why are you saying this at a time like this?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.680
It's really over.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.360
What's wrong now?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.400
Always so jumpy.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.640
Forgot to turn off the stove.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.760
You and your son,

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.480
if I weren't here,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.400
what would you do?

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.760
Day after day, this...

00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.880
I'll go.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.480
But I really don't have time.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.560
It's okay.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.680
Tomorrow,

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.800
everyone will go home
and study on their own.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.160
Don't overwork yourselves.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.880
These next few days

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.200
rest is really important.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.520
Especially the first day.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.400
Make sure to rest early.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.720
Don't get too excited.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.920
Finish breakfast forty-five minutes
before the exam.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.600
Don't eat anything too greasy.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.200
If you get diarrhea then,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.400
you won't even have time to cry.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.280
By the way,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.960
who lives close to Yu Xingchen's home?

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.080
Someone needs to deliver
his exam admission ticket.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.720
Did something happen
to Yu Xingchen lately?

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.160
Why isn't he coming
to get his exam ticket?

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.480
I heard he was in a car accident.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.760
A car accident?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.000
But it shouldn't affect the exam.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.360
Otherwise, they wouldn't ask us

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.640
to deliver his exam ticket.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.600
I thought

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.680
he wasn't coming to school
to avoid me.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.560
Maybe

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.880
I said something
that confused him.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.560
Su Ruo,

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.720
after the Gaokao is over,

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.840
will you and Yu Xingchen

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.160
still keep in touch?

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.680
Anyway,

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.720
just focus on the exam for now.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.320
Thank you.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.560
I seem to have forgotten
a lot of things.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.120
Please don't mind.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.120
Maybe that's for the best.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.440
Do you still

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.720
remember this place?

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.960
No matter how things end,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.520
we'll face it together.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.680
I've played here
since I was little.
