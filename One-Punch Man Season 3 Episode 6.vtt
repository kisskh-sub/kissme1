MOTLEY HEROES

01:42.936 --> 01:44.854
<i>I used the satellite, Shoji Peeper</i>

01:44.938 --> 01:47.899
<i>to check the number of monsters</i>
<i>inside the enemy's hideout.</i>

01:47.982 --> 01:51.277
Thermal readings show that
there appear to be 500 monsters.

01:51.361 --> 01:55.073
If you do the simple math, each of us
has to take down over 60 monsters.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.201
The only concern would be the strength
of the enemy's top brass.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.745
We now know, Centichoro,
who appeared the other day,

02:00.829 --> 02:03.581
was also working
for the Monster Association

02:03.665 --> 02:06.417
so we should assume that they have
several other monsters

02:06.501 --> 02:08.837
at threat-level Demon or even Dragon.

02:08.920 --> 02:13.842
I was guarding the headquarters,
so I only fought one parasite.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.302
What about you guys
who were fighting out there?

02:16.386 --> 02:17.804
Were they strong?

02:17.887 --> 02:20.306
It felt like a real mixed bag.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.726
Most of them weren't much,
but there were a few really nasty ones

02:23.810 --> 02:26.271
and even I had some close calls.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.438
CRACKING

02:27.522 --> 02:31.234
Now that I've learned to accept the pain,
it's not gonna be a problem.

02:31.317 --> 02:34.362
Is it true that
Drive Knight got taken out?

02:34.445 --> 02:35.572
I don't know…

02:35.655 --> 02:38.074
He tortured a monster
and was the first to discover

02:38.158 --> 02:42.537
that their hideout was in City Z,
so he went to investigate.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.039
But we haven't heard from him since.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.375
So he was taken out, huh?

02:47.458 --> 02:50.295
He's got a cyborg body,

02:50.378 --> 02:52.839
so it doesn't necessarily mean
that he's dead.

02:52.922 --> 02:56.092
Maybe his parts were destroyed,
and he can't move or send a signal,

02:56.175 --> 02:58.761
so he's lying low somewhere
just waiting to be rescued.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.972
Let's hope so…

03:01.931 --> 03:06.644
What this means is, any of us
could end up like Drive Knight.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.313
So don't let your guard down.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.731
Stay sharp.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.609
I doubt they can defeat me.

03:12.692 --> 03:16.237
They'll strike without mercy
the minute we run into them.

03:16.321 --> 03:20.241
Of course, even if a monster
tries to negotiate,

03:20.325 --> 03:21.993
we do not need to respond.

03:22.076 --> 03:25.496
That's right.
Showing mercy will get you killed.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.124
Can I say something?
Among the Monster Association,

03:28.207 --> 03:31.961
there are also young men who were
tricked and turned into monsters.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.505
I want to save those guys.

03:34.589 --> 03:38.426
If you see monsters in prison uniforms,
let me deal with them.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.346
An old friend of mine turned
into a monster too,

03:41.429 --> 03:43.389
so I had no choice but to slash him.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.893
Is there any way to save those
who've been monsterized?

03:46.976 --> 03:50.271
I plan on trying a combo of Angel Hug
and Awakening Deep Kiss

03:50.355 --> 03:52.857
to see if they can snap out of it.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.276
I see… Okay then… Sorry I asked.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.903
Let's get back to the topic.

03:56.986 --> 04:00.531
The boss, Monster King Orochi,
and the strategist, Gyoro-Gyoro

04:00.615 --> 04:02.867
are without a doubt threat level-Dragon.

04:02.951 --> 04:07.622
Yeah, they're strong enough
to command this many monsters.

04:07.705 --> 04:10.833
We should avoid one-on-one fights
where possible.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.836
Fine, I'll take down the final boss.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.716
You guys handle the small fry
that get in my way, okay?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.551
Hey, don't just decide on your own.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.679
What? You wanna fight the final boss?

04:22.762 --> 04:25.640
- Shut her up. This is pointless.
- This is for you wimps.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.225
Now, now, you two…

04:27.767 --> 04:30.311
<i>This is why I hate</i>
<i>managing Class-S heroes.</i>

04:30.395 --> 04:34.148
We're not here to direct traffic.

04:34.232 --> 04:37.068
This is a hostage rescue mission.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.945
Monster hunting is only a bonus.

04:39.028 --> 04:42.115
Don't forget about that, Tornado.

04:42.198 --> 04:46.035
You'd better not launch an attack
that'll wipe out the entire hideout.

04:46.911 --> 04:49.205
The underground is quite vast and deep.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.623
Even with my investigation,

04:50.707 --> 04:54.752
I can't pinpoint the exact location
of the boss in the hideout.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.797
If you run into something,
a small fry or the boss,

04:57.880 --> 04:59.257
a fight is unavoidable.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.926
Anyone who encounters them
must take them out.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.013
If we'd known the boss's location or
where the hostages were,

05:05.096 --> 05:07.181
we could've done this
with far fewer people.

05:07.265 --> 05:11.019
Why do you think we've been
waiting around for everyone to gather?

05:11.102 --> 05:14.814
That much should be obvious
if you'd just think a little…

05:15.356 --> 05:17.317
Instead of relying
on your psychic powers,

05:17.400 --> 05:19.485
how about using your head once in a while?

05:19.569 --> 05:22.363
Stop, stop! That's enough!

05:22.905 --> 05:23.740
Hey.

05:23.823 --> 05:27.327
You guys… I was wondering
why you weren't in the waiting room.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.413
I'm on the team, yet you are
having a secret meeting without me.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.706
What's this mean?

05:31.789 --> 05:33.207
Amai Mask!

05:34.125 --> 05:37.170
We weren't trying
to exclude you or anything.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.672
We first wanted to discuss it
among Class-S heroes.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.090
Why only Class-S?

05:41.591 --> 05:44.177
There are other members
on the team like me, right?

05:44.260 --> 05:45.470
Um, well…

05:45.553 --> 05:49.223
<i>Everyone below Class-S is going</i>
<i>to be assigned to surface backup.</i>

05:49.307 --> 05:51.642
<i>I knew he would complain,</i>

05:51.726 --> 05:54.437
<i>so I was going to tell him</i>
<i>at the last minute.</i>

05:55.021 --> 05:59.692
<i>How can I explain this</i>
<i>without hurting his pride?</i>

05:59.776 --> 06:02.236
Why? Because we all hate you.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.362
No, that's not true.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.115
You're making it worse, Tornado!

06:06.282 --> 06:09.827
Me assigned to surface standby?
Care to explain yourself?

06:09.911 --> 06:13.664
Yes, the attack team goes underground and

06:13.748 --> 06:16.793
the support team stays above ground.
We split up into two teams.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.670
We wanted to utilize
your leadership skills and

06:19.754 --> 06:22.965
have you take command
of the support team, Amai Mask.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.010
We'll be the only ones
attacking underground.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.596
Deal with any monsters we miss behind us.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.641
<i>But I'll be bringing my disciples along.</i>

06:31.724 --> 06:33.643
Twenty more pizzas, please.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.104
Don't stuff yourself before battle.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.397
Get protein instead, Pig God.

06:38.481 --> 06:41.317
No. I can't trust you guys
to handle it by yourselves.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.735
I'm going in too.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.362
<i>I knew he'd say that.</i>

06:44.445 --> 06:46.656
Do I have to spell it out for you?

06:46.739 --> 06:50.118
This fight is way out of your league.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.410
You're out of the lineup!

06:51.494 --> 06:53.663
Child Emperor,
you don't seem to understand.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.457
- Hey! Don't ignore me!
- If you want my leadership,

06:56.541 --> 06:59.502
then the Class-S heroes
should be under my command.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.712
- Under your command?
- Pretending not to hear?

07:01.796 --> 07:03.548
You're name is funny enough.

07:04.048 --> 07:07.301
You just want the credit?
Fine, take mine.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.178
But follow Child Emperor's orders.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.597
This isn't the time to be holding
each other back.

07:11.681 --> 07:12.515
That's right!

07:12.598 --> 07:15.560
You shouldn't be putting on perfume
before a battle, you idiot!

07:15.643 --> 07:18.479
We're about to face an army of monsters.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.982
This isn't the time to be
dragging each other down.

07:21.065 --> 07:24.026
- Zombieman, why are you immortal?
- You smell! Change your name!

07:24.110 --> 07:25.111
It's creepy.

07:25.194 --> 07:28.281
Maybe you're actually a monster.

07:28.364 --> 07:29.449
What'd you just say?

07:29.532 --> 07:34.162
You're ranked Class S based
solely on your combat ability,

07:34.245 --> 07:36.622
but your true identity is questionable.

07:36.706 --> 07:40.084
Can we really trust
that you're on our side?

07:40.168 --> 07:43.087
Hey now, stop pushing him.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.923
This isn't right.
Heroes shouldn't be fighting each other.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.593
Yeah, you're supposed to be
a pro hero, and yet…

07:48.676 --> 07:49.635
What the heck?

07:49.719 --> 07:54.432
If you've gotta problem,
forget the battle and go sing alone.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.685
You Class-S heroes acting
like you're above it all.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.312
Your arrogance has gone too far.

07:59.395 --> 08:01.689
You have a bad rep in the Association.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.984
It doesn't look like
you're giving your best.

08:05.067 --> 08:08.237
Oh, and five more liters of cola, please.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.782
Aren't you forgetting the responsibility
that comes with power?

08:11.866 --> 08:12.783
Wait a sec!

08:12.867 --> 08:15.244
Why are you working
as an idol on the side?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.329
That's ridiculous.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.290
You call yourself Handsome Kamen,
but you're not so handsome!

08:19.373 --> 08:20.708
Do you get that?

08:20.791 --> 08:22.376
C-Calm down.

08:22.460 --> 08:26.005
If you piss off Amai Mask, the media
will tear you apart. It'll be trouble.

08:26.088 --> 08:31.052
You Class-S heroes only get to exist
because you're kept under control.

08:31.135 --> 08:35.264
Otherwise, you're just dangerous
individuals with high combat power.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.142
So this time, I'll put you to good use.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.769
Follow my orders.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.399
<i>A master-servant relationship</i>
<i>with an assertive handsome guy.</i>

08:45.483 --> 08:47.485
<i>Not bad, but troubling…</i>

08:47.568 --> 08:50.363
Why not try and make us obey by force?

08:50.446 --> 08:51.739
If you think you can.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.992
Do you think I can't?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.497
Hey, this is no joke.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.415
Stop that murderous glare, Flash.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.669
It's up to him.
If he interferes with the operation…

09:04.752 --> 09:06.504
Mr. King has arrived!

09:07.713 --> 09:12.093
RUMBLE RUMBLE

09:12.176 --> 09:14.637
King, what perfect timing.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.597
You'll be under my command too…?!

09:16.681 --> 09:19.809
Why are you so filthy?
And you stink too.

09:19.892 --> 09:23.980
Oh yeah, I was brought here
right after I got home,

09:24.063 --> 09:26.023
so I didn't have a chance to change.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.776
Oh dang, this is gonna leave a stain.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.779
Why were you so late?
Where have you been?

09:31.862 --> 09:33.531
How did you get like that?

09:33.614 --> 09:35.074
<i>What's with the interrogation?</i>

09:35.157 --> 09:37.493
<i>I never did like this guy.</i>

09:37.577 --> 09:42.039
Well, it's not really anything
worth mentioning.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.250
But I was in City Z…

09:44.333 --> 09:46.335
- having hot pot--
- Mr. King was

09:46.419 --> 09:49.755
fighting alone near the enemy hideout
in City Z all night!

09:49.839 --> 09:50.715
Huh?

09:50.798 --> 09:53.217
The stains on his clothes
are the monsters' blood.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.220
As proof, the splatters
are only on the front.

09:56.304 --> 10:00.016
Outnumbered, he drained his strength
and pulled back.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.518
That's when we found him
and escorted him here!

10:02.602 --> 10:06.647
<i>Why do these people always get</i>
<i>the wrong idea and spread it around?</i>

10:06.731 --> 10:09.900
Fighting nonstop… all by himself…

10:11.986 --> 10:12.862
Impressive.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.992
Your decisiveness, your fearless resolve.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.827
I have to hand it to you.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.371
Apparently, there are
some decent Class-S heroes.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.498
Quarreling among ourselves is pointless.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.834
For King's sake, I'll back down.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.713
But I'm still on the attack team.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.006
That's non-negotiable.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.800
<i>Incredible. He's not backing down at all.</i>

10:34.884 --> 10:40.890
- King, you can't fight the enemy alone.
- No…

10:40.973 --> 10:45.102
Just like you, Drive Knight went alone
to investigate the ghost town,

10:45.186 --> 10:47.480
and since then,
we've lost all contact with him.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.983
Who knows what kind of threat
might be lurking there?

10:51.067 --> 10:52.443
Let's all fight together.

10:54.862 --> 10:55.696
Sure…!

11:03.496 --> 11:05.373
<i>The support team has assembled.</i>

11:05.456 --> 11:06.957
It's time to depart.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.295
This is a critical moment.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.254
Yeah.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.715
Are you planning to go to the scene?

11:14.799 --> 11:17.426
As the one responsible,
I'll see this through.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.514
I've underestimated you.
Who knew you had such backbone.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.558
I thought you were just driven
by ambition for promotion.

11:25.434 --> 11:26.894
You're not wrong there.

11:26.977 --> 11:30.398
Defeating the Monster Association
will guarantee a promotion…

11:33.192 --> 11:35.361
And my name will go down in history.

11:41.617 --> 11:45.246
Thank you all for coming. I'm Sekingal.

11:45.329 --> 11:46.497
And I'm Sitch.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.917
Is everyone clear on today's mission?

11:50.000 --> 11:54.463
Yes, sir! Today's event is
to support Class-S heroes.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.090
Um… okay…

11:56.173 --> 11:57.633
<i>Event?</i>

11:58.467 --> 12:02.346
Specifically, you will eliminate
any monsters who escape,

12:02.430 --> 12:05.099
secure evacuation routes,
and protect the child.

12:05.182 --> 12:08.394
Once the Class-S heroes storm in
and rescue the hostage,

12:08.477 --> 12:10.813
you will safely escort him
back to headquarters.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.107
That is the most important mission.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.692
Can I say something?

12:14.775 --> 12:15.651
What is it?

12:15.734 --> 12:19.071
We're risking our necks diving
straight into enemy territory

12:19.155 --> 12:21.490
without knowing what's waiting for us.

12:21.574 --> 12:26.454
At the very least,
I want my hero ranking bumped up.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.080
Otherwise, it ain't worth it.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.167
Fine. I promise.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.793
All right!

12:33.544 --> 12:34.795
Well, Sitch?

12:34.879 --> 12:38.424
Looks like humanity's protectors
are stronger than ever, right?

12:38.507 --> 12:40.092
Uh…yeah…

12:40.176 --> 12:41.594
Excuse me, Mr. Sitch…

12:44.180 --> 12:45.389
What?!

12:49.393 --> 12:53.731
Yo, Sitch. I dropped
my portable phone somewhere.

12:53.814 --> 12:56.442
Sorry, but can you give me a new one?

12:56.525 --> 13:00.446
O-Okay. Got it.
I'll get you one right away.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.573
<i>Remember, Sitch.</i>

13:02.656 --> 13:04.783
<i>Send him back</i>
<i>without telling him anything.</i>

13:04.867 --> 13:08.329
And about Garou's hideout…

13:08.412 --> 13:10.581
Have you gotten any new information?

13:10.664 --> 13:14.168
I imagine he's still
with the monster group.

13:14.251 --> 13:17.588
No, nothing new.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.173
I see.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.216
Silverfang.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.133
Hm?

13:21.217 --> 13:23.844
Why did you let Garou get away?

13:24.428 --> 13:27.097
Did a monster really intervene?

13:27.181 --> 13:30.809
Are you saying I let him go on purpose?

13:32.144 --> 13:36.023
Sorry… There's so much going on,
I'm a bit confused.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.693
I'll have a staff member
bring you a new transmitter.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.487
Please wait here.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.116
They don't trust you.

13:46.200 --> 13:50.204
Maybe they think you held back
and failed to finish him off.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.373
I didn't hold back.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.085
Good. Looks like no one's following me.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.796
For now, I'll hide in this room.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.131
But how am I gonna get out of here?

14:01.215 --> 14:02.424
What're you doing?

14:03.175 --> 14:04.885
Why are you here, Bang?

14:04.969 --> 14:09.056
I had some business to tend to.
Why are you here?

14:09.139 --> 14:11.976
There was an emergency summons
for Class-S heroes,

14:12.059 --> 14:14.186
and I was brought here too…

14:14.270 --> 14:17.231
What? No one told me.

14:17.314 --> 14:20.776
Oops… I wasn't supposed
to tell Bang about this…

14:20.860 --> 14:24.864
Oh come on…
You and I shared a hot pot together.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.323
Spill it.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.120
King's taking a long time in the bathroom.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.080
His engine was revving pretty hard,

14:33.163 --> 14:35.916
so maybe he's just trying
to focus on his own.

14:37.293 --> 14:40.504
You're storming
the Monster Association's hideout?

14:40.588 --> 14:42.590
So that's what's happening…

14:43.340 --> 14:48.429
And yet, both Genos and I were left out.
I guess they don't trust us.

14:48.971 --> 14:53.100
They took a child hostage? Damn brutes.

14:53.183 --> 14:57.313
We were so focused on tracking Garou,
we didn't even catch the news.

14:57.396 --> 15:02.151
Does Saitama know that
the enemy hideout is in the ghost town?

15:02.234 --> 15:03.736
No, I don't think so…

15:03.819 --> 15:06.530
If he knew, I'm sure he would've
already gone by himself.

15:06.614 --> 15:10.409
From here, the team will move
into the ruins of City Z,

15:10.492 --> 15:13.287
each entering from their own route.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.247
But there's something
I want to ask you.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.458
Silverfang, Bomb.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.377
How about we take Caped Baldy
and Demon Cyborg along

15:20.461 --> 15:23.923
and secretly slip in
through my entry route?

15:24.006 --> 15:26.926
It would go against
the Association's orders though…

15:27.009 --> 15:29.345
Garou will be there, right?

15:29.428 --> 15:31.096
We'll go with you.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.849
All right.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.852
Just like yesterday,
we'll meet up at Saitama's place.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.520
Okay.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.522
See you later.

15:41.607 --> 15:45.569
<i>Oh, thank god. What a relief.</i>

15:46.320 --> 15:50.366
Oh, King's back. Did something happen?

15:50.449 --> 15:52.618
No, no problem at all.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.162
<i>The King Engine has stopped.</i>

15:55.245 --> 15:57.122
<i>He must've sharpened his focus.</i>

15:58.123 --> 15:59.583
All right, let's head out.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.293
Is everyone ready?

16:01.919 --> 16:02.836
Let's go!!

16:12.846 --> 16:15.683
<i>I was summoned to join the assault team,</i>

16:15.766 --> 16:18.602
<i>but for some reason,</i>
<i>they pulled me out at the last minute.</i>

16:18.686 --> 16:20.729
<i>I was told to stay out of this matter.</i>

16:21.355 --> 16:24.066
<i>I bet Tornado's the one who shut me out.</i>

16:24.149 --> 16:25.192
No!

16:25.275 --> 16:28.112
<i>She will never acknowledge me, will she?</i>

16:28.195 --> 16:31.240
<i>I have a personal score</i>
<i>to settle with the Monster Association.</i>

16:31.323 --> 16:35.035
<i>How dare they humiliate me</i>
<i>in front of my sister like that.</i>

16:36.286 --> 16:39.748
<i>Steady point-gathering</i>
<i>and continuous activity</i>

16:39.832 --> 16:42.042
<i>used to be</i>
<i>the Blizzard Bunch's strength.</i>

16:42.126 --> 16:46.046
<i>But because of them,</i>
<i>our operations have been put on hold.</i>

16:52.219 --> 16:53.887
<i>I'll get my revenge.</i>

16:53.971 --> 16:56.473
<i>With the power of the New Blizzard Bunch.</i>

17:00.310 --> 17:03.605
<i>I gave Dr. Kuseno a hard time</i>
<i>with my unreasonable request,</i>

17:03.689 --> 17:08.068
<i>but following Master's advice,</i>
<i>I had him increase my power even more.</i>

17:08.152 --> 17:11.196
<i>This upgrade is pretty reckless.</i>

17:11.280 --> 17:14.783
<i>A terribly unbalanced,</i>
<i>attack-specialized boost.</i>

17:14.867 --> 17:19.663
<i>I boosted the horsepower to the limit</i>
<i>without reducing the armor.</i>

17:19.747 --> 17:23.083
<i>You'll have to fight while controlling</i>
<i>that power yourself.</i>

17:23.167 --> 17:27.963
<i>If you go full power, the parts will</i>
<i>exceed their endurance and break.</i>

17:28.047 --> 17:32.718
<i>It's strictly a last resort…</i>
<i>Ten seconds is the limit.</i>

17:32.801 --> 17:35.596
<i>Any more than that,</i>
<i>your body won't withstand.</i>

17:35.679 --> 17:37.848
<i>If your energy core explodes,</i>

17:37.931 --> 17:41.226
<i>even though you are a cyborg,</i>
<i>you could die.</i>

17:41.810 --> 17:46.231
<i>You got that, Genos?</i>
<i>Full power will only last ten seconds.</i>

17:46.315 --> 17:48.400
<i>Don't forget that.</i>

17:51.153 --> 17:52.029
Oh.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.742
What do you want now?

17:56.825 --> 17:59.828
Don't think you can visit
whenever you like.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.332
Oh, please. You're around
all the time too, aren't you?

18:03.415 --> 18:05.292
You don't get to complain.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.587
I have the right as Master's disciple.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.673
Besides, I'm paying my share of the rent.

18:11.757 --> 18:15.886
Rent? Saitama isn't even
the owner of this apartment.

18:15.969 --> 18:19.723
He's just living here without permission.
You're getting scammed.

18:20.390 --> 18:24.186
Anyway, haven't you heard anything
from the Association yet?

18:24.269 --> 18:25.813
They've already contacted me.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.566
One of the executive's son has
been taken hostage,

18:29.650 --> 18:32.152
so I feel like they should have
made a move already.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.780
But maybe they haven't
located the hideout?

18:34.863 --> 18:38.742
If we knew, Master Saitama would've
wiped them all out by now.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.036
I'm back from getting repairs.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.579
We're here, Saitama.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.207
We can finally have a strategy meeting…

18:46.041 --> 18:48.085
Oh? He's not here.

18:48.168 --> 18:51.213
But the discount sale he's targeting
is the day after tomorrow.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.132
Did he tell you anything?

18:53.215 --> 18:56.009
His hero suit is gone too.
Maybe something happened.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.931
Yo! We're back, Saitama.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.558
Master is not here.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.853
Hm? Not here? That's too bad.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.691
We were just about to raid
the monsters' hideout with King.

19:10.774 --> 19:13.986
What? So you've located
the Monster Association's hideout?

19:14.069 --> 19:16.572
Apparently, it's right nearby.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.574
Right under our noses, as they say.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.702
You're coming too, won't you, Genos?

19:21.785 --> 19:22.995
Of course.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.042
I somehow managed to get out.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.712
Oh, there you are, King.

19:32.504 --> 19:35.007
Oh…Hi…

19:36.425 --> 19:38.135
Looks like everyone's here.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.179
Saitama's not here though.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.638
What? No way!

19:41.722 --> 19:44.725
But we don't have any time left
before the attack begins…

19:44.808 --> 19:46.810
So what do we do, King?

19:46.894 --> 19:48.937
Do we wait for Saitama to come back?

19:49.021 --> 19:50.981
Or do we go in without him?

19:51.064 --> 19:53.942
RUMBLE RUMBLE

19:54.026 --> 19:55.819
We wait for Saitama.

19:56.361 --> 20:00.282
If this is going to be an all-out battle,
we need Saitama's strength.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.783
I gotta hand it to you, King.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.286
You already made plans behind the scenes.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.747
If we're going, then we all go.

20:06.830 --> 20:10.500
All of the members of
this New Blizzard Bunch together, right?

20:10.584 --> 20:11.793
So what should we do?

20:12.836 --> 20:15.380
Hey you! Don't ignore me!

20:15.464 --> 20:21.220
Hey, are you listening!
Look at me! Hey!

20:21.303 --> 20:25.807
King's delay only increases
the burden on the other Class-S heroes.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.309
You guys go on ahead.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.311
I will wait for Master.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.271
Once he returns, we'll join the raid.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.981
Sounds like a plan.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.359
<i>What? We're going without Saitama?</i>

20:35.442 --> 20:37.027
<i>Are you serious?</i>

20:37.778 --> 20:39.238
All right, let's go.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.406
Let's finish this before sundown.

20:41.490 --> 20:45.035
Follow me!
The New Blizzard Bunch, head out!

20:45.118 --> 20:46.828
RUMBLE RUMBLE

20:46.912 --> 20:48.455
<i>I'm not sure about this…</i>

20:52.125 --> 20:55.045
<i>Saitama, where did you go?</i>

22:32.642 --> 22:33.769
We've arrived.

22:37.814 --> 22:40.484
Hm? Where's King?

22:40.567 --> 22:42.194
He should've been at the rear.

22:42.277 --> 22:44.362
I saw him running off.

22:44.446 --> 22:48.533
I'm gonna get to my position early,
so don't worry about me.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.995
Everyone should stick to
your scheduled timing for the assault.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.205
That's what he said.

22:53.288 --> 22:57.417
<i>He acts on his own like it's nothing.</i>

22:57.501 --> 22:59.586
<i>Why didn't he tell me directly?</i>

23:00.629 --> 23:02.923
<i>Am I still being treated like a kid?</i>

23:03.006 --> 23:08.053
He acts fast. That's just how he is.

23:08.136 --> 23:11.473
I was hoping to see King
in action up close.

23:11.556 --> 23:12.682
What a shame.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.519
He has his own way of doing things.

23:15.602 --> 23:16.436
Yeah.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.354
Hey…

23:17.896 --> 23:19.689
Check out what's ahead.

23:20.357 --> 23:23.276
Looks like they're rolling out
the welcome party for us.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.779
Whoa… They just keep showing up.

23:25.862 --> 23:29.241
Master Atomic, I sense them behind us too.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.993
Not just behind us.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.462
<i>An old rag…?</i>

23:46.842 --> 23:48.718
Well, well…

23:48.802 --> 23:50.428
Oh my…

23:50.512 --> 23:54.266
I heard the Hero Association was
sending in its full fighting force,

23:54.349 --> 23:56.059
but this is it?

23:56.935 --> 24:01.857
COUNTERSTRIKE
