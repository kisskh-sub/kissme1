00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.120
This is dereliction of duty.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.880
This is an imperial exam candidate
from Ling An.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.040
A crime must be determined.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.920
Midnight.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.760
That's the time for changing shifts.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.000
They struck when the guards
were less vigilant.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.000
Then this matter

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.600
was aimed directly at Father.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.400
General Nan,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.320
do you have anything to say?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.480
I...

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.120
General Nan.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.400
Liu Zhi, Metropolitan Governor.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.120
I come to Your Majesty
to confess my guilt.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.560
Liu, my loyal subject,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.480
what crime do you confess to?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.920
Your Majesty,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.920
as Metropolitan Governor,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.480
I am responsible for the capital's security.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.880
General Nan's guard area
is near the palace.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.920
The candidates' safety is my duty.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.280
It was I

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.560
who neglected the posthouse's defense.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.800
I ask

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.920
Your Majesty to punish me.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.920
Lord Liu,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.760
even if you take all the blame,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.280
upon yourself,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.640
you can't clear Nan Hongyi.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.480
Your Majesty,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.600
I believe

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.920
the priority is not assigning blame,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.440
but finding the true culprit
behind the attack.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.880
We must give them justice.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.240
We must find the culprit
and assign responsibility.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.360
These two tasks do not conflict.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.480
I believe...

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.120
Enough.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.360
This matter concerns your father-in-law.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.520
Lord Rui, you should avoid suspicion.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.040
You can't act recklessly
just because of your bond
with His Majesty.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.480
and do as you please.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.280
Although

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.400
relations between civil and military
have eased,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.000
the teacher remains neutral.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.040
But in such a major matter,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.800
only Liu Zhi and I

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.120
will speak up for Father.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.360
This matter

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.960
is my dereliction of duty.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.920
I am willing to bear it alone.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.680
It concerns no one else.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.160
Lord Liu,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.560
Enough.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.400
Remove Liu Zhi

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.960
from the post of Metropolitan Governor.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.880
Demote him to County Magistrate
of Jiao Zhou.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.520
Retain his fourth-rank status.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.200
Grant him a jade seal.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.960
He shall serve as inspector.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.760
Report border affairs monthly.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.800
If emergencies arise,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.360
he may act first, report later.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.440
I...

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.880
accept the decree.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.880
Quick, open it!

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.200
Hurry!

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.040
Herbal medicine.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.040
There should be no danger
to his life.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.680
Who injured him?

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.360
I'm not sure either.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.600
When I was heading to the village
to buy supplies,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.640
I saw several men trapped
in a formation.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.840
My junior staggered out
from the formation.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.920
One of them wore a uniform

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.160
similar to my junior's.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.200
That uniform is Wu Rong style.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.400
His wound

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.280
looks like it was made
by a Western Border scimitar.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.120
He must have escaped
from the border.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.200
Before I went up the mountain,
Lord Rui said my junior
was sent on a mission.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.160
But with his status,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.120
what could he do alone
outside the capital?

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.120
We'll only know everything
when he wakes up.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.000
I'm familiar with this pass.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.200
I once traveled thousands of miles
to take the exam in the capital.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.960
Hoping to make a name

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.640
for myself in that city.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.320
But after entering officialdom,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.760
I saw the court's intrigues.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.760
So I chose a moderate life.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.000
To protect myself wisely.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.880
Fortunately,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.560
I met you.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.760
I feel

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.960
I can finally fulfill my ideals
and ambitions.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.480
To rid the country of traitors
with you.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.840
How exhilarating.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.720
But I was still too naive.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.680
Those candidates' careers

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.520
were ruined just like that.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.000
Just as they emerged
from years of hard study,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.840
they fell victim to factional strife.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.560
How tragic.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.760
I promised to protect you,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.680
but caused your exile
from the capital.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.240
I'm sorry.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.000
Lord Rui,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.160
this matter

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.720
please don't take it to heart.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.160
For our nation's prosperity,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.520
balance between civil and military
is essential.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.440
Just like the exam question
you set before.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
The way to secure the nation
and its army.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.840
My ideal

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.120
is to see Ling An flourish one day.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.080
So military officers must not
bear the blame.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.240
Otherwise,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.200
everything we've done

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.000
all our efforts will be wasted.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.720
So,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.560
this is the best outcome.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.760
I'll consider it

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.840
as self-exile.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.920
I'll first see the world
Your Majesty governs.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880
My Ling An

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.920
must have vast mountains and rivers,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.640
and endless skies and lands.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.320
It's getting late.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.320
Lord Rui,

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.560
please stay.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.360
Lord Liu,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.880
take care.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.400
Lord Rui,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.680
take care.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.760
I'm leaving.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.920
I'm sorry.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.000
Truly, I'm so sorry.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:49.920
Rui Yu

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.600
Rui Yu

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.720
Rui Yu

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.600
Lord

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.480
What's wrong?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.000
It's nothing.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.320
Let's head back to the residence.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.560
Has the young master sent a letter yet?

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.120
No.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.200
If he does send a letter,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.240
I'll deliver it right away

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.840
to the General's residence.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.720
That's not what I meant.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.040
Lord

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.440
Why are you returning home?

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.120
Lord

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.600
I still need to deliver the list to the palace.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.480
Lord, please take a break.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.680
You haven't rested properly for over a month.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:37.960
No.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.320
We must announce the results soon.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.040
We can't afford any more trouble.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.200
Lord, Lord!

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.040
Junior brother

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.280
Elder master

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.080
Senior sister

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.360
How did I end up here?

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.720
You were chased up the mountain by people from the Western Border.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.000
You fainted outside the town.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.640
You were smart

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.240
to head for the mountain when trouble came.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.160
I really couldn't shake them off.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.120
I couldn't lead them into the city.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.480
By the way,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.200
how are things in the city?

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.120
How are Rui Yu and my parents?

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.640
I've been up here for a long time.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.600
I don't really know what's happening in the city.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.360
No.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.960
I need to get down the mountain quickly.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.920
Rui Yu must be worried about me.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920
You're still injured.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:58.800
Darn it.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.600
I'm fine.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.040
Master

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.360
He just woke up and you knocked him out again, Master.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.640
Enough with the chatter.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.800
You're not allowed down the mountain either.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.840
What if someone tries to harm Chen Xiao in the city?

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.480
His identity is special.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.960
Wait until he's fully recovered.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.640
No rush for now.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.080
Got it.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.120
Your Majesty

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.000
Rui Yu

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.920
The attack on the imperial examination candidates

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.360
has been suppressed for now.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.320
Here are the new top three exam papers

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.160
and

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.800
the list for tomorrow's announcement.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.680
They're not as ideal as those three,

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.080
but they're still outstanding.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.640
I expect this spring imperial exam

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.560
will produce many promising talents.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.800
I heard

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.760
that day

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.360
you fainted after seeing off Lord Liu.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.040
It's just

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.080
a bit of exhaustion.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.240
Your Majesty need not worry.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.120
In that case,

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.880
after this spring exam ends,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.120
I grant you ten days of rest at home.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:25.840
Unless summoned,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.920
you need not attend court.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.720
Please allow me to keep working.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.840
Otherwise, I always

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.360
feel uneasy inside.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.000
It's time to find a quiet place to calm your mind.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.040
Come with me out of the city.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.840
This old man

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.920
at his age

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.440
still hits so hard.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.720
Are you alright?

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.520
I'm fine.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.560
Just a minor injury.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.400
It's nothing serious.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.840
Where's Elder Master?

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.280
He went to the village to fix someone's waterwheel.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.440
Then I need to hurry down the mountain.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.760
No.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.840
Lie down quickly.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.920
You're still injured.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.440
If you want to say something,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.480
I'll find a chance tomorrow

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.840
to go down and deliver your message.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.280
When you go down,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.440
find Yu'er first.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.880
While I've been away,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.240
she's been taking care of the family.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.800
Coordinate with her

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.440
so our parents won't worry.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.200
Don't worry.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.440
I'll pass on your message.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.440
Then tell Yu'er

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.440
I'm fine.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.640
Let her know not to worry.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.360
I'll be able to leave the mountain soon

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.600
and return to her side.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.080
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.160
Why do I feel

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.680
that whenever you mention Lord Rui,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.960
you have a certain

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.920
indescribable feeling.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.680
Yu'er is actually a woman.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.960
What?

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.280
You mean she's

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.440
And you two are...

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.760
Oh my gosh.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.640
What's going on here?

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.000
It's all thanks to Your Majesty's blessed match.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.800
Alright, stop showing off.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.040
Get some rest.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.040
I'll find a chance tomorrow to deliver your message.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.360
Thank you, senior sister.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.960
Cover yourself with the blanket.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:10.960
Rest well.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:17.880
Prince

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:18.800
Father

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.880
Today, you

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.360
Why didn't you visit the Empress Dowager?

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.040
The Empress Dowager is meditating lately.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.280
It's not good for me to disturb her.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.160
Then go see the Princess.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.720
You should meet with Your Majesty more often.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.920
So your marriage to the throne can be settled soon.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.120
Get it decided.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.120
I understand.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.320
Sit down.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.360
I've received word

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.320
Pingxiang merchants will arrive in the capital soon.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.960
If this deal goes wrong in the capital,

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.680
it could disrupt

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.360
the alliance between Pingxiang and Ling An.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.600
The timing is perfect.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.600
About the imperial exam candidate,

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.120
we've brought down Liu Zhi.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.280
Nan Hongyi may be unharmed,

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.560
but once prejudice is sown,

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.840
it's not easily removed.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.360
Prime Minister Ming,

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.240
are you

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.720
trying to seize the capital garrison?

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.800
The Pingxiang deal

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.320
is handled by the Rui family.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.480
Aren't you afraid,

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.640
your aunt will be implicated?

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.520
Those who achieve greatness don't fuss over details.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.520
She's just an aunt.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.880
If the Rui family blocks your way,

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.960
then I

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.560
will help you vent your anger.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.920
Then I'll wait and see.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.880
It feels like we've just been here.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.880
Are we lost?

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.000
Last time you

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.480
came up the mountain, when was it?

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.040
When you went to Pingxiang last time,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.120
I came up to gather herbs for my mother.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.040
Why does it feel

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.360
like the trees are arranged differently now?

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.160
This must be Mr. Yu's protective formation.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.880
It's meant to confuse intruders.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.920
Without a Path Guide,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.440
you could be trapped here.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.880
Then last time you came up,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.440
why didn't you remember Miss Qiao's way to break the formation?

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.360
Last time, I was in a hurry.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.280
I was focused on finding medicine for my mother.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.520
So,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.320
I do remember this path.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:08.920
Let's go.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:09.800
Yes.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.360
Let's go.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.000
Master

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.560
Looks like it'll rain in a few days.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.720
I'll go pick some vegetables to prepare.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.640
And catch a pheasant.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.760
To help your junior recover.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.120
Got it.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.600
I'll go with Youyi.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.600
Master

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.280
Can't you be a bit gentler?

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.920
Don't think I didn't see you two sneaking around.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.720
No leaving the mountain.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.880
Be back within one hour.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.880
Where are we, really?

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.680
I remember taking this path last time.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.440
I don't think we've walked this way before.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:47.920
Miss Qiao

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.440
Lord Rui

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.560
You all

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.840
Why are you here?

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.760
Your Majesty has something to say to you.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:16.720
I

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:17.760
Lord Rui

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.080
Come with me.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.880
I have something important to tell you.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.640
You'd better hurry, Your Majesty.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.640
It's fine.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.000
Careful.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.960
It's fine, really.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:33.920
Slow down.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.040
Are you okay?

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.440
This is the place.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.640
Everyone, come in quickly.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:56.400
Slow down.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.720
It's been half an hour already.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.240
Why are you only back now?

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.720
Finally done.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.040
Senior Sister

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.200
Yu'er

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.600
Chen Xiao

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.640
Yu'er

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.800
Chen Xiao

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.200
Chen Xiao

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:41.720
Yu'er

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.800
Yu'er

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.200
Nan Chenxiao

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.680
You're still alive!

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.000
What are you doing?

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.200
Treating my place like an inn?

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.200
Elder Master

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.480
This is my Elder Master.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.400
Yu Qingxuan

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.560
Greetings, Mr. Yu.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.400
You again?

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.800
Your mother's illness—

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.960
Still not cured?

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.480
Mr. Yu

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.920
I'm here to see Miss Qiao.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.160
Have you finished talking?

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.960
If so, you can leave the mountain.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.600
Not yet.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.200
Miss Qiao

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.440
I haven't finished picking vegetables.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.080
I'll go with you, then.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:28.880
Miss Qiao

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.240
Let's go catch some fish too.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.800
It might rain today.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.320
We still need to feed everyone.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.440
Let's go.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.000
No need to follow.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.480
Hurry up.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.440
Why are you all just standing there?

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.400
If they say not to follow, then don't.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.080
Didn't you hear what they said?

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.000
We have so many mouths to feed.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.680
Go hunt something, quickly.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.880
I don't keep idlers here.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.120
Your foot is injured.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.440
Rest for now.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.400
But Mr. Yu said he doesn't keep idlers.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.200
If I don't work, I won't get to eat.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:15.800
It's fine.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.640
I'll do your share too.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.320
Hurry up.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.480
I'll go catch a rabbit.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.720
I'm glad you're okay.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.200
Sorry to make you worry.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:13.960
Since I was young,

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.360
I've never had anything I especially wanted to do.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.880
Nor anyone I especially wanted to be close to.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.640
Every day was just study and official duties.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.200
That day, you said

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.000
you wanted us to be a real married couple.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.960
I don't know what to do.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.480
Or

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.400
what I can do.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.280
But now,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.360
I understand my heart.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.000
Rui'er,

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.960
I want to hold on to you.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.920
I will never let go.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.360
Are you all right?

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.880
Miss Qiao, I have something to tell you.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.640
I just want to say a few words.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.480
I just want to know why you're avoiding me.
