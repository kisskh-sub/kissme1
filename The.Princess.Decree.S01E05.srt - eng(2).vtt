Sorry, sir. I'll bring you a clean change
of clothes immediately.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:37.239
Please.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.640
Yuanze.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.799
Did you find out why she left in a rush?

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:55.879
Yes.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.959
But...

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.560
Xiao Pingning abducted
the bookseller Zhou

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.359
to find Mr. Qingya.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.719
She even threatened him,

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.719
saying Zhou's life would be at risk
if Mr. Qingya didn't go to the meeting.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.879
Xiao Pingning is truly evil.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.000
This has nothing to do with Zhou.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.039
I cannot involve
innocent people anymore.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.159
But will this

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.240
make her figure out your identity?

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.360
Better to take this chance

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.319
and leave.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.199
I'll find a way to rescue Zhou.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.680
She kept me

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.680
to see how we react.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.360
Moreover,

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.840
I cannot leave yet.

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:37.319
What do we do then?

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:51.759
Song, take off your clothes.

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.000
Yuanze.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.599
Let's swap clothes.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.960
Later, sit there in my place.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.800
Call it a brief nap after drinking.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.639
No one must disturb you.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.919
Yuanze.

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.919
I don't understand.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.360
Why won't you explain to Princess Royal?

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.280
You were helpless back then.

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.280
He's deceased.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.479
Why add blame to Mr. Liu again?

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:16.240
Moreover,

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.680
even with countless reasons,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.439
what happened has happened.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.400
No argument can change that.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.159
Alright.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.639
Yuanze.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.520
Take care of yourself.

(Princess Royal Yong'an's Residence)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.599
He really hasn't returned.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.000
Were you looking for me?

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.800
I got drunk at noon

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.080
and rested a while at Lin Residence.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.199
Besides,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.079
the lives of my fellow disciples
depend on you.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.480
Do I even have another choice?

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:29.800
Official Li.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.120
You're so obedient.

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.399
(Chi Yan, Beijiang's Eldest Prince)
That battle with Jing

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.360
left me a cripple.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.600
Even if you have a good figure,

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:09.920
what use is it to me?

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:19.079
Don't you love cleanliness?

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:20.639
I'll help you wash up.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.900
(Qingya and White Deer)

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.000
Your Highness.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.360
Your Highness.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.500
(Qingya and White Deer)

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.800
Official Li, please leave.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.759
Xing, why is she acting this way?

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.199
Why pretend?

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.079
Can't you imagine what Her Highness

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:42.319
will face in Beijiang?

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.360
She now fears the rain,

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.079
thunder, and the dark.

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:48.480
It's all your fault.

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:58.680
You're acting like this now.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.240
Where were you five years ago?

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:09.279
If you still have a shred of conscience,

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:12.720
spare Her Highness.

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.879
Don't come closer. No.

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:22.879
Five years in Beijiang,
surrounded by ice and frost.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.480
It helped me survive.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.740
(Qingya and White Deer)

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.639
Your Highness, you're awake.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:09.639
Xing.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.639
Mr. Qingya

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:13.120
seems unwilling to interact with me.

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:17.319
But my name is notorious now,

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.279
so it's normal.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.959
If nothing's on,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.360
we shouldn't disturb him.

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:29.600
But if he's in trouble,

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:32.080
make sure to tell me.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.759
Your Highness, Li Yuanze

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.519
stood outside all night last night.

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:46.759
He can't change his habit

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.519
of being a living saint.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.919
Yesterday, Princess Royal
attacked Prince Zhennan's mansion,

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:05.480
releasing the concubines inside.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.250
His Majesty was furious and ordered her
to apologize to His Highness.

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:09.320
She refused.

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:10.279
Prince Zhennan

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.919
is truly not a good man.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.200
He's known to be violent,

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.600
often abusing his concubines,

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:16.320
causing many deaths.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.879
You cannot say that.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.720
Prince Zhennan protects the borders.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.039
So what if he has some small quirks?

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.879
Now is the time for military action.

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:25.440
Princess Royal's actions

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:27.000
shows her lack of discretion.

00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:30.559
This woman is shortsighted after all.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.200
Let's go.

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:57.159
What?

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:59.240

Your Highness, bad news!

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:11.759
Official Li is in trouble.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.879
What?

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.399
(Li Residence)

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.279
Li Yuanze!

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.480
Li Yuanze.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.480
Li Yuanze, are you seeking death?

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:30.759
You openly impeached
Prince Zhennan in court.

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:31.080
He...

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:31.660
Your Highness.

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:37.679
How could someone

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.440
of such character
bear the responsibility of a general?

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.840
Relying on such rats

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:45.039
would be Jing's shame.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.320
That old Liu Zhen

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:52.320
is your mentor, but he doesn't even
put in a good word for you.

00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:53.799
He even struck so hard.

00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:56.200
Mr. Liu did it to protect me.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.360
He got angry first.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.879
His Majesty cannot punish me.

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:04.360
I...

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:06.639
I just don't understand

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.799
why I

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:09.279
can't intervene in this matter.

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:13.440
Could it be

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.759
that being a canary,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.960
living a life of luxury

00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:20.720
and hoping to find the perfect husband

00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:22.000
is the right path?

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.120
Your Highness.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.240
I was presumptuous.

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:45.100
To me,

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.900
you have never been a caged bird.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.980
You care for the world

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.220
like a phoenix rising to greatness.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.660
How is that wrong?

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:57.940
Moreover,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.900
this is the most precious crown

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.260
of being Princess Royal.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.840
The kingdom, its people,

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.780
and their welfare,

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.020
are already connected to your blood.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.100
Even if your wings are not yet full,

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.540
one day,

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.140
the people

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.140
