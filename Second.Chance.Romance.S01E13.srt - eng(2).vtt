[Episode 13]

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.540
Do you think Zheng Yufan
can win an award?

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.820
It seems unlikely.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.570
I've seen her rehearse.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.100
She's fallen at the same spot
several times.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.540
It's been like this for days.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.540
Wasn't she doing well before?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.820
Guess everyone has their limits.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.660
Increasing the difficulty

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.130
isn't necessarily a good thing.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.410
Let's go.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.020
Go.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.130
Ms. Zhuang,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.170
I'm sorry.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.850
I want to drop out.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.850
Ms. Tan,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.570
you had such high hopes for me.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.170
Sorry to disappoint you.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.730
Yufan,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.940
we all want what's best for you.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.380
If you think it's harder

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.820
because I changed the piece,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.130
I hope you can trust me.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.260
You can do this.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.850
It's not about you.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.380
It's my own problem.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.380
Yufan,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.690
I know you're under a lot of pressure.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.170
But don't rush.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.060
We can solve any problem together.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.260
Don't try to talk me out of it,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.730
Ms. Guan.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.610
I've really made up my mind this time.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.170
Thank you

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.170
for all your care and support.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.170
I've let you down.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.060
Sorry.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.260
Yufan.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.170
Ms. Guan.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.940
Don't go after her. Let her go.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.820
But Ms. Zhuang,

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.690
are we just letting her leave like this?

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.170
Yufan,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.060
you dance so well.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.290
Why are you quitting?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.260
Do I dance well?

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.820
Qu Zhen,

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.500
you must keep dancing.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.820
I hope to see you on stage someday.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.170
How nice.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.940
Dancing makes you happy.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.820
What's wrong?

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.570
You seem down.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.260
No.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.170
Work issues?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.690
Oh my.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.820
Be careful.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.250
Slow down.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.170
It smells amazing.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.050
This is such a feast.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.290
I had hot pot with you a few times.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.700
I basically got

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:28.370
all your favorites here.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.050
Go wash your hands.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.610
Let's eat.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.050
Tasty, right?

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.810
You still need to eat properly.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.050
There's nothing

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.700
a hot pot meal can't fix.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.290
When we were kids,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.170
I loved watching you eat.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.460
Seeing you enjoy your food so much

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.930
always made me eat more too.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.930
You've been talking
the whole time, hardly eating.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.700
Let me get some for you...

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.930
Who is it?

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.580
Who?

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.930
Shuhan?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.170
So you're here.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.930
I wondered who was having hot pot here.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.170
I could smell it from outside.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.810
Here.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:08.580
You didn't need to buy anything.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.580
Our place has everything.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.290
Our place?

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.700
This is Tan Siting's place.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.170
Get her a seat.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.050
There's enough food.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.460
Even if there wasn't, I'd still eat.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.290
Sit here.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.810
Don't sit so close to her.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.290
Might bump her foot later.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.700
Here.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.930
I haven't visited lately.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.930
How is

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.580
your recovery?

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.580
It's good.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.050
Just following the doctor's orders.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.460
No discomfort now.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.460
Just waiting to heal gradually.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.170
Listen, a serious bone injury
needs a long time to heal.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.810
Make sure you're recovered
before going back to school.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.810
The school can wait.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.580
No.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.930
I still teach my students every day.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.460
You know what?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.290
It's pretty funny now.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.930
I teach sitting in a chair

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.700
every day.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.290
It makes me feel like a professor.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.170
You are a professor.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.540
You know, a girl at our school

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.930
asked,

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.290
"What does Mr. Wang do for a living?"

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.580
You know what I told her about Yuan?

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.290
What did you say?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.050
I said he's in homemaking services.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.170
He does look the part.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.580
Siting, let me tell you,

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.460
my brother is like your brother.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.930
If you need anything, just call him.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.170
I know.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.580
He's like a brother to me.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.340
Wang Zeyuan,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.410
let me ask you something.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.020
If I

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.170
broke my leg one day,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.170
would you take care of me like this too?

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:23.810
You're overthinking it.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.290
Can we not talk
about such unlucky things?

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.700
But just to be clear,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.930
if you really broke your leg,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.810
I'd take care of you.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.170
See?

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.340
That's what sisters are for.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.930
And we're siblings.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.930
You ungrateful brat.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.290
Where's the meat?

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.170
Don't take that piece of meat.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.810
It's overcooked.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.050
I'll put in new ones for you.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.460
I...

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.290
I can't eat this much anymore, Yuan.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.780
I've definitely gained weight lately.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.580
Should I get some for you too?

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.930
Don't bother.
I don't accept pity offerings.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.930
But Tan Siting,

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.930
you should watch out.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.290
You have gained a bit of weight.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.700
I noticed as soon as I walked in,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.290
I'm telling you.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.340
She hasn't.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.660
Don't overthink it.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.580
I'm telling you,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.410
after I recover,
I'll have gained weight for sure.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.170
Yuan, I...

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.540
I bet I won't even fit
into my dresses anymore.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.810
You look better with more weight.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.050
Stop brainwashing her, okay?

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.540
She's a ballet dancer.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.810
How can she dance if she gains weight?

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.050
Can she still do ballet
if she looks like me?

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.980
More like a bouncing bomb.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.930
She could be the first.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.930
Have a drink.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.580
Can you drink?

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.170
Cheers.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.290
Cheers.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.170
To a speedy recovery.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:33.930
Look at you, so pathetic.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.290
I couldn't even drag you away.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.810
Are you available later?

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:41.580
Why?

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.700
Nothing.
Have a couple of drinks with me.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.050
I can keep you company.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.170
But I won't drink.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.290
Yuan,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.440
have a drink with me.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.880
If you want to talk

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.000
about Siting and me,

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.270
don't bother.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:05.980
I'm not a minor.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.930
I'll take responsibility
for my own actions.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.700
And

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.540
if Mom, Dad, or you

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.410
disagree because of what some relatives

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:16.700
or neighbors think,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.850
then please tell them

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.810
that we live our lives for ourselves.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.780
Their idea of respectability

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.460
means nothing to me.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.810
You're pretty clever, huh.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.050
You knew I called you here to talk.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.060
But that's not what I wanted to discuss.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.060
I want to tell you

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.940
that a relationship
is between two people.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.060
My opinion

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:37.940
and our parents' opinions

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.180
don't matter.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.490
Your own happiness is what matters.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.300
You don't believe me?

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.490
I know how you feel about Tan Siting.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.940
And I know

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.370
you've liked her

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.420
since you were very young.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.060
Right?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.060
I did start liking Siting
a long time ago.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.300
I like her independence.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.370
I like her courage.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.820
And I like how she gives her all

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.060
for her dreams.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.060
Sometimes

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.940
I even feel like
I'm not good enough for her.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.250
But other times

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.490
I feel we're quite alike.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.420
Both are working hard

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.370
to create our own futures.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.700
I understand

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.100
everything you're saying.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.300
But let me ask you one thing.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.060
Are you ready

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.820
to be a dad?

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.300
Tan Siting's child is alive.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.300
It's the child

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.300
we thought died twelve years ago.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.820
He's alive.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.770
Feng Rui raised him.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.890
And Tan Siting

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.340
went for a paternity test
a couple of days ago.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.890
It is indeed her child

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.770
from twelve years ago.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.850
When she told me about this,

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:01.770
I was as shocked as you are.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.890
It's really funny.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.890
Like something out of a TV drama.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.420
So, regardless of your relationship,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.060
are you ready to be a dad?

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.890
I'll say it again.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.610
I don't care.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.250
Yuan,

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.580
you're my brother.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.490
Siting is my good friend.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.420
I hope you both can be happy.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.850
Anyway, I've told you now.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.650
Be prepared.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:08.860
Class is over.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.540
Stand up.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.060
Good.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.260
Relax.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:13.700
Yes.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.460
Continue.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.580
Watch your expression.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.180
Good.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.020
Put feeling into your hands.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:32.900
Feet.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.820
Untightened. Good.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.140
Yes.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.340
Control.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.060
Go.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.220
I'm at Cabin Bar.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.700

I'm at Cabin Bar.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.370

I'm at Cabin Bar.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:47.530

Why is everyone leaving?

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.380
Why did they all leave?

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:26.860
Going home.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.700
Get me

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.220
another round.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.380
Here.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:36.900
Another case.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.460
Hurry up.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.860
No one came to drink.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.740
Why isn't anyone replying?

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.700
Hello.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.460
Sorry, but we're closing now.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.380
Hello.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.980
Wh... What?

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.540
We're closing now.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.780
Closing?

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:10.380
Yes.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.260
Okay.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.740
I'll call a cab.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.300
Alright.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.460
I'll leave when the cab arrives.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.540
Wait a moment.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.980
98...

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.340
W?

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:24.980
W.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.140
9...

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.460
4M9...

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.340
9...

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.980
98W.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:46.620
9...

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.100
9...

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.620
Yes, it's you!

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.340
My ride.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.100
Wait a moment.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.740
98W.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:56.980
Open the door!

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.100
Open up.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:06.860
It's my ride.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.620
My ride. 98W.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.140
Let's go.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.060
Stop rocking.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.380
Sir.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.100
Wait a moment.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:32.900
Pull over.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.100
Oh my god.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.060
Rinse your mouth.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.380
No.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:27.700
Don't bother.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.700
You drink it.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.220
You drink it. Thanks.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.380
Let's go.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.340
Home.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.860
Why do you look so familiar?

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.900
Were you in No.11 Middle School?

00:16:59.380 --> 00:16:59.940
Yes.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.100
I've seen you somewhere.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.620
Let me think.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.980
Where did I see you?

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:08.820
Did you play basketball?

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:10.460
Yes.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.100
I knew it!

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.220
I knew you played basketball.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:15.580
Let me think.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.140
Where did I see you?

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:18.660
I remember now.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.140
I went to watch you play basketball.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.900
You used to play basketball often

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.620
at No.11 Middle School, right?

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.860
What's your name again?

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.580
Wu...

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:29.820
Wu Jian...?

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.020
Wu Yanzu?

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.580
Wu something Hao?

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.620
Wu Zuhao.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.420
Yes! Wu Zuhao.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.140
Right. Wu Zuhao.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.900
Don't you remember me?

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.100
I'm Wang Shuhan.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.620
I was pretty famous
at No.11 Middle School too, you know!

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.100
What a coincidence.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.180
The legendary Wang Shuhan!

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.140
What a coincidence it is
to run into you here.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:50.780
It really is a coincidence.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.380
Yeah.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.140
Well,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.140
nice car.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.180
A luxury car, right?

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.860
Why are you driving a luxury car
as a driver?

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.220
No.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.980
I'm quite busy with work during the day.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.180
At night, I just like
to drive around to relax.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.620
I take a ride or two while I'm at it.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.460
I mainly enjoy chatting with people.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.180
Talk about all sorts of things.
It's interesting.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.140
This car is pretty spacious.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.220
Fits a lot of people.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.900
You drive a luxury car just to chat?

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.380
I like chatting too.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.380
But I never expected it
to be such a coincidence.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.620
We must have a good chat today.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.820
You really don't remember me?

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.900
I'm Wang Shuhan.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.580
I remember.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:37.460
Right?

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.580
I knew you'd remember!

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:42.940
What a small world.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.580
Guess we're quite fated.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:47.380
Yes.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.220
Fated.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.220
Wu...

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:51.380
Wu Zuhao.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.300
Wu Zuhao,

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.660
I told you we'd met somewhere before.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:02.620
Quite a coincidence.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.940
This car is comfortable to sit in.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.580
Water.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.580
I'm thirsty.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.580
I want water.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.580
Whose clothes?

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.100
Whose car is it?

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:39.940
The car I called.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:40.460
Yes.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.780
I called it myself.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.580
Phone.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.260
My phone.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.180
Is the ride service this good now?

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.340
Good morning.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.300
You're awake.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.020
Yes.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.020
Well...

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.180
You were sleeping so soundly.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.340
I didn't have the heart to wake you.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:23.580
Yes.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.060
I just

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.780
checked my phone.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.940
You turned off this service.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.100
How do I pay the fare?

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:30.860
It's fine.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.580
We had a great chat along the way.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.020
Besides, we're classmates.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.340
Consider it me taking you for a spin.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.820
As long as you're feeling better,
it's worth it.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.300
Classmates?

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.460
But you should drink less in the future.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:45.740
A girl drinking like that

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.060
isn't very safe.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.060
I'll get going now.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:55.180
Bye.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:55.780
Bye.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.820
Um,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.060
can I

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.540
get your contact info?

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.780
I'll treat you to a meal.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:02.220
Okay.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:08.940
Got it.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.220
Well... I'll head up now then.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:14.380
I'm Wu Zuhao.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:17.780
Okay.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.580
Wu Zuhao, drive safely.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:22.060
Bye.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:22.700
Bye.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.180
The matters in France
have been wrapped up.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.580
They spoke very highly of Cygne.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.940
Thanks to your help, Mr. Wang.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.540
I told you before.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.380
Definitely no problem.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.220
So how do you plan to
thank me this time, Mr. Feng?

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.620
I must thank you properly.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:45.980
By the way,

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.220
Cygne has a wine tasting in a few days.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.820
You must attend.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:51.420
Absolutely no problem.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:52.300
Actually,

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.900
I have an urgent matter today.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.580
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:57.900
Go on.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.500
You remember Cai, right?

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:00.980
I know.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:01.820
Cai.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.700
He signed a new painter.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.340
He invited me to the art exhibition.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.260
Said he's invited successful friends

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.700
from various industries.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.540
Something came up suddenly
on my end.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.580
But I don't want to turn him down.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.460
I was thinking,

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.220
in our industry,

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:14.900
there's only you

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:15.620
who fits the bill as a young talent.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.260
So could you attend in my place?

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.500
I've already spoken to him.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:19.620
I understand.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.060
Cai said

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.620
he's thrilled.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.580
If you can go,

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.260
his exhibition will be elevated.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.820
Now it's just
about scheduling your time.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.780
With the mood set like this,

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.620
of course I must go.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.180
That's wonderful.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:33.060
By the way,

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.620
bring a plus one.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.620
Okay. I'll be there on time.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:49.900
Great.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:58.740
Ms. Wen.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.900
How are the concert preparations going?

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.100
Pretty smoothly.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.060
We're going through the procedures.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.020
Share the process with me
once it's finalized.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.060
My classmate wants to organize one too.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.740
No problem.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.100
I'll let you know once it's done.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.260
I'm so jealous.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.540
You have both love and dreams
in your hands.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.100
I need to take this call.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:21.900
Hello?

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:22.580

[Zu]
Good afternoon.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.700
Hope you're well-rested.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.220
Wanna grab some food together?

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.420
I'll pick you up later.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.220
No rush.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:58.900
Take your time getting ready.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.140
I'm taking you
to a classic old restaurant.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.340
[Shuhan]
Okay.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:20.580
Morning.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:21.260
Morning.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:23.780
Get in.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.540
Oh, okay.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.020
Watch your head.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:33.700
Thanks.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.580
Seatbelt.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.260
Yes. Seatbelt.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.580
Did you sleep...?

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:05.700
Go on.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.740
Nothing. I was just asking
if you slept well.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.140
Pretty well. You?

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.540
Same here.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.420
Where are we going?

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.100
It's a surprise.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.140
You'll know when we get there.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.500
What are you thinking about?

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:35.580
Nothing.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.020
Are you thinking about Zheng?

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.220
With Qu Zhen as your little informant,

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.100
there's nothing at our school
you don't know.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.340
Don't blame yourself.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:53.820
I heard from Qu Zhen.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.380
Zheng is quitting

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.060
because of family reasons.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.060
It has nothing to do with you

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:00.900
changing her piece.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.140
Don't feel guilty.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:03.740
I'm not blaming myself.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.340
It's just that sometimes

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.740
things don't develop the way you expect.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.300
But I can't help her.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.940
Sometimes I can't even help myself.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:18.900
That's

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.220
serious mental exhaustion.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.660
Success depends on one's own efforts.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.220
Don't force yourself.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.020
You need to learn to self-regulate.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.660
Relax a bit.

Go with the flow,
and things will fall into place.

Today?

You don't have classes
this afternoon, right?

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:06.580
No.

Is the food so great here?

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.180
Look at this long line.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.620
You'll know once you try it.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.580
I come here to eat
whenever I feel unwell after drinking.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:31.860
You just have to wait in line.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.020
See what you'd like to eat.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.340
It says side dishes are unlimited.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:40.740
Yes.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.300
You can keep adding noodles.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.340
I'll have a spiced corned egg

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.460
and tofu skin.

Yes.

Eating this
will make your stomach feel better.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.020
How is it?

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.660
It's really delicious.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.260
Not bad, right?

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.740
I think I can have two bowls.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.060
It's better with some chili.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.340
But you've been drinking.
Have the spicy stuff next time.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.260
You know how to take care of yourself.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.580
You even know
not to eat spicy food after drinking.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.340
Of course.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.340
It would upset your stomach.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.740
[Echoes of the Mind:
Modern Art Exhibition]

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.940
It's nice here.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.740
Not bad.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.220
Right?

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:58.780
There are stairs ahead.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.020
Be careful.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:28:59.380
I'm fine.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:28:59.780
Can you do it?

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:00.700
I think so.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:01.260
Let me try.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:01.580
Okay.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:03.460
Yeah, I can.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.580
Bao should be up ahead.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.580
Let's go check.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.020
There are more stairs.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:08.700
Are you really okay?

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.220
Yes.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.220
Let me help you.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.740
Bao is right there.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:15.780
Bao.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.300
This is Tan Siting,

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.620
the one I often mention to you.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:22.940
The artist.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.340
I've heard so much about you.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.580
Let me introduce myself.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.580
I'm Bao Hanlin.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.780
Just call me Bao.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.780
Now that I've met you,
I finally understand

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.020
why Yuan has remained single

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.820
all these years.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.020
Just shut up.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.780
I often hear Yuan talk about you.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:37.940
Pleasure to meet you.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.340
Let me introduce you.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.220
This is our star of the day,

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.780
the modernist painter Shi Jie.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:44.340
Just call me Shitou.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.060
This is my business partner,
Wang Zeyuan.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:48.540
Hello.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.100
Pleasure to meet you.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:50.860
And this

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.260
is our national pride,

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.780
the Venus of the Parisian scene,

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.860
Ms. Tan Siting.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.860
Is it because of my foot that you

00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.380
describe me that way?

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.260
Venus has been armless for millennia.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.340
I know of Tan Siting.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.140
I've seen your performance
at the theater.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:05.860
It was brilliant.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:06.820
I was impressed.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.020
I just never expected

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:08.780
the ballet goddess

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.420
to be standing before us like this.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:11.260
And...

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.060
And I really like your paintings.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.740
Especially "No One Shouts".

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.180
You actually like "No One Shouts"?

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.140
Thank you.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.100
Arts are interconnected.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.660
You're both artists, after all.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:25.940
Shitou.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.020
Come here for a moment.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:28.500
Excuse me,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.580
I need to attend to some guests.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:29.780
No problem.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.460
Make yourselves at home.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.380
We'll catch up later.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.620
This is really well put together.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.420
Let me introduce you.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:37.740
This is my wife, Jiao.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:38.620
Hello.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.540
Ms. Tan, hello.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.460
I often

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.700
hear Bao talk about you.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.420
I finally got to see you in person.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:44.460
Hello.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:45.660
How's work lately?

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:45.980
Busy?

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.260
It's okay. Not too busy.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:48.340
You?

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.220
I'm alright too.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.380
He's the busy one.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:53.780
Once I get through this busy period...

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:54.460
Mr. Shi

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.580
always drinks your wine

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.460
when he's creating.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.540
He's spoiled you, hasn't he?

00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.300
Mr. Shi,

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.060
I've heard so much about you.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:00.780
Hello.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.340
I

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.420
am Feng Rui from Cygne Winery.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:03.780
This is my...

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:04.900
I'm Wen Peiyan.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.060
I've heard so much about you.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:06.860
Rui.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.460
Ms. Tan is here too.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.740
Should we go say hello?

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.420
I never expected
to run into you here today,

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.300
Ms. Tan.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.060
What a coincidence.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.420
How's your foot?

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.220
Much better.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.380
We didn't get the chance before.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.220
Please introduce him to us today.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.860
Right. I didn't introduce you last time.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:28.860
This is Wang Zeyuan,

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:29.820
a good friend of mine.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.860
He works in IT.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.460
This is Ms. Wen Peiyan.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.260
She's the piano teacher
at the training center.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.380
No need for me to introduce Feng Rui.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.380
He's Ms. Wen's fiancé.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.140
The big day is coming soon.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.100
Congratulations.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:44.580
Thank you.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.540
I heard from Ms. Wei

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.740
that it was thanks to

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.940
your protection that day.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.780
Otherwise, things could go really bad.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.020
I really should thank him.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:53.540
Lately,

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.380
he's been driving me around

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.300
and cooking for me.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.780
I'm just worried
that after my foot heals,

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.260
I might have gained over ten pounds.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.100
You can lose the weight
after you gain it.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.180
Looks like you all know each other.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.300
The Six Degrees of Separation is real.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.100
It just shows how small

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:11.820
the world is.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.660
Since everyone's here,

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:14.660
let me make a recommendation.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.380
If you're interested
in Mr. Shi's paintings,

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.260
you can contact me.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:19.380
If

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.060
you're interested in collecting wine,

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.100
look for Mr. Feng Rui.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:22.660
Maybe

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.460
I'll visit your winery
to taste some wine some time, Mr. Feng.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:26.620
Thank you.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.140
No One Shouts.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.460
It looks quite oppressive.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.660
People and things in the world

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.620
can be replicated
within certain dimensions.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.860
If you accept such a world,

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.420
you acknowledge your inner desires

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.340
and your own insignificance.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.820
Then you won't let yourself
sink deep into the mire.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.460
So "No One Shouts"

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.860
isn't about oppression.
It should be about release.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.580
The same painting

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.620
can mean different things
to different people.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.420
But your interpretation
is quite unique, Ms. Tan.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.420
I just had a sudden insight.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.460
Ms. Tan, which one are you?

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.100
Oppressed or released?

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:38.900
Neither.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.780
I'm an observer.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:42.660
Observing from the outside.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:50.700
Mr. Feng,

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:52.940
lately, no matter

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:54.660
where Siting and I go,

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:55.820
we seem to run into you.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:57.300
What a coincidence.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.380
By the way,

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.340
I remember your family used to

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.740
import wine when we were young.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.620
Never expected you

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.660
to start making your own wine now.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.180
This is the wine
produced by Cygne Winery.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:14.580
How is it?

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.740
You made this?

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.380
Smooth

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.380
and crisp.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.020
Quite tasty.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.060
It seems

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.420
you always make the right choices.

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.740
Both in career

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.180
and in life.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.420
Wishing you happiness in your marriage.

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:42.820
These recent encounters

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.540
were all

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:44.940
coincidences.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.420
Don't worry.

00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:47.940
Go for it.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.780
Mr. Wang is really talented.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.420
I can tell

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.700
he cares about you a lot.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:02.860
I always felt

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.700
someone as outstanding as you

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.140
would have a true love

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:07.980
waiting for you.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.460
Thank you, Ms. Wen.

What do you think

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.900
of Mr. Wang?

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:11.900
Mr. Wang?

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.340
Ms. Tan's friend.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:18.740
Wang Zeyuan?

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:19.340
Yes.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.060
What about him?

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.340
I just think

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.900
he and Ms. Tan look good together.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.460
And he's young and accomplished.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.980
I heard he's pursued Ms. Tan
for a long time.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.420
Now they're finally together.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:33.260
Is that so?

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.580
It seems that way,

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:38.860
probably.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.260
No idea.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.780
Are you feeling more relaxed now?

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.340
Finished the noodles, now sipping tea.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.300
You really know how to plan things.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.180
You understand how to live.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.580
This place is nice, right?

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:04.540
You know what?

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:05.540
I lived in a pretty remote area

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.780
when I was little.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:08.980
I always thought

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.460
that when I grew up,

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.460
I would

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.060
live in a lively, bustling place.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.900
I'm a bit different from you.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.420
My work pace

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.900
is already very fast.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.180
So when I rest, I prefer

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.380
to slow down. Like driving around.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.780
Driving for a ride-sharing service?

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.060
Yeah.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.740
I drive for the ride-sharing service

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.660
to chat with passengers.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.060
Talk about all sorts of things.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.580
Those passengers

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.820
who get your luxury car

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.300
are pretty lucky.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.140
Actually, among those,

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.340
some

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.380
are genuinely well-off,

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.220
while others

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.140
might be doing it for face.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.660
Their demeanor
before and after getting in the car

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:51.660
can be very different.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:52.660
It's really interesting.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.780
I enjoy observing them.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.060
But I'm not doing it for face.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.700
I purely do it for comfort.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.380
You were so genuine that day.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:01.580
Very genuine?

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.420
So do you live alone now,

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.740
or with your parents?

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.300
I've always lived alone.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.300
My parents passed away early.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.860
Later, I had some luck.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.860
Started some businesses

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.860
and made some money.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.980
I also made some friends in real estate.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.460
Now we have an investment company.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:20.820
If I said I'm a fairy,

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:21.420
would you believe me?

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.180
I'd believe it.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.860
Were you single when you descended?

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.420
How do you know I'm single?

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.300
The whole world
heard you shouting about it that day.

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:36.660
Then

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:38.380
what about you?

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.460
I haven't been
in a relationship for years.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.300
Never met the right person.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.180
Love is something

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.060
you can't force.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:51.700
Just go with the flow.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.180
But I still envy those

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.100
who have love.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:38:59.980
I just feel like

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.780
love isn't in the cards for me.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.420
My past relationships...

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.060
You got hurt?

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:14.940
Actually, I don't think

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.620
love itself hurts people.

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.420
What hurts us is probably

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.420
the person within that love.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:23.620
But when we meet

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:24.820
the right person,

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.820
then love can be good.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:33.820
You're right, Mr. Wu.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:35.820
Don't call me Mr. Wu.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.180
Makes it sound like
we're doing business.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:37.940
Call me Zu.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:40.140
Zu.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:48.820
Cheers.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.260
Here.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.340
Take it slow.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.580
You should head back now.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:30.860
I'm going.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:37.740
Bye.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:38.580
Bye.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.020
Let's go, sir.

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:53.060
Grape Season?

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.140
Yes. It is now.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.780
Then I'd like one. That...

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.260
I'll have the peach one.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.700
You want the peach one, right?

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.260
Get me one.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.060
Watch your head.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.020
Watch your step.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.420
Direction. Faster.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:15.980
Okay. How many orders?

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:18.980
Zheng Yufan!

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.380
What are you doing here?

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.740
We haven't seen you in the dance studio.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.620
I've had some family matters lately.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.740
I... I'll deliver the food.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.460
Okay. Bye.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:31.300
Does it hurt?

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:31.700
No.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:33.900
Lift it up a bit.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:34.860
Okay.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:35.820
Tighten it a bit more.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:36.940
Okay.

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:37.740
How is it, doctor?

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:38.780
Not bad.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:04.460
Wang Shuhan.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:10.580
Almost there.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.180
So close.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.500
Perfect!

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.460
The invitation

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.580
is really beautiful.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.340
Solo concert.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.780
Wedding invitation.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.260
Look how happy Ms. Wen is now.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.980
Successful in both career and love.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:37.900
Ms. Wen,

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.660
don't forget to invite us
to your wedding.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:40.660
Of course I will.

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.180
How could I forget you all?

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.060
Ms. Wen,

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:46.580
at a time like this, your priority
should be your life's big event.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.740
Don't let the concert distract you.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:49.460
Right?

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.780
I can handle it for now.
