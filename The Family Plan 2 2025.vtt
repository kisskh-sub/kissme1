Breaking news.
International crime boss Liam McCaffrey

00:49.800 --> 00:52.594
died last night in prison
at the age of 76.

00:52.678 --> 00:57.224
McCaffrey, who has no known descendants,
ran a global empire of assassination,

00:57.307 --> 00:59.977
extortion and robbery spanning decades.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.729
Coming from a military background,
McCaffrey recruited…

01:11.697 --> 01:12.698
Ma'am.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.921
The package is in room 556.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.673
I need you to secure it now.

01:33.177 --> 01:35.179
You'll find a key card
taped under the bar.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.350
Got it.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.061
Avoid the lobby. Too many cameras.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.361
Where are you?

01:52.446 --> 01:53.530
We have less than an hour.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.074
- Are you gonna be late?
- I'll be there.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.639
I have eyes on the package.

02:18.722 --> 02:19.806
Open it.

02:20.724 --> 02:23.060
Are you sure?
I wasn't expecting to do this alone.

02:27.689 --> 02:28.690
Oh, my God.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.531
What do you think?

02:35.614 --> 02:38.617
What… Did you just scale a building?

02:38.700 --> 02:40.536
What, did you really think
I'd be late for date night?

02:40.619 --> 02:43.705
That is very impressive.
Someone is upping his game.

02:45.207 --> 02:48.043
If you think absurdly romantic overtures
are gonna make me forget

02:48.126 --> 02:49.711
that you've been away all week…

02:51.046 --> 02:52.047
you might be right.

02:53.966 --> 02:54.967
Do you like it?

02:55.050 --> 02:56.343
It's beauti… What?

03:02.224 --> 03:03.475
Yeah.

03:03.559 --> 03:06.728
You are very good with your hands,
Mr. Morgan.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.772
You bet I am, Mrs. Morgan.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.031
Ignore it.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.667
It's date night, buddy. What's up?

03:28.750 --> 03:30.127
Max barfed, that's what.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.254
- Oh, my…
- Well, you're the sitter. It happens.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.755
You gotta clean it up. What was in it?

03:33.839 --> 03:36.383
- Gatorade, Cheerios, carrots…
- Oh, my…

03:36.466 --> 03:38.010
- …I think.
- Did it get on the new couch?

03:40.012 --> 03:41.597
A little bit.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.723
It's pink.

03:43.515 --> 03:44.641
All right, here's what you do.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.853
Give him one tablespoon of apple
cider vinegar in a cup of warm water.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.479
Tell him to sip it, not chug.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.064
And we'll be home in an hour.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.483
Thirty minutes? Twenty?

03:54.985 --> 03:56.528
We'll be right there.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.530
- We gotta take care of the Max thing.
- We have to. He's never sick.

03:58.614 --> 04:00.490
Come on, let's go. Come on.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.201
- We'll come back. Another time.
- We will, yes.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.286
- This is the room we made Max in.
- Yes. Yes, it was the room.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.246
- It is. Yes. Hello!
- That was so much fun!

04:15.339 --> 04:17.257
You burden me with your questions

04:17.341 --> 04:19.134
You'd have me tell no lies

04:20.928 --> 04:22.679
- Kyle, you know you love it.
- Come on!

04:22.763 --> 04:24.014
- No.
- You gotta sing with us!

04:24.097 --> 04:26.517
- Come on, Kyle!
- You say to me I don't talk enough

04:26.600 --> 04:28.560
But when I do I'm a fool

04:28.644 --> 04:30.395
These times I've spent, I've realized…

04:30.479 --> 04:32.147
- Kyle!
- Come on, Kyle!

04:32.231 --> 04:33.774
- Come on, Kyle. You know the words.
- I'm not doing it.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.734
- The things you say
- No.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.028
Stop. Come on.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.447
- I'm not doing it.
- The things you say

04:41.657 --> 04:43.659
You're unbelievable!

04:57.464 --> 05:00.133
- Hi, everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
- Mom!

05:00.217 --> 05:01.426
I made the sweet potatoes.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.638
Hi, Dad!

05:08.350 --> 05:09.601
Did you see that?

05:09.685 --> 05:12.604
- That was extraordinary.
- Come on. Go, go, go, go, go!

05:12.688 --> 05:14.857
Hey, Kyle. Can I make you a Negroni?

05:14.940 --> 05:16.233
- What's a Negroni?
- No.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.861
How about you just get some more ice
from the big freezer, bud?

05:18.944 --> 05:21.238
- Ice is more like it.
- What do you think, Mup-Mup?

05:21.738 --> 05:23.532
Give it a shot.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.661
- Ice?
- Yes. Yes, thanks. Right there.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.084
More gin.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.176
Why am I at the kids' table?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.678
Better luck next year, honey.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.227
- Grab me a beer!
- Let your sister sit here.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.021
He wants his favorite child
sitting next to him.

05:54.104 --> 05:57.858
I can't help being the only girl
in a family of lunkhead boys.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.735
Hey, hey, hey, look who I have!

05:59.818 --> 06:02.654
Live from her studying abroad in London,
Ms. Nina Morgan.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.198
Nina!

06:04.281 --> 06:06.867
Hi, guys! I miss you so much.
I'm sorry I'm not there.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.035
Speaking of favorite children.

06:08.118 --> 06:12.789
Thanksgiving is not really a thing here,
but I got a turkey sandwich. So…

06:12.873 --> 06:15.083
At least you got some turkey.
Grandpa's been eating all the turkey here.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.378
Hey, Nina. How's the journalism going?

06:18.462 --> 06:20.839
I heard that awful man
you wrote the article about,

06:20.923 --> 06:23.091
the one who was behind all that mess
in Las Vegas?

06:23.175 --> 06:24.593
He died in prison last week.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.261
Yeah, I heard, Grandpa.

06:29.348 --> 06:32.100
Do you guys remember
the year that no one got turkey

06:32.184 --> 06:35.395
because you two idiots tried to
deep-fry it and set the garage on fire?

06:35.479 --> 06:36.730
Yeah.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.066
I am sorry for what my dad said.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.150
It's fine.

06:41.944 --> 06:44.947
- The man tried to kill us, Jess.
- He was still your father.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.908
It's okay to feel whatever you feel. Okay?

06:47.991 --> 06:49.117
Thank you.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.244
Max, Max.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.453
Can you please give me to Mom?

06:51.537 --> 06:52.829
- Easy, Usain Bolt.
- Can you give me to Mom?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.581
- Please?
- I think it's my turn with Nina, huh?

06:54.665 --> 06:56.458
- Thank you so much.
- There.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.043
- You wanna go see Mup-Mup?
- Not really.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.128
Come on. Don't you like it
when she takes her teeth out

07:00.212 --> 07:01.255
and gives you kissies?

07:01.797 --> 07:03.590
Hi. How are you? How's the team?

07:03.674 --> 07:06.552
Great. Yeah,
we are looking to repeat at State.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.429
- Wow.
- In fact, an offer came in.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.516
- Spill.
- Head of Women's Track at Ohio State.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.600
Really?

07:13.684 --> 07:15.602
- Yes! Yes!
- Are you serious?

07:15.686 --> 07:17.479
That's awesome. That's a D1 school.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.356
- Yeah, I know.
- You're obviously…

07:19.439 --> 07:21.275
- You're gonna take it, right?
- I haven't decided yet.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.985
You know, I haven't even talked
to your dad about it.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.403
- Mom.
- It's…

07:24.486 --> 07:28.699
It means moving to Ohio, Nina.
That's not a part of the plan.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.118
You know how your dad feels about Buffalo.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.203
Besides, it's a really big job.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.831
You know, dealing with athletic directors
and elite athletes

07:35.914 --> 07:38.417
and fundraisers and alumni, and…
God, who am I take that on?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.043
No, Mom. Don't do that please, okay?

07:40.127 --> 07:41.920
You're allowed to thrive
in your profession.

07:42.004 --> 07:46.216
I know. I just feel like sometimes
it's at a cost to us.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.551
You know, our family.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.970
Okay, enough about me.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.723
Did you decide what day
you're gonna come back for Christmas?

07:54.349 --> 07:55.392
Yeah.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.019
About that.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.983
No, no, no, no, no. Jess, the Morgans
are always together on Christmas.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.276
That's nonnegotiable.

08:04.359 --> 08:07.112
She'd have to make
a round-trip international flight, Dan.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.698
For what? A couple of days
before she starts classes again?

08:09.781 --> 08:12.618
And you know she's already freaking out
about her carbon footprint.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.203
- Please.
- Kyle,

08:14.286 --> 08:16.163
can you imagine Christmas without Nina?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.665
- Yeah.
- Thanks. You're a big help.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.168
Dan. She's 20.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.837
I've got my girls thing.
I'll see you later. All right?

08:23.921 --> 08:25.506
- Love you, guys.
- She's gotta come home.

08:25.589 --> 08:26.590
We'll see.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.051
All right, well, I got a thing, so…

08:29.134 --> 08:31.803
Where are you going?
No. You're not going anywhere.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.179
You're still grounded.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.182
You can't be serious.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.433
You erased the entire grades record
for all of Taft High.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.727
Yeah, and? It's a senior prank.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.063
You almost went to jail.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.023
Gaming is one thing. Hacking is illegal.

08:43.106 --> 08:47.361
Well, I'm 18 now,
and you're not my legal guardian,

08:47.444 --> 08:48.820
so you can't ground me anymore.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.406
Right. Right, but I'm the owner
of the house you live in.

08:51.490 --> 08:54.076
I pay for your food, your Internet,
all your other shit.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.661
You're not going anywhere.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.371
You gotta work on
your college application.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.249
- I'll go work on my application.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.043
What's going on around here, dude?

09:03.126 --> 09:04.378
It's Christmas.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.463
- You want Nina to come home?
- Yeah.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.383
- Morning.
- Morning, boss.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.595
Hey, Issa, you think
I travel too much for work?

09:13.679 --> 09:15.806
Did Jessica say something?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.850
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.351
But you're building your business, right?

09:19.434 --> 09:21.478
That's what I said. And it's true.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.605
But we're never together
as a family anymore.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.774
I mean, we're like ships passing
in the night.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.361
- Any international offers come in lately?
- Yeah.

09:29.444 --> 09:33.782
We got a tech start-up in Oslo.
They want their security tested.

09:33.866 --> 09:37.452
No. Okay, FedEx distribution center
in Mexico City…

09:37.536 --> 09:38.537
What about the UK?

09:38.620 --> 09:41.540
A bank did reach out
from London last week.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.423
All right. This is more like it.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.967
All right, have the team
start the initial prep.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.051
Okay. Got it.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.472
Operation Morgan Family Christmas is a go.

09:57.556 --> 09:58.724
Christmas in London?

09:58.807 --> 10:00.142
Yeah, think about it.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.102
I knock out one quick job
and the whole trip's a business expense.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.312
It pays for itself.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.688
Hey! There's no 5:00 and 7:00.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.691
It's 10:00 and 2:00 at all times
or you lose your driving privileges.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.361
Okay. Well, stop treating me like a kid.
I passed my test.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.030
I don't wanna go to London. I'm busy.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.781
At Christmas? With what?

10:14.865 --> 10:15.866
There's a tournament.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.618
And besides,
I don't need to fly 3,000 miles

10:17.701 --> 10:19.244
to play second fiddle
to your golden child.

10:19.328 --> 10:20.412
What are you talking about?

10:20.495 --> 10:21.914
We don't play favorites.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.878
- You arrived first, go ahead.
- I know, but he's flashing.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.963
That's the international sign
for "go ahead."

10:30.047 --> 10:32.299
Okay, what's the international sign
for stop backseat driving?

10:33.800 --> 10:37.596
Dan, London is really far,
and Max has never flown before.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.097
Well, he's gotta start sometime.

10:39.181 --> 10:40.265
Wait, I'm confused.

10:40.349 --> 10:41.934
Now you don't wanna spend Christmas
in London?

10:42.017 --> 10:43.143
I thought you'd be thrilled.

10:43.227 --> 10:45.771
No, I just think that
we should enjoy Christmas at our house.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.147
Who knows how many more we're gonna have?

10:47.231 --> 10:48.732
Yeah, that's my point exactly.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.859
Nina and Kyle are gonna have
their own families before we know it.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.903
I'm playing the field
for at least a decade.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.821
- So gross.
- Please.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.157
You know what? Get in the right lane, Hef.

10:57.241 --> 11:00.452
Look, I just want us to be together
as a family. That's all I want.

11:00.536 --> 11:01.620
It's a great idea, Mommy.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.998
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.544
I mean, as long as we're together,
that's where home is, right?

11:08.627 --> 11:11.046
Home isn't defined by a house or a city.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.631
- Right?
- Yeah, this could work.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.801
We visit Nina and we see
how Christmas feels in a new setting.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.637
Hell, we're not tied to Buffalo,
are we, kid?

11:18.720 --> 11:21.723
- Well, we do love Buffalo.
- No. London. Yes, let's do it.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.809
- Yeah.
- Stop sign!

11:23.892 --> 11:25.143
Shit!

11:28.397 --> 11:29.606
You know what? Mom's right.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.733
London's a great idea.
Let's get out of here.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.835
You know, I can't tell if this
is bohemian cool or deeply concerning.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.921
What? I think it's fine.

12:34.004 --> 12:37.299
Shouldn't we meet Nina later at the hotel
like we planned?

12:37.382 --> 12:39.885
No, no. If we'd have stayed at the hotel,
we would've all fallen asleep,

12:39.968 --> 12:41.053
and then you've got jet lag.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.429
We just gotta power through today…

12:42.513 --> 12:43.597
- Yeah.
- …and then we'll be fine.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.474
Besides, she's gonna be psyched
to see us. Right, Kyle?

12:45.557 --> 12:47.142
Yeah, I don't care. I gotta pee, so…

12:47.226 --> 12:48.769
- This is it, 18.
- What? What, this?

12:48.852 --> 12:50.896
- Watch out.
- What?

12:50.979 --> 12:52.439
What? That… Do you think… Is she in there?

12:52.523 --> 12:54.441
- I don't know.
- I don't think she should be in here.

12:54.525 --> 12:55.651
Kyle, wait.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.486
I think our daughter's a squatter.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.156
Bathroom emergency.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.824
Merry Christmas, Beans.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.701
- You're early.
- Hi, honey.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.119
You gotta act like you're happy
to see your mom.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.834
Look at all of this natural light.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.752
What happened to meeting at the hotel?

13:14.503 --> 13:18.215
Hey. Hey, Little Miss Greenpeace,
you left the shower running.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.342
Yeah, it's… Can you just…
Just leave it, please. Just…

13:23.554 --> 13:27.516
Okay, a person. Stranger danger.
That's a man.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.185
What the…

13:31.478 --> 13:34.314
No. No, no. Just please let him go.
It's fine…

13:36.400 --> 13:38.151
He's my… This is my boyfriend.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.155
Mom, Dad. Omar.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.575
He's got wet muscles.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.286
Omar, the Morgans.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.705
- Hey, Daddy.
- Easy there, pal.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.456
Hey. He is your boyfriend? This guy is--

13:51.540 --> 13:52.541
Ripped.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.127
Mom, gross.

13:55.711 --> 13:57.546
Sorry, I'm Jessica Morgan.
Very nice to meet you.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.423
Enchanté.
I see where Nina gets her beauty.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.925
Oh, my God. I love your accent.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.011
- Yeah. Easy there, Mrs. Robinson.
- Thank you.

14:05.304 --> 14:06.263
So you're French?

14:06.638 --> 14:07.931
Yes, French-Moroccan

14:08.015 --> 14:09.016
How old are you?

14:09.099 --> 14:09.933
Twenty-four

14:10.726 --> 14:12.477
Isn't that a little too old
to be dating my daughter?

14:13.145 --> 14:14.771
Actually, no I don't think it is

14:14.855 --> 14:17.274
What? Did you learn French in England?

14:17.774 --> 14:19.276
I wonder why.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.777
Are you done now with your inquisition?

14:20.861 --> 14:22.112
No.

14:22.196 --> 14:23.947
What does he do for a living?

14:24.031 --> 14:26.241
- I cook.
- He's a chef.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.368
That is very impressive.

14:28.452 --> 14:29.745
And I do parkour.

14:29.828 --> 14:30.913
- That explains it.
- Yep.

14:30.996 --> 14:32.581
- And I DJ.
- Triple threat.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.875
Yeah, Omar is very multitalented.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.377
Can he put some clothes on?

14:38.545 --> 14:39.546
Yes, Daddy.

14:40.464 --> 14:41.798
Did he just call me Daddy?

14:44.343 --> 14:45.802
So, Omar?

14:46.303 --> 14:47.346
He's a good guy.

14:47.846 --> 14:51.266
He really makes me laugh.
And he cares about the world a lot.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.393
Hey, we care about the world.

14:53.477 --> 14:54.811
Yeah, I know.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.856
You know what I mean though.
Like, he goes to marches with me.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.108
And wants to make a difference.
He's, like…

15:00.192 --> 15:01.777
He's, like, really, really hot.

15:02.361 --> 15:03.403
I mean, sorry…

15:03.487 --> 15:05.739
He's just a major upgrade from Trevor.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.282
It's true.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.451
We're really happy for you.

15:10.369 --> 15:11.453
Aren't we, Dan?

15:11.537 --> 15:12.788
- Love him.
- Yeah.

15:12.871 --> 15:13.872
He's wonderful.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.457
Don't bring him back to Buffalo.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.627
It's gonna be too cold for him.
Probably doesn't like the snow, right?

15:18.710 --> 15:20.546
- Should we grab a coffee?
- Did you not tell him about OSU?

15:20.629 --> 15:22.214
- What?
- 'Cause I'm so tired. I'm so tired, Dan.

15:22.297 --> 15:26.051
So, you're the beep-beep
boop-boop big man?

15:27.594 --> 15:30.264
I've never heard it
put that way, I guess, but yeah.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.891
Do you game?

15:32.975 --> 15:34.059
- No.
- No?

15:34.142 --> 15:35.435
Life is my game.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.354
Yeah, I played that one.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.523
It gets a little dull after a while.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.900
Like this. Like, what are we doing?

15:41.984 --> 15:43.527
I could be at a tournament right now,

15:43.610 --> 15:46.113
but I feel like I'm walking
in a circle to nowhere.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.364
Everywhere is somewhere.

15:47.865 --> 15:50.117
- That's deep, Omar.
- No, I mean it.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.244
For instance, there.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.162
What do you see?

15:55.038 --> 15:56.164
Wall thing?

15:57.457 --> 15:58.458
You know what I see?

15:58.542 --> 16:00.544
Something other than a wall thing?

16:12.639 --> 16:14.349
Wow!

16:14.433 --> 16:15.434
That's what I see.

16:18.437 --> 16:19.688
I wanna try.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.441
Parkour!

16:25.777 --> 16:28.697
- You okay? Yeah?
- Totally fine.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.199
- Max!
- Hey, hey, hey!

16:30.282 --> 16:32.576
- That was great.
- Maxie, you all right?

16:32.659 --> 16:34.411
Hey. What the hell was that?

16:34.494 --> 16:35.996
- He's fine, Daddy. Look.
- You okay?

16:36.079 --> 16:37.623
- He's four. Stop calling me Daddy.
- Are you sure?

16:37.706 --> 16:40.334
I'm just saying, look, my father
was overprotective when I was young

16:40.417 --> 16:42.419
and now we don't speak.
Kids need to run free.

16:42.503 --> 16:43.962
- Yeah, Dad.
- I knew this guy was bad news.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.381
I mean, what kind of kid
doesn't speak to their dad?

16:49.384 --> 16:50.886
- That's different.
- I actually have to run.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.930
'Cause I have one last exam
before break, so…

16:53.013 --> 16:54.806
- Me too. I got a scrim lined up…
- No.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.350
- …with Valkyrae.
- No, no, no, no.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.520
What happened to Morgan Family Christmas?
This trip is about quality time together.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.104
I have a whole itinerary
planned out for us.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.523
Of course you do.

17:02.606 --> 17:03.690
What's that supposed to mean?

17:03.774 --> 17:05.692
All right. Listen, you've got your meeting
in the morning.

17:05.776 --> 17:08.862
Why don't we just all do what
we need to do, which is kick our jet lag

17:08.945 --> 17:11.823
and officially start Morgan Family
Christmas for real tomorrow?

17:11.906 --> 17:12.950
- Is that a deal or what?
- Yeah, deal.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.492
- Deal.
- Deal?

17:14.576 --> 17:15.993
- Okay.
- Deal.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.329
What?

17:17.412 --> 17:19.830
Call your dad, all right?
He's overprotective because he loves you.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.083
It's okay.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.628
- It's all right. Come on.
- Kyle, did you see me do parkour?

17:43.647 --> 17:45.065
Cheerio, mate.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.236
How'd you sleep?

17:49.319 --> 17:51.655
- Like a log.
- That's good.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.366
Yeah. You ready for your meeting?

17:54.449 --> 17:55.784
Yeah, should be routine.

17:55.868 --> 17:57.661
Wake up, Kyle. It's nearly Christmas.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.204
We're gonna assess their security,

17:59.288 --> 18:00.497
find their weak points,

18:00.581 --> 18:03.750
and we are getting a fully paid Christmas
holiday for one hour's work.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.627
So exciting.

18:05.711 --> 18:08.130
What the hell time is it?
And how is it light?

18:09.298 --> 18:10.716
Didn't I tell you
you're gonna be jet lagged?

18:10.799 --> 18:12.551
I told you stay off the game…

18:12.634 --> 18:14.178
- That's right.
- …and sleep on the plane.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.098
- Hello.
- Morning, Beans.

18:18.182 --> 18:20.559
- Good morning.
- Nina with coffee.

18:20.642 --> 18:21.852
You look cute, Mom.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.395
- Thank you.
- Very Christmassy.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.606
All right, I'm off.
I'll meet you guys for lunch.

18:25.689 --> 18:26.899
- Morgan Family Christmas…
- Okay.

18:26.982 --> 18:29.151
…officially kicks off
in three hours and 28 minutes.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.235
Yes.

18:30.319 --> 18:34.114
And you, lucky lady, are in charge
of holding on to the tickets.

18:34.198 --> 18:37.326
We've got the bus tour, then London Eye,
then dinner and a show tonight.

18:37.409 --> 18:39.411
- Packed itinerary.
- This is so relaxing.

18:39.912 --> 18:41.872
- I love it.
- It's gonna be great.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.458
And remember, it's just us.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.418
- Yes, us and Omar.
- Okay?

18:46.502 --> 18:47.503
No, just us.

18:47.586 --> 18:49.296
- It's immediate family.
- Okay. I understand.

18:49.379 --> 18:50.672
We'll see how many tickets
are there. Okay.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.341
- Go.
- Bye.

18:55.677 --> 18:58.013
"Don't bring Omar home to Buffalo."

18:58.096 --> 19:00.974
You still haven't told him
about the OSU offer.

19:01.058 --> 19:02.726
I'm just waiting for the perfect moment.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.937
All right, maybe I'm just selfish
to even consider it.

19:05.020 --> 19:06.647
- Okay, Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom. Please.
- Nina, honestly.

19:06.730 --> 19:11.151
No. Okay, you have lived
in Buffalo for 20 years, okay?

19:11.235 --> 19:12.653
I would say he owes you one.

19:13.362 --> 19:14.988
Just don't wait too long to tell him.

19:15.072 --> 19:18.033
Anyway, I'm gonna bring the boys
to St. James's Park with Omar.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.535
So, you can relax for a little bit.

19:19.618 --> 19:20.953
Just, like, do your thing,
order room service,

19:21.036 --> 19:22.037
whatever you wanna do.

19:22.120 --> 19:26.542
Because you have like three hours
and exactly 27 minutes

19:26.625 --> 19:29.086
to figure out how you're gonna tell Dad
that we're moving to Ohio.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.380
Do it. Okay?

19:31.463 --> 19:32.840
Good luck!

19:32.923 --> 19:34.341
Max!

20:10.043 --> 20:11.545
- Hi, how are you today?
- Hi.

20:11.628 --> 20:12.921
- Dan.
- I'm looking for a…

20:14.089 --> 20:16.425
I'll take it from here, Annette. Thanks.

20:16.508 --> 20:17.968
Aiden Clarke.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.887
We spoke on the phone.
How was your flight?

20:20.637 --> 20:22.097
- Terrific.
- Liar.

20:23.348 --> 20:24.349
All right, fair enough.

20:24.433 --> 20:27.102
My kid kept me up all night asking
how Santa's gonna find us in London.

20:28.187 --> 20:30.647
Well, look, as I mentioned,
we recently expanded

20:30.731 --> 20:32.900
and we're bringing our new branches
up to standard.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.986
Your associate mentioned you offer
"kinetic assessment."

20:36.069 --> 20:37.529
Demonstrations of our weaknesses?

20:37.613 --> 20:38.947
That's our premium service.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.158
We're a premium bank.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.911
You want me to break into your bank?

20:45.204 --> 20:46.205
Right now?

20:47.414 --> 20:48.624
It's what you do, isn't it?

20:49.333 --> 20:51.668
All right. Walk with me. Nice and casual.

20:55.547 --> 20:58.550
Now, that is a key card entry door.

20:58.634 --> 21:00.677
And I hope you're not expecting
to use mine.

21:00.761 --> 21:02.387
No, I'll use my RF scanner.

21:02.471 --> 21:04.139
I cloned someone's card
when they entered earlier.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.101
Well…

21:08.185 --> 21:09.978
This is already depressing.

21:10.062 --> 21:12.397
I'm just getting warmed up. After you.

21:15.651 --> 21:18.070
Dan, there's something that I need to…

21:20.989 --> 21:22.324
Dan, you know how we always say,

21:22.407 --> 21:24.493
"Happy parents make for happy kids"?

21:29.206 --> 21:32.668
You know what's crazy beautiful?
Ohio in the spring.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.672
Room service.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.509
I actually already ate.

21:44.346 --> 21:47.349
Most of these cameras are wireless.
That's a mistake.

21:47.850 --> 21:48.851
They should be hardwired

21:48.934 --> 21:51.103
or the right hacker
could see every inch of this place.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.313
All right, where do you wanna break into?

21:54.106 --> 21:55.858
Safe deposit room? It's just down…

21:55.941 --> 21:57.276
This way. I know.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.864
Wow. Look at that. Centcom 584M.

22:01.947 --> 22:03.699
Good model. Except for one weakness.

22:03.782 --> 22:05.534
Let me guess. RF scanner?

22:05.617 --> 22:07.286
Nah, good old-fashioned paper clip.

22:20.132 --> 22:23.051
Excuse me, you can't be back here.

22:24.136 --> 22:26.638
Doug. Just the man I'm looking for.

22:26.722 --> 22:28.849
You have something in your teeth,

22:29.391 --> 22:31.226
and there's a very unhappy client
asking for you out front.

22:34.771 --> 22:38.525
Confidence and a little humiliation
goes a long way, huh?

22:40.194 --> 22:43.780
All right, this is more like it.
Reinforced steel.

22:43.864 --> 22:45.782
Let me guess. Paper clip proof?

22:46.366 --> 22:48.702
And then some.
There's no RF scanning this one.

22:49.286 --> 22:50.537
You need an actual card.

22:51.622 --> 22:52.873
Let's use Doug's.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.583
I didn't see you take that.

22:55.250 --> 22:57.836
Neither did he. I had a unique education.

23:01.173 --> 23:02.674
- Shall we?
- After you.

23:02.758 --> 23:04.259
No, I insist. Please.

23:11.308 --> 23:13.810
Who the hell are you
and what's happening here?

23:15.812 --> 23:18.482
Doug didn't recognize you,
and neither did Annette.

23:19.274 --> 23:20.901
You got some rough hands.

23:20.984 --> 23:22.361
You're no bank manager.

23:22.986 --> 23:25.739
So I'm gonna ask you again. Who are you?

23:26.990 --> 23:28.033
Pocket.

23:31.203 --> 23:32.287
Slowly.

23:39.837 --> 23:41.463
You son of a bitch.

23:43.799 --> 23:45.300
What do you want?

23:45.801 --> 23:47.970
I want you to finish the job, Sean.

23:50.222 --> 23:52.808
Deposit box 411. Make it quick.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.477
It shouldn't be a problem
for a pro like you.

24:01.275 --> 24:04.152
Chop-chop, Sean. I'd hate to hurt
that lovely wife of yours.

24:18.292 --> 24:19.293
Here.

24:19.376 --> 24:21.712
You have what you want. Let her go.

24:21.795 --> 24:22.880
Open it.

24:28.302 --> 24:30.804
Unless you want little Maxie
to be an orphan.

24:49.198 --> 24:52.951
So, you recognize it then?

24:54.286 --> 24:55.329
It's a digital key.

24:55.412 --> 24:57.372
It's more than that and you know it.

24:58.332 --> 25:00.209
It's the key to the kingdom.

25:01.585 --> 25:03.086
How do you know about it?

25:03.170 --> 25:04.171
Well…

25:05.464 --> 25:06.673
Maybe this'll help.

25:09.843 --> 25:11.261
What a handsome lad you were.

25:11.345 --> 25:13.180
Do you recognize where that is?

25:14.306 --> 25:16.808
Yeah. Portrane. Where my Dad was from.

25:18.685 --> 25:19.686
Him?

25:21.146 --> 25:22.898
That was the maid's kid. He was…

25:25.817 --> 25:27.069
Finn?

25:28.111 --> 25:31.615
I go by my middle name now.
And my mother's last name.

25:31.698 --> 25:36.119
You see, our father never let me use his.

25:38.413 --> 25:39.498
You're my brother?

25:40.165 --> 25:41.333
I am, Sean.

25:41.416 --> 25:42.417
Yeah.

25:43.627 --> 25:46.880
Yeah, unfortunately,
our reunion will be short-lived.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.466
My prize is this.

25:50.092 --> 25:53.512
Your prize is taking the blame
for everything we've just done.

25:54.972 --> 25:59.059
You see, this gives me proof of
every ghastly thing you ever did for Dad,

25:59.142 --> 26:01.979
so you should probably keep
your mouth shut about me to the cops

26:02.062 --> 26:03.438
if you don't want to be executed.

26:03.981 --> 26:06.316
Jail's better, trust me.

26:07.442 --> 26:09.444
And, just so you know,

26:10.487 --> 26:12.030
I could've gotten this without you,

26:12.114 --> 26:14.700
but it's so much sweeter this way.

26:15.742 --> 26:16.994
Two birds, one stone.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.996
How are you planning on
getting us out of here?

26:19.079 --> 26:20.330
Yeah.

26:20.414 --> 26:22.749
I don't have to, brother. You do.

26:22.833 --> 26:25.419
So be convincing,

26:26.545 --> 26:28.672
unless you want me to
kill your entire family.

26:30.757 --> 26:31.925
He's got a gun!

26:36.430 --> 26:38.891
- Get down. Get down!
- Everyone, stay down!

26:42.269 --> 26:43.437
He's a madman!

26:44.396 --> 26:45.439
He says he'll kill me.

26:46.231 --> 26:47.524
Shut up.

26:48.025 --> 26:49.443
Walk.

26:49.985 --> 26:51.570
You're doing great, Sean.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.405
I got you out. Where is she?

26:53.488 --> 26:54.573
Where is she?

26:57.284 --> 26:58.994
I got you out. Where is she?

27:00.662 --> 27:02.581
I always imagined what it would be like
meeting you again.

27:03.916 --> 27:05.918
The great Sean McCaffrey.

27:06.001 --> 27:08.295
Dad's pride and joy.

27:08.378 --> 27:09.880
You okay?

27:09.963 --> 27:11.965
Bit of a letdown if you ask me.

27:13.008 --> 27:14.051
Enjoy prison, brother.

27:14.134 --> 27:16.595
- Why do you have a gun?
- They taped it to my hand.

27:16.678 --> 27:17.679
What is going on?

27:17.763 --> 27:19.431
They think I robbed a bank.

27:19.515 --> 27:21.850
- Come on, we gotta get out of here.
- Drop your weapon!

27:21.934 --> 27:24.061
- We're the good guys! They're cops!
- It's a long story! Okay?

27:24.811 --> 27:26.313
We gotta go get the kids.

27:26.396 --> 27:28.398
Stop! Armed police!

27:31.068 --> 27:32.069
Oh, shit.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.321
- Make a right at the alley.
- What?

27:34.404 --> 27:36.323
- Here, here, here. Go, go, go, go.
- What? What? What?

27:37.449 --> 27:40.244
- Holy shit, you're fast.
- Well, I'm a track coach. Keep up.

27:40.327 --> 27:42.162
- Can you get rid of that gun?
- No, I can't!

27:42.246 --> 27:44.248
Well, you're gonna have to tuck it away!

27:44.873 --> 27:46.667
- Go inside. Go in here. Go in here.
- What? What?

27:46.750 --> 27:47.960
Just go in here. Come on.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.805
Oh, shit.

28:00.305 --> 28:02.683
- Oh, shit.
- She's got a gun!

28:02.766 --> 28:03.851
She's got a gun!

28:04.434 --> 28:05.727
I'm so sorry.

28:05.811 --> 28:08.105
No. This isn't what you think. No!
No, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

28:08.188 --> 28:10.482
- It's okay. Don't worry. I owe you a bag.
- I'm so sorry.

28:10.566 --> 28:12.067
Come on. This way.

28:12.150 --> 28:14.987
Oh, my God.
I can't believe we just stole her bag!

28:23.996 --> 28:25.789
- Turn around.
- Where are we going?

28:25.873 --> 28:28.500
Armed officers in pursuit.
Do we have a visual on the fugitives?

28:28.584 --> 28:31.336
Back to their hotel.
Prick won't leave without those brats.

28:31.420 --> 28:32.838
St. James's Square.

28:34.381 --> 28:35.465
Go. Now!

28:40.012 --> 28:41.847
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

28:43.473 --> 28:45.100
Good. Very good.

28:45.642 --> 28:47.853
You're lucky to be
so far away from home, man.

28:47.936 --> 28:49.521
Dad's such a pain in my ass.

28:49.605 --> 28:53.483
I felt the same way,
but, honestly, though, like,

28:53.567 --> 28:56.862
now that they're not literally up my ass
every single day, I kind of miss it.

28:57.654 --> 28:59.823
Dad just needs to accept
that he doesn't, like,

29:00.449 --> 29:02.409
always know what's best for us
all the time.

29:02.492 --> 29:04.119
- Yeah.
- I wanna go higher.

29:04.203 --> 29:07.956
Hey, Omar! Omar!
Not too high, okay? He's only four!

29:08.790 --> 29:10.918
Oh, my God. I sound like Dad.

29:13.003 --> 29:16.006
It's sweet. Max finally
found a friend that's on his level.

29:18.217 --> 29:19.510
You're so funny.

29:20.302 --> 29:22.471
- Nice ringtone, loser.
- That's Dad.

29:25.265 --> 29:26.266
Hey, Dad.

29:27.809 --> 29:28.977
Yeah, they're both here. What's up?

29:29.061 --> 29:32.105
Stay where you are.
Yeah. And get rid of your phones.

29:33.982 --> 29:36.568
- What's going on?
- Dad's ranting about phones again.

29:36.652 --> 29:38.445
I'm not ranting about phones, Kyle!

29:39.112 --> 29:40.948
- It feels kind of ranty.
- Put your sister on!

29:41.573 --> 29:43.825
I said, "Put your sister on!"

29:44.493 --> 29:45.619
Translate Dad, please.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.205
Hey.

29:50.082 --> 29:51.792
Okay.

29:52.876 --> 29:55.879
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I got it.
Sure. Yeah, I got it.

29:57.756 --> 29:59.341
- What the hell?
- There's trouble.

29:59.424 --> 30:00.801
Yeah. There… Now there is.
I just bought that.

30:00.884 --> 30:03.011
No, no, idiot. Like, Dad trouble.
Like, Vegas trouble.

30:03.095 --> 30:05.597
Omar! Playtime's over. I need Max.

30:05.681 --> 30:08.100
- But he's doing so well.
- No, Omar. Now!

30:10.853 --> 30:12.145
Give me your phone.

30:12.229 --> 30:13.397
- Give me your phone!
- Again?

30:13.480 --> 30:14.982
Come on!

30:16.984 --> 30:19.361
Nina! Kyle!

30:20.654 --> 30:21.989
Go round. Go round!

30:24.116 --> 30:25.534
Max!

30:26.410 --> 30:27.494
Oh, God.

30:27.578 --> 30:29.997
- Did you get rid of your phones?
- What the hell is going on?

30:30.080 --> 30:32.499
I'll explain later, okay?
We gotta get out of here now.

30:32.583 --> 30:34.585
Come on, run. This way. Come on!

30:35.586 --> 30:36.795
Come on, Maxie. Stay with Daddy.

30:38.422 --> 30:39.715
Stop, stop, stop.

30:40.924 --> 30:42.050
Yes.

30:43.302 --> 30:44.720
Gotcha. Go. Go!

30:47.431 --> 30:49.474
- Who's in the car?
- That's your uncle.

30:49.558 --> 30:50.893
Wait, what? Our uncle?

30:50.976 --> 30:52.519
- Not the time, guys!
- It sort of feels like the time.

30:52.603 --> 30:54.813
- Nina, give me the tickets.
- Dan, please tell me you have a plan.

30:54.897 --> 30:55.981
I got a plan.

30:57.900 --> 30:59.109
There. There!

31:06.325 --> 31:08.660
You might wanna get rid of your bag
before we get on the bus.

31:08.744 --> 31:10.370
What's with the bag?

31:10.454 --> 31:12.122
- Nothing to see here, honey.
- Wait a minute.

31:12.206 --> 31:13.290
Come on.

31:14.875 --> 31:16.710
- Oh, God.
- Come on, guys.

31:17.794 --> 31:19.796
- Come on, guys.
- Oh, God.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.507
- Ticket, please.
- Here you go, sir.

31:21.590 --> 31:23.342
All right. Come on, everybody.
Get on the bus.

31:27.012 --> 31:30.390
Welcome to London's Automated Bus Tour,

31:30.474 --> 31:32.726
giving you fascinating facts.

31:32.809 --> 31:35.479
Fasten your seat belts,
also hang on to your cameras…

31:35.562 --> 31:38.357
Okay, since when do we have another uncle
and why is he trying to kill us?

31:38.440 --> 31:39.525
Yeah. More secrets, Dan?

31:39.608 --> 31:41.151
I didn't know about him, Jess. I promise.

31:41.235 --> 31:42.486
Okay. Well, who the hell is he?

31:42.569 --> 31:43.904
Go on, Sean.

31:44.404 --> 31:45.447
Tell her.

31:46.657 --> 31:49.993
Tell her how Dad left me on a barren rock…

31:51.995 --> 31:54.498
without even the McCaffrey name
to call my own.

31:55.832 --> 32:00.003
He gave you everything you ever wanted
and you threw it away.

32:01.046 --> 32:02.089
For what?

32:02.840 --> 32:04.842
To raise pimple-covered brats.

32:07.469 --> 32:10.013
The key, Sean. Now.

32:10.097 --> 32:11.181
What key?

32:13.100 --> 32:14.852
I'll give you to the count of three.

32:15.811 --> 32:17.729
One, two…

32:24.278 --> 32:25.445
Get off me.

32:28.365 --> 32:32.119
Look to your left, you'll see
the iconic Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain,

32:32.202 --> 32:34.872
affectionately known as Eros…

32:37.249 --> 32:42.045
although it actually depicts Anteros,
the god of requited love.

32:44.923 --> 32:46.425
The Houses of Parliament.

32:46.925 --> 32:51.597
And of course, towering above
is the clock tower, Big Ben.

33:00.063 --> 33:02.816
Is it true you spent 20 years
selling used cars?

33:02.900 --> 33:03.859
Certified pre-owned.

33:12.826 --> 33:15.954
While you were doing that,
I was doing Dad's dirty work.

33:37.059 --> 33:38.435
It's gonna be okay.

33:38.519 --> 33:40.020
The key, Sean.

33:40.103 --> 33:41.104
You want it?

33:43.065 --> 33:44.233
Come get it.

33:46.276 --> 33:47.611
No!

33:54.701 --> 33:55.994
Come on. We gotta get the kids.

34:02.668 --> 34:05.087
You know, Dad, the more people we meet
from your side of the family,

34:05.170 --> 34:06.922
the more I appreciate Mom's side.

34:09.550 --> 34:11.217
Look, I brought you to this restaurant

34:11.301 --> 34:13.469
because there's somebody here
who can help us.

34:13.554 --> 34:15.597
What, like another one
of your murdery coworkers?

34:15.681 --> 34:17.431
Well, that's really nice, Nina.

34:17.516 --> 34:19.351
I can't believe my eyes

34:19.726 --> 34:20.936
Sean McCaffrey

34:21.018 --> 34:22.020
Is it really you?

34:22.521 --> 34:23.981
Good to see you, Zimo

34:24.063 --> 34:25.940
Any chance you still have my bag?

34:26.275 --> 34:28.235
Everything he needs is in here

34:29.902 --> 34:31.989
You saved me from the troubles
in my country

34:33.114 --> 34:34.491
You were the troubles, Zimo

34:38.203 --> 34:40.205
Did you know that Dad could speak Chinese?

34:40.289 --> 34:41.331
No, I didn't.

34:44.918 --> 34:46.295
All right. This should be enough.
We're good.

34:46.378 --> 34:47.379
For what?

34:48.005 --> 34:50.757
We've got a big trip ahead of us.
Everybody eat something, okay?

34:50.841 --> 34:53.677
Could you just, like,
explain the whole uncle situation?

34:55.596 --> 34:57.848
My dad had a house in Ireland.
We'd visit every summer.

34:57.931 --> 35:01.310
The housekeeper there had a kid, Finn.

35:01.935 --> 35:04.021
Yeah. He used to follow me around
like a puppy.

35:04.104 --> 35:07.691
Wait… So your Dad and the housekeeper…

35:07.774 --> 35:09.943
Yes. That's how it works, Kyle.

35:12.029 --> 35:13.155
My dad never said anything.

35:13.238 --> 35:15.574
He certainly never acknowledged
that Finn was his.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.285
I can't imagine what Finn's life
has been like.

35:18.368 --> 35:20.787
Is that sympathy for the guy
that's trying to kill us?

35:20.871 --> 35:22.247
Well, what's worse?

35:22.331 --> 35:24.583
Growing up with a dad like mine
or growing up like Finn?

35:25.125 --> 35:26.210
Totally abandoned.

35:27.002 --> 35:29.171
I mean, how can anybody do that
to their own flesh and blood?

35:29.254 --> 35:31.965
It's like leaving Maxie on the street
to fend for himself.

35:32.049 --> 35:34.009
I'm never letting these guys
out of my sight again.

35:34.092 --> 35:35.260
We've noticed.

35:36.178 --> 35:37.346
So what now?

35:37.429 --> 35:39.556
- We get out of London immediately.
- No.

35:40.224 --> 35:43.227
No, I've got, like,
an entire life here now.

35:43.310 --> 35:45.979
I have classes and I have Omar. I can't.

35:46.063 --> 35:48.148
- That's over, Nina.
- Okay, well, I'm an adult.

35:48.232 --> 35:50.734
So I actually think that
I should be involved in the discussion.

35:50.817 --> 35:51.985
There is no discussion.

35:52.069 --> 35:55.239
With that key, Finn has access
to my father's encrypted server.

35:56.114 --> 35:59.076
That means all of his money,
all of his assassins,

35:59.159 --> 36:00.661
all of his surveillance capabilities.

36:00.744 --> 36:02.663
There's nowhere to hide.
He's gonna find us.

36:03.580 --> 36:06.750
He clearly hates me.
Even though I didn't know, Finn blames me.

36:07.459 --> 36:09.294
- And I can't go to the police.
- Why?

36:13.632 --> 36:15.300
I kinda robbed a bank, okay?

36:15.843 --> 36:17.344
Daddy's bad.

36:17.427 --> 36:19.763
I didn't really rob a bank. They made it
look like I robbed a bank, buddy.

36:19.847 --> 36:21.598
Now everybody thinks that I robbed a bank.

36:21.682 --> 36:22.975
I didn't do it, I promise.

36:25.561 --> 36:30.357
Plus, Finn now has proof of everything
that I did in the past.

36:31.733 --> 36:34.444
It'll be okay. I have a way out of this.
If we can just get to…

36:36.655 --> 36:38.198
Do you mind giving us a second, Omar?

36:38.282 --> 36:39.366
Why?

36:39.449 --> 36:41.076
It's safer if he doesn't know
where we're going.

36:41.159 --> 36:43.495
- He could take his food over there.
- Safer?

36:43.579 --> 36:44.955
Uncle Dickhead saw him with us already.

36:45.038 --> 36:46.415
I don't know if he saw him.

36:46.498 --> 36:47.749
I've been told I'm hard to miss.

36:47.833 --> 36:49.835
Okay, well, then…
He's obviously gonna come, right?

36:49.918 --> 36:51.170
He's… He can come with us.

36:51.253 --> 36:52.296
Do you wanna come?

36:52.379 --> 36:53.672
Yes. I go where you go.

36:56.967 --> 36:59.595
Incroyable. Fine, you're in.

36:59.678 --> 37:00.679
Yes!

37:02.639 --> 37:03.849
In what?

37:03.932 --> 37:05.767
You're in deep shit.

37:47.935 --> 37:49.061
All right.

37:49.144 --> 37:50.604
- We're officially out of UK waters.
- High five.

37:51.772 --> 37:54.691
Cool. Thanks for the exfil no one wanted.

37:55.651 --> 37:56.652
Kyle.

38:01.990 --> 38:03.909
Well, clearly your brother's
never gonna forgive me.

38:05.953 --> 38:07.287
What do you expect?

38:07.371 --> 38:09.873
You flipped our entire world upside down.

38:10.916 --> 38:11.917
Again.

38:13.293 --> 38:17.965
I'm the first person to say that
I think Kyllboi's world is so stupid,

38:18.048 --> 38:21.468
but it's his stupid world.

38:22.302 --> 38:23.345
You know? Like…

38:24.429 --> 38:26.431
The same way that London was mine.

38:27.349 --> 38:29.643
I saw how happy you were there. I'm sorry.

38:32.479 --> 38:35.107
And I know that you guys think
it's, like, crazy thinking

38:35.190 --> 38:38.527
that I could actually
change the world, but I…

38:38.610 --> 38:40.445
No. We don't think it's crazy.

38:40.529 --> 38:43.115
Leaving Buffalo
and actually being in London,

38:44.241 --> 38:48.745
it just felt like it was
actually possible that I could.

38:48.829 --> 38:54.168
And because of your past,
now we're all on the run again,

38:54.251 --> 38:56.587
being chased by a literal maniac.

38:56.670 --> 39:00.090
And, like, maybe let him
be mad for a second.

39:09.349 --> 39:10.350
Thanks.

39:30.204 --> 39:31.205
Hello, Vikram.

39:31.914 --> 39:33.582
Do you know who I am?

39:33.665 --> 39:34.875
I do.

39:34.958 --> 39:36.293
Do you know who I really am?

39:39.213 --> 39:40.464
I'll take that as a yes.

39:41.924 --> 39:43.759
Well, now that dear old Dad's gone,

39:44.259 --> 39:46.595
I've come home to take over
the family business.

39:46.678 --> 39:49.014
If your father had intended that,

39:49.681 --> 39:52.684
he would've found a way
of communicating it to me before he died.

39:57.314 --> 39:58.315
He did.

39:59.316 --> 40:00.442
Welcome home, Master Finn.

41:28.780 --> 41:29.948
All right, old man.

41:33.452 --> 41:34.536
Let's see what you got.

41:40.667 --> 41:42.085
You guys are right.

41:42.169 --> 41:44.838
You shouldn't have to run
from the ghosts of my past anymore.

41:46.423 --> 41:49.301
That's why I'm going to Paris.
We're gonna end this once and for all.

41:49.384 --> 41:50.552
Okay, why Paris?

41:51.553 --> 41:54.473
Well, it's where my brother is now.
It's where I grew up.

41:54.973 --> 41:57.768
What? You grew up in Paris?

41:57.851 --> 41:59.019
I didn't tell you that?

41:59.102 --> 42:00.187
Me too.

42:00.270 --> 42:01.313
Actually, I grew up a bit everywhere.

42:01.897 --> 42:03.190
My father was always traveling
for work and so…

42:03.273 --> 42:04.608
Not now, Omar.

42:05.359 --> 42:08.529
I'm sorry, I thought we were
trying to get away from Uncle Asshole.

42:09.154 --> 42:10.531
He tried to kill us.

42:11.448 --> 42:13.116
Look, I'm gonna get us out of this,
I promise.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.618
But that means no more running.

42:15.202 --> 42:16.453
I gotta take the fight to Finn.

42:16.537 --> 42:20.541
Daddy, could you tell Santa
where we're going so he can find us?

42:21.166 --> 42:22.334
Yes, of course I will, buddy.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.419
Come on, I got a special ride for you.

42:25.504 --> 42:26.839
It's a short ride. Come on.

43:01.748 --> 43:04.501
This is really not what I expected
my first time in Paris to be like.

43:04.585 --> 43:07.045
- No. I think it's kind of romantic.
- Right?

43:07.129 --> 43:08.630
Yeah.

43:09.631 --> 43:10.716
Look.

43:10.799 --> 43:12.759
- The Eiffel Tower! You wanna climb it?
- That's pretty cool.

43:12.843 --> 43:13.927
Oh, my gosh.

43:14.011 --> 43:15.596
- Max, it's magical.
- The city of love.

43:15.679 --> 43:16.972
It's the city of relationships.

43:17.055 --> 43:18.056
Right?

43:18.891 --> 43:20.350
I could use some food,

43:20.434 --> 43:21.935
- or, like, shelter.
- Yes.

43:22.019 --> 43:24.730
Well, I know where we could find both,
but your mother's not gonna like it.

43:24.813 --> 43:26.190
- What?
- Why?

43:26.273 --> 43:28.567
Wait, you mean I'm not gonna like her.

43:29.151 --> 43:31.987
Are we talking super sexy assassin
in the Gwen mold?

43:32.070 --> 43:33.739
No. Svetlana was Russian intelligence.

43:33.822 --> 43:36.116
Svetlana?

43:36.200 --> 43:37.701
It's a typical Russian name, Jess.

43:37.784 --> 43:38.785
- It's like Susan.
- Seriously?

43:38.869 --> 43:40.329
I rest my case.

43:40.412 --> 43:41.997
So you and Svetlana were…

43:42.539 --> 43:43.999
It wasn't serious.

43:44.082 --> 43:46.418
- Purely physical.
- Why are you trying to pick a fight?

43:46.502 --> 43:47.753
I'm sorry. I'm…

43:48.545 --> 43:49.922
All right. This is it.

43:51.089 --> 43:53.509
At least tell me
the rest of her name is ugly.

43:54.468 --> 43:55.719
Svetlana Romanova.

43:55.802 --> 43:57.095
Damn it.

43:57.179 --> 44:00.307
If some ex of yours was the way out
of this mess, I'd be cool with it.

44:00.390 --> 44:02.392
What if his name was Rod McLongDong?

44:03.685 --> 44:05.812
Rod McLongDong. What the…

44:05.896 --> 44:08.899
Well, I'd ask Rod what part
of Scotland the McLongDongs are from

44:08.982 --> 44:10.651
and what pattern their tartan is.

44:10.734 --> 44:11.777
I'm totally cool.

44:11.860 --> 44:13.654
You've got a dirty mind.

44:13.737 --> 44:15.906
- Try not to stare, Kyle. All right?
- I promise nothing.

44:21.245 --> 44:22.913
- Sean!
- Svetlana?

44:22.996 --> 44:24.790
- Oh, God.
- Wow.

44:27.459 --> 44:28.710
Hey. Hold this.

44:28.794 --> 44:30.087
- Okay.
- He's allergic to…

44:30.754 --> 44:32.881
Still so handsome.

44:33.549 --> 44:35.217
No. No, no, no.

44:35.300 --> 44:36.510
Yes, yes, yes.

44:36.593 --> 44:39.638
- No. No. Hi. Yes.
- Hi. I'm Jessica, his wife.

44:39.721 --> 44:41.473
- It is such a joy to meet you.
- Sean.

44:41.557 --> 44:43.976
Where you have been so long time?

44:44.059 --> 44:45.644
- And you don't write.
- In my bed.

44:45.727 --> 44:48.272
I'm so happy to see all of you.

44:48.355 --> 44:49.940
Hi.

44:50.023 --> 44:52.526
- Is this your family?
- Yes. Except for him.

44:52.609 --> 44:55.445
So, what, are you on the run, guys?
You come in?

44:56.238 --> 44:57.614
Holy shit! You have more cats.

45:03.245 --> 45:05.247
Okay. Come in, come in.

45:05.330 --> 45:07.165
- What's that smell?
- Maxie…

45:07.249 --> 45:09.126
Sorry, I don't have Christmas tree.

45:09.209 --> 45:12.963
That requires getting out,
which requires getting dressed.

45:13.046 --> 45:15.799
So sit, sit. My casa is your casa.

45:18.719 --> 45:20.971
Quite the Bonnie and Clyde, eh?

45:24.433 --> 45:25.642
Oh, my God.

45:27.811 --> 45:28.812
It's okay.

45:29.605 --> 45:30.939
The little fiend.

45:31.023 --> 45:32.941
I really do hate to say it,
crime suits you.

45:33.025 --> 45:34.151
You look really hot there.

45:34.234 --> 45:36.528
I am never going to work again.

45:36.612 --> 45:39.448
Don't worry. Just retire like me.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.576
I do crosswords puzzles now.

45:43.076 --> 45:47.414
It's so good for the brains
when we are this age, as women.

45:47.497 --> 45:51.251
So good for brains our age.
You should try it. Very necessary.

45:51.835 --> 45:52.836
She likes crosswords.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.421
Yes. Are you hungry?

45:55.589 --> 45:57.633
- You look hungry.
- I'm starving.

45:57.716 --> 45:59.801
Yes? I just made borscht.

46:00.344 --> 46:01.428
You like borscht, boy?

46:06.642 --> 46:07.893
- Good. Good.
- Delicious.

46:07.976 --> 46:09.144
It's so good.

46:09.228 --> 46:10.312
So good for you.

46:10.896 --> 46:12.439
It's so good.

46:12.523 --> 46:15.108
Yummy, yummy, yummy. In my tummy, tummy.

46:15.734 --> 46:19.154
Do you think you could still get
a message to my father's encrypted server?

46:20.322 --> 46:22.282
But I thought he was dead. Very dead.

46:22.366 --> 46:24.701
Yes, he is.
But somebody new has taken over.

46:25.786 --> 46:27.329
What happened to you taking over?

46:28.247 --> 46:29.957
Well, I went a different direction
a long time ago.

46:30.040 --> 46:31.041
I'm a dad now, a husband.

46:31.834 --> 46:33.794
Deep cover. I like it.

46:35.254 --> 46:38.090
You need to get close
to her Dad or something?

46:38.173 --> 46:40.425
No, he's a wonderful father-in-law

46:41.051 --> 46:43.011
Yeah, of course he is.

46:44.638 --> 46:45.848
Such a sweet couple.

46:45.931 --> 46:46.932
Borscht.

46:49.434 --> 46:51.061
I'll be damned.

46:51.144 --> 46:52.271
Max never eats anything.

46:52.354 --> 46:55.732
This is a good boy. I like this one.

46:56.775 --> 46:58.318
What is your problem? Eat.

46:58.402 --> 46:59.736
- Kyle.
- I'm so sorry about him.

46:59.820 --> 47:00.988
No, I just… I ate…

47:01.071 --> 47:02.364
Eat!

47:08.036 --> 47:09.121
I like this one.

47:23.969 --> 47:25.554
- Finn's agreed to meet.
- Meet?

47:26.972 --> 47:28.724
I have to try to reason with him, Jess.

47:29.558 --> 47:32.019
He did not seem like
he was reasonable, Dan.

47:33.604 --> 47:36.648
Would you be doing this with Finn
if he wasn't your brother?

47:36.732 --> 47:38.066
No, probably not.

47:38.150 --> 47:40.694
But I can't just take him out
like some thug my dad sent, Jess.

47:40.777 --> 47:41.820
He's my blood.

47:42.487 --> 47:44.072
Finn was a good kid back then.

47:44.156 --> 47:45.741
My dad made him this way.

47:47.034 --> 47:48.702
I have to try.

47:50.120 --> 47:51.288
Where are you gonna meet?

47:51.997 --> 47:53.749
At a museum. I know it well.

47:54.458 --> 47:56.460
There are metal detectors.
Finn won't be armed.

47:56.543 --> 47:58.462
I won't approach
if I sense anything's wrong.

48:00.255 --> 48:01.465
I'll be careful.

48:36.917 --> 48:39.253
Well, you've got some balls
asking for a meet.

48:40.337 --> 48:41.421
Yet here you are.

48:43.632 --> 48:45.551
It's strange being back in this city.

48:45.634 --> 48:47.928
It makes Dad being gone feel real somehow.

48:48.679 --> 48:50.681
He was gone for me my whole life.

48:52.724 --> 48:53.892
When I was 12,

48:54.518 --> 48:58.146
I waited outside your mansion
in the freezing rain for hours,

48:59.022 --> 49:01.650
just to catch a glimpse
of the life you had.

49:02.568 --> 49:04.903
Eventually, you came out,

49:04.987 --> 49:09.700
the two of you, wearing matching peacoats,
the kind you get in the navy.

49:11.285 --> 49:13.620
And although you looked like…

49:15.163 --> 49:17.249
well, like twats,

49:19.042 --> 49:20.669
I was so jealous.

49:20.752 --> 49:24.590
I wanted to run after you,
yell at you both that I'm your blood.

49:25.174 --> 49:27.426
But my legs were numb from the cold.

49:29.386 --> 49:33.807
And you walked off,
Dad looking at you with pride.

49:33.891 --> 49:35.309
It wasn't like you thought, Finn.

49:36.310 --> 49:37.644
I left that life behind.

49:38.604 --> 49:40.606
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

49:41.148 --> 49:43.108
That you didn't even want
what you were given?

49:43.192 --> 49:44.401
I'm telling you you were better off.

49:44.484 --> 49:46.945
That's easy for you to say,
Daddy's Little Prince.

49:47.738 --> 49:49.573
- Don't call me that.
- What, Daddy's Little Prince?

49:54.161 --> 49:55.537
I said, "Don't call me that."

49:58.498 --> 49:59.958
You do know Dad tried to kill me, right?

50:00.042 --> 50:01.043
Yeah.

50:01.543 --> 50:02.961
Frankly, you had it coming.

50:03.795 --> 50:05.297
You and Dad are the same.

50:05.380 --> 50:07.299
You both abandoned your flesh and blood.

50:07.382 --> 50:09.384
I would die for my flesh and blood.

50:09.468 --> 50:10.928
There's nothing more important
than family.

50:11.011 --> 50:12.179
I was your family.

50:12.804 --> 50:14.014
Don't you get it, Finn?

50:14.097 --> 50:15.516
If I'd have known you were my brother,

50:15.599 --> 50:18.227
I'd have been a brother to you
from the very beginning.

50:18.310 --> 50:21.146
I called this meeting
to tell you it's not too late.

50:21.730 --> 50:24.149
You end this right now,
stop trying to be Dad,

50:24.233 --> 50:25.609
we could still be brothers.

50:25.692 --> 50:26.944
That's your pitch?

50:28.445 --> 50:31.698
I give up an entire empire
of limitless resources

50:31.782 --> 50:34.117
and in return I get you?

50:34.701 --> 50:35.702
For what?

50:36.912 --> 50:38.497
Barbecues and football?

50:38.580 --> 50:40.499
Swapping birthday cards?

50:40.582 --> 50:41.583
Piss off.

50:43.418 --> 50:48.048
Listen, little boy, Dad wasn't great.
He was a psycho, all right?

50:48.131 --> 50:50.551
Take his money if you want.
I don't give a shit.

50:50.634 --> 50:51.844
But don't become him.

50:51.927 --> 50:53.262
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands.

50:53.345 --> 50:55.013
Now you wanna play big brother?

50:56.557 --> 50:57.683
Dad's dead, all right?

50:57.766 --> 51:00.227
There's nothing to prove to him or me.

51:00.310 --> 51:01.520
Let it go.

51:04.147 --> 51:06.149
Yeah, I can't do that, big brother.

51:10.487 --> 51:11.989
I'm taking what's mine.

51:12.865 --> 51:16.368
I'm not waiting outside
in the cold any longer.

51:17.619 --> 51:18.787
I'm sorry to hear that.

51:20.581 --> 51:22.165
I'd hoped to get through to you.

51:23.333 --> 51:24.585
Clearly, I can't.

51:25.586 --> 51:27.087
So I'm gonna warn you instead.

51:29.131 --> 51:30.632
Call this whole thing off.

51:31.216 --> 51:32.843
Or what?

51:32.926 --> 51:35.095
Or I will show you
who Dad trained me to be.

51:36.346 --> 51:38.515
I've been Dan Morgan so far.

51:38.599 --> 51:41.852
A loving father, husband, family man.

51:43.020 --> 51:44.730
You don't wanna meet Sean McCaffrey.

51:44.813 --> 51:46.398
Ain't no love there.

51:51.195 --> 51:54.781
You talk a big game, Little Prince.

52:01.246 --> 52:02.748
Come near my family again…

52:04.875 --> 52:06.293
I'm gonna tear you apart.

52:27.898 --> 52:28.941
Are they here?

52:29.024 --> 52:30.108
They are, sir.

52:44.373 --> 52:49.044
My knobhead of a brother
came to Paris to try to stop me.

52:50.379 --> 52:53.966
Whoever stops him gets triple their rate.

52:56.510 --> 52:58.136
You take what you need.

52:58.929 --> 52:59.930
In here.

53:02.683 --> 53:05.644
Your wife look very sad. Be nice.

53:05.727 --> 53:06.728
I know.

53:11.900 --> 53:12.901
Hey.

53:14.194 --> 53:16.613
I guess this means it didn't go very well.

53:18.532 --> 53:19.533
Yeah.

53:21.285 --> 53:22.911
How's the mood out there?

53:22.995 --> 53:24.413
How do you think?

53:24.496 --> 53:27.249
This isn't the Christmas
that we envisioned, Dan.

53:28.375 --> 53:29.793
We're in Paris at Christmas.

53:30.544 --> 53:31.753
We just make it special.

53:32.504 --> 53:33.755
Come on. Get the kids.

53:39.386 --> 53:41.805
- Oh, my gosh. What?
- Wow.

53:42.472 --> 53:43.473
Wow.

53:49.605 --> 53:52.774
Maxie, we live in Buffalo.
We see snow all the time.

53:52.858 --> 53:55.068
But the snow tastes different here.

53:56.069 --> 53:57.154
Good boy.

53:58.488 --> 53:59.489
Love you, buddy.

54:08.207 --> 54:09.208
Hey, Daddy.

54:37.653 --> 54:40.239
Tonight, I got exactly
what I've been looking for.

54:40.322 --> 54:41.323
What's that?

54:41.406 --> 54:43.325
Time with my family.

54:44.201 --> 54:46.411
Man, life can get complicated.

54:46.495 --> 54:47.788
No shit.

54:47.871 --> 54:49.373
- I mean, right?
- Yes.

54:49.456 --> 54:53.752
I mean, you try to juggle a career,
relationships, raising kids.

54:53.836 --> 54:56.588
And then, somehow, in spite of
everything you do to hold it all together,

54:56.672 --> 54:57.840
it somehow just…

54:58.882 --> 55:00.384
It slips right through your fingers.

55:00.926 --> 55:03.512
But then you have a night like tonight,
and it's all worth it.

55:03.595 --> 55:06.557
And it's all because of you.
Thank you for helping me and my family.

55:06.640 --> 55:07.641
My little boy…

55:09.935 --> 55:11.770
I'm such as asshole.

55:11.854 --> 55:12.855
What?

55:13.605 --> 55:17.067
Sean, your brother put out the bounty
to end all bounties.

55:17.150 --> 55:19.486
But I swear I wasn't going to kill you.

55:19.987 --> 55:22.281
You were just gonna hand me over
to Finn and let him do it?

55:22.364 --> 55:24.992
Work is slow. Cats are expensive.

55:25.742 --> 55:26.743
Come on.

55:26.827 --> 55:30.914
But now here you are with all this
"I love my family" business.

55:30.998 --> 55:33.876
And your little boy, he was so sweet.

55:33.959 --> 55:37.588
He ate my soup,
and now I am starting to feel bad.

55:37.671 --> 55:38.714
Shit.

55:38.797 --> 55:40.174
- Be careful.
- All right.

55:40.257 --> 55:41.967
- Are they coming?
- I'm starting to feel bad.

55:42.050 --> 55:43.135
- You should.
- Yes.

55:43.218 --> 55:44.845
Hey. Are they coming?

55:44.928 --> 55:46.346
- Afraid so.
- They're coming here?

55:46.430 --> 55:48.182
- They're coming here now…
- Now?

55:48.265 --> 55:50.225
- Oh, my God. Jessica. Jessica!
- …because I am such an asshole!

55:50.309 --> 55:51.393
Jessica.

55:51.476 --> 55:53.937
Guys, wake up. We gotta go. We gotta go.

55:54.021 --> 55:55.147
Dan, what's wrong?

55:55.230 --> 55:56.398
- We got trouble.
- What's wrong?

55:56.481 --> 55:57.900
Oh, my…

55:57.983 --> 55:59.276
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

56:01.028 --> 56:02.779
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Are you drunk?

56:02.863 --> 56:04.323
What the hell, Dan?

56:04.406 --> 56:05.407
- Drugs.
- Drugs.

56:05.490 --> 56:06.491
Not drunk.

56:06.575 --> 56:08.118
- They gave me a drug.
- Oh, my God.

56:08.202 --> 56:09.745
What did he take?

56:09.828 --> 56:13.749
My own blend
of sodium acetate and Rohypnol.

56:13.832 --> 56:15.751
- God, so you roofied my dad?
- What?

56:15.834 --> 56:17.669
Yes, roofie. I roofied him.

56:17.753 --> 56:18.712
Are you out of your mind?

56:18.795 --> 56:20.881
Honey, easy. I'm trying to help you.

56:20.964 --> 56:22.591
By drugging my husband?

56:22.674 --> 56:24.927
- That was then. We're at now.
- She used to do it all the time.

56:25.010 --> 56:26.637
That was literally two minutes ago
when you did that.

56:26.720 --> 56:30.015
- They're coming.
- And a lot can change in a minute, baby.

56:30.098 --> 56:32.100
Oh, my God. Omar, Kyle, let's go.

56:32.184 --> 56:33.936
- Oh, my God.
- He really love you guys.

56:34.019 --> 56:35.145
Even you, Jessica.

56:35.229 --> 56:36.688
I'm okay. I'm fine.

56:36.772 --> 56:39.441
Unfortunately, what he said was true.
They are coming.

56:39.525 --> 56:41.777
- So you might want to skedaddle.
- Here?

56:41.860 --> 56:43.820
All right, get the jackets.
And you're letting us go?

56:44.321 --> 56:45.864
Please, I wish you would.

56:45.948 --> 56:46.949
Let me talk to Mommy.

56:47.032 --> 56:49.076
You think I want this shit to go down
in my apartment?

56:49.159 --> 56:51.370
You're trashing the place.
Here, take my car.

56:51.453 --> 56:52.955
I will never understand the moral code
of these people.

56:53.038 --> 56:54.373
Here. Go.

56:54.456 --> 56:56.083
Oh, my God. There's cat shit everywhere.

57:00.587 --> 57:02.172
Oh, my God.

57:03.215 --> 57:04.591
Are you kidding me?

57:06.760 --> 57:07.761
Come on.

57:07.845 --> 57:09.763
It's not exactly a getaway car.

57:10.681 --> 57:11.682
Okay, all right.

57:11.765 --> 57:13.350
Oh, God.

57:13.433 --> 57:14.977
Okay, this is gonna be a tight squeeze.

57:28.115 --> 57:29.616
There's a man outside.

57:36.874 --> 57:38.083
Okay.

57:40.377 --> 57:41.628
- You okay, Daddy?
- I'm your daddy.

57:41.712 --> 57:43.088
Daddy.

57:43.172 --> 57:44.673
What about the garage door?

57:44.756 --> 57:46.508
Go through it.

57:46.592 --> 57:48.093
I don't know if I can do it.
He's right there.

57:48.177 --> 57:49.803
What? Of course you can.

57:49.887 --> 57:52.556
You're an adult now.
What would your dad do?

57:52.639 --> 57:54.266
Your daddy.

57:54.850 --> 57:56.768
- I'm your daddy. Big daddy.
- If he were awake.

57:57.352 --> 57:59.938
- Protect his family.
- That's right.

58:07.321 --> 58:08.822
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. It just went.

58:08.906 --> 58:11.658
- Why are there three pedals?
- Oh, God. It's a stick.

58:11.742 --> 58:13.952
- All right, left pedal.
- Okay.

58:15.454 --> 58:17.623
Right pedal. Go!

58:26.590 --> 58:27.758
You need to go faster.

58:27.841 --> 58:29.885
- I can't. This car is slow as shit.
- Wait, you're still in first.

58:29.968 --> 58:31.386
- Does he not know how to drive?
- Apparently not.

58:31.470 --> 58:33.055
- What do I do?
- Left pedal.

58:33.805 --> 58:34.932
Right pedal.

58:36.808 --> 58:38.602
Okay! You got it, okay?

58:40.437 --> 58:41.897
He's trying to kill us. Go.

58:42.648 --> 58:43.649
Oh, my God.

58:48.362 --> 58:50.572
Sorry. He drives like his mother.

58:50.656 --> 58:51.907
What?

58:53.075 --> 58:53.951
Cut across!

59:00.582 --> 59:02.501
See, see, see! Go left! Oh, my God.

59:06.797 --> 59:09.049
I wanna take you to eat
at that restaurant.

59:12.594 --> 59:14.304
We need to go faster.

59:14.388 --> 59:15.973
Omar!

59:16.932 --> 59:18.183
- Oh, my God.
- Happy New Year.

59:18.267 --> 59:19.518
- Oh, my God, Dad. Stay down.
- Happy New Year.

59:22.312 --> 59:24.565
- That car's coming straight for us.
- They're trying to kill us! Turn!

59:27.609 --> 59:28.861
Let's get some clams over there.

59:28.944 --> 59:30.904
- Shut up, Dan.
- Okay, Mommy.

59:33.991 --> 59:35.200
They're right on our tail.

59:35.284 --> 59:36.618
Let me drive.

59:36.702 --> 59:38.036
I'm not letting you drive, Dad.

59:41.623 --> 59:43.083
- Let me drive.
- No.

59:45.419 --> 59:46.962
Faster, faster.

59:47.045 --> 59:48.589
I'm going as fast as I can.

59:55.512 --> 59:57.181
Oh, my God. Did you just see that?

59:59.016 --> 59:59.975
We're seconds away

01:00:02.227 --> 01:00:03.061
Another car!

01:00:05.939 --> 01:00:08.358
Sorry. It's drink and drugs.

01:00:11.111 --> 01:00:12.154
Right turn, Kyle.

01:00:21.872 --> 01:00:23.165
Shit!

01:00:25.167 --> 01:00:27.252
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:00:27.336 --> 01:00:28.337
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:00:31.507 --> 01:00:33.258
Are your family holidays always like this?

01:00:34.801 --> 01:00:36.053
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:00:38.055 --> 01:00:40.140
Roller coaster!

01:00:44.811 --> 01:00:46.146
West towards La Pigalle

01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:49.274
I see them

01:00:49.358 --> 01:00:51.902
Shit. It's the red car again. Turn left.

01:00:52.819 --> 01:00:53.779
Sh…

01:00:57.699 --> 01:00:59.076
We'll cut them off at the intersection

01:01:00.536 --> 01:01:02.913
He's getting closer.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.839
Guys, there's an intersection.
Should I slow down?

01:01:11.922 --> 01:01:12.965
- No!
- No, no!

01:01:13.048 --> 01:01:14.550
Drive, Kyle!

01:01:16.093 --> 01:01:17.344
Oh, my God!

01:01:23.183 --> 01:01:24.977
Oh, my God. We did it. We did it.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.520
Yay!

01:01:26.603 --> 01:01:28.105
I'm never driving again.

01:01:28.188 --> 01:01:29.356
Oh, my God.

01:01:29.439 --> 01:01:30.732
Whose itty-bitty car is this?

01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:50.419
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01:53.881 --> 01:01:55.465
I thought I could make him listen.

01:01:56.466 --> 01:01:57.885
You did what you thought was right.

01:02:03.891 --> 01:02:04.892
So, what now?

01:02:05.434 --> 01:02:07.269
I gotta get you guys somewhere safe.

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:10.355
Somewhere we can still have a normal life.

01:02:12.733 --> 01:02:13.984
They think you robbed a bank, Jess.

01:02:14.067 --> 01:02:15.068
Us.

01:02:15.152 --> 01:02:17.279
You're not going to jail, okay?

01:02:19.156 --> 01:02:20.240
But what about you?

01:02:21.658 --> 01:02:22.951
I'll figure it out.

01:02:23.035 --> 01:02:25.162
You guys being around me
is only gonna put you in danger.

01:02:25.245 --> 01:02:27.247
I'm not doing that anymore.

01:02:28.624 --> 01:02:29.875
You're wrong, Dad.

01:02:30.459 --> 01:02:31.668
We're stronger together.

01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:34.421
Yeah. Remember Vegas?

01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:37.716
Look, can we just…
Can we talk about this together?

01:02:37.799 --> 01:02:39.468
We can figure it out as a family.

01:02:46.725 --> 01:02:49.728
Okay. So let's just do
a recap of our options.

01:02:50.229 --> 01:02:52.397
So if we leave together now,

01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:55.734
then we just have to give up
being the Morgans

01:02:56.568 --> 01:03:02.407
and be the Andersons and live on the run
from Finn and the police forever.

01:03:04.743 --> 01:03:05.911
I say no to that plan.

01:03:05.994 --> 01:03:07.538
- Me too.
- Me three.

01:03:07.621 --> 01:03:08.622
- Me four.
- Me four.

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:12.960
Sorry.

01:03:13.043 --> 01:03:16.463
Or we turn ourselves in to the authorities

01:03:16.547 --> 01:03:19.550
and Finn outs you as Sean McCaffrey,

01:03:19.633 --> 01:03:24.346
and that means you have to go to jail
for, like, ever. So…

01:03:24.847 --> 01:03:30.227
And everyone you ever wronged
might still come after us, so pass.

01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:31.436
- Pass.
- Hard pass.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.564
You're not going to jail, Dad.

01:03:33.647 --> 01:03:34.982
I should call my dad.

01:03:35.816 --> 01:03:38.110
Look, I love you so much,
but it's just really…

01:03:38.193 --> 01:03:39.361
The family bonding is probably a trigger.

01:03:39.444 --> 01:03:41.405
- No. It's not that. No. It's not…
- It's just that… It's really--

01:03:41.488 --> 01:03:44.491
We're never gonna be safe as long as
Finn has control of my dad's network.

01:03:45.158 --> 01:03:46.743
- I have an idea.
- I have an idea.

01:03:55.711 --> 01:03:57.462
Finn will know I'm coming for him.

01:03:57.546 --> 01:03:58.672
He'll be prepared.

01:03:59.173 --> 01:04:01.466
We need to take down
the McCaffrey encrypted server,

01:04:01.967 --> 01:04:04.845
and to do that we have to get into
the house where I grew up.

01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:06.430
It's right there. Take a look.

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:08.932
Wait, that's the house you grew up in?

01:04:09.766 --> 01:04:11.935
House is an understatement.

01:04:13.228 --> 01:04:14.897
I'm sorry.
Have we been rich this whole time?

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:18.233
Are you seriously telling me
that's where you spent your childhood?

01:04:18.317 --> 01:04:20.152
If you can call it a childhood, yeah.

01:04:21.195 --> 01:04:22.279
Oh, my God.

01:04:22.362 --> 01:04:24.031
Oh, God. Vikram.

01:04:25.032 --> 01:04:26.033
Who?

01:04:26.116 --> 01:04:27.159
Wait. Who's Vikram?

01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:28.952
He was our butler.

01:04:29.036 --> 01:04:30.621
I'm sorry. Butler?

01:04:31.371 --> 01:04:33.040
You had a butler,
Mr. Clean Up After Yourself?

01:04:33.123 --> 01:04:34.541
- "Do all your own dishes."
- Exactly.

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:36.418
Okay, I get it. That's enough.

01:04:36.502 --> 01:04:38.545
I'm gonna hold this over you forever.

01:04:40.005 --> 01:04:41.173
So, what's the plan?

01:04:41.757 --> 01:04:43.592
Security is tight at the best of times.

01:04:43.675 --> 01:04:46.261
Right now, Finn's got the most
lethal assassins on payroll.

01:04:46.345 --> 01:04:49.389
The mansion will be heavily guarded,
with surveillance cameras everywhere.

01:04:50.641 --> 01:04:52.100
Best way in is on the roof.

01:04:52.184 --> 01:04:53.977
We've got comms, body cams,

01:04:54.061 --> 01:04:55.437
four-and-a-half Morgans,

01:04:57.397 --> 01:04:58.857
one Omar,

01:04:58.941 --> 01:05:01.318
and some surveillance equipment
from Svetlana's place.

01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:04.279
Dad, if you get this into the terminal,

01:05:04.363 --> 01:05:07.032
I can wipe the mainframe
and all of the files.

01:05:07.658 --> 01:05:10.577
No more secret assassin network.
No more Sean McCaffrey.

01:05:16.166 --> 01:05:18.669
Look, we're also gonna need
a distraction on the street.

01:05:18.752 --> 01:05:19.753
You know anybody?

01:05:21.088 --> 01:05:22.840
Think I can call a few people.

01:05:23.382 --> 01:05:26.009
Jess, while I'm inside,
you're calling the shots outside.

01:05:26.093 --> 01:05:28.387
If anything goes wrong,
you all abort and disappear.

01:05:29.054 --> 01:05:30.514
Become the Andersons.

01:05:30.597 --> 01:05:32.766
Is that clear? That's the code word.

01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:36.645
It's nonnegotiable.

01:05:37.145 --> 01:05:38.146
Got it.

01:05:38.856 --> 01:05:41.024
Mom says to abort, you go. That's it.

01:05:43.902 --> 01:05:45.487
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:48.532
Maxie,

01:05:49.616 --> 01:05:51.368
it's gonna be okay, buddy.

01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:57.624
Wanna go for a climb with me?

01:05:59.168 --> 01:06:00.460
I like roofs.

01:06:00.544 --> 01:06:01.962
It would be an honor, Daddy.

01:06:03.422 --> 01:06:04.673
Dan.

01:06:09.219 --> 01:06:10.762
All right, everybody, get it in.

01:06:10.846 --> 01:06:12.181
Come on, for the Morgans.

01:06:12.264 --> 01:06:13.432
On three.

01:06:14.766 --> 01:06:15.767
Morgans.

01:06:16.268 --> 01:06:18.687
- I gotta say "three" first, dude.
- Sorry.

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:21.690
On three. One, two, three.

01:06:21.773 --> 01:06:22.858
Morgans!

01:06:32.242 --> 01:06:34.494
All right,
we're parked just west of the mansion.

01:06:34.578 --> 01:06:35.954
All right. Thanks, Jess. Stand by.

01:06:58.143 --> 01:06:59.102
Body cams are live.

01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:01.438
Nina, you figure out that mic yet?

01:07:02.189 --> 01:07:04.441
Yeah. Actually, this thing's awesome.
I'm keeping it.

01:07:15.369 --> 01:07:16.828
God, what are they doing?

01:07:17.913 --> 01:07:19.790
- That's horrible.
- What are you doing with that?

01:07:19.873 --> 01:07:22.167
Yeah. Seriously, perv. Gross.

01:07:22.793 --> 01:07:23.794
Really?

01:07:34.972 --> 01:07:37.766
Dad, I'm picking up
some walkie-talkie frequencies.

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:40.143
Copy, Kyle.
We're approaching another camera.

01:07:40.227 --> 01:07:42.229
I'm scrubbing for radio frequencies now.

01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:58.912
Nina, roll tape on this.

01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:01.039
You go left. I'll go right.

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:04.418
Recording.

01:08:09.089 --> 01:08:14.511
Omar, on my mark, drop down.
In three, two, one. Go.

01:08:16.054 --> 01:08:17.514
Hey, Harry.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.185
Sean McCaffrey. You cheeky prick.

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.314
Twenty years ago,
you'd have shot me in the back.

01:08:25.397 --> 01:08:26.814
I'm not that guy anymore.

01:08:27.482 --> 01:08:30.109
- Good. He was an arsehole.
- Couldn't agree more.

01:08:31.653 --> 01:08:33.447
Why don't you tie yourself
to that railing?

01:08:38.868 --> 01:08:40.120
Bite me.

01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:44.291
Dan?

01:08:47.002 --> 01:08:47.961
I'm here.

01:08:48.045 --> 01:08:49.296
Okay.

01:08:49.379 --> 01:08:51.965
Harry, have you seen any movement
on the rooftops?

01:08:52.049 --> 01:08:54.635
Hey, Kyle.
We're gonna need an answer quick.

01:08:54.718 --> 01:08:56.136
- Okay.
- You got this.

01:08:59.973 --> 01:09:01.517
Harry, I said report.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.727
- Come on, Kyle.
- Nina, give me a second.

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:04.810
Okay, got something.

01:09:05.604 --> 01:09:07.773
You cheeky prick.

01:09:10.108 --> 01:09:14.988
Listen, wanker. When you work for me,
you do things as I say. Is that clear?

01:09:15.072 --> 01:09:16.573
You've got this, Kyle. Come on.

01:09:17.198 --> 01:09:18.492
Arsehole.

01:09:21.203 --> 01:09:22.703
Would my dad have put up with this?

01:09:22.787 --> 01:09:27.501
There are many things about this situation
your father would have found unacceptable.

01:09:30.671 --> 01:09:32.089
Just keep your eyes open.

01:09:32.881 --> 01:09:34.049
You rock.

01:09:35.551 --> 01:09:37.094
Great save, Kyle.

01:09:45.978 --> 01:09:48.229
There's one last camera. Take it out.

01:09:53.527 --> 01:09:57.614
Is that Omar's friends? Yes! Yes.
They came. Okay. Let's go.

01:10:01.201 --> 01:10:02.619
There's so many.

01:10:02.703 --> 01:10:06.707
You know the problem
with these big oil companies is…

01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:10.460
…they're prioritizing profit over people
and the planet

01:10:20.137 --> 01:10:22.514
Omar, your real dad would be proud.

01:10:23.891 --> 01:10:28.979
The CEO of Paxcore is taking
his private plane to his private yacht…

01:10:29.062 --> 01:10:32.065
…and you know where
that oil-spilling fat cat lives?

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:33.358
Right there!

01:10:36.486 --> 01:10:39.740
Stop oil pollution! Climate revolution!

01:10:43.869 --> 01:10:45.871
Who are you arseholes?

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.081
Come on, Dad.

01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:50.959
You're gonna change the world
one day, Beans.

01:10:52.252 --> 01:10:53.253
I know.

01:10:53.337 --> 01:10:55.839
Are you the organizer of this protest?

01:10:55.923 --> 01:10:57.174
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

01:10:57.257 --> 01:10:58.592
Can I see your identity card?

01:10:58.675 --> 01:10:59.676
I have my passport. But it's in my bag.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.136
Do you speak French or not at all?

01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:09.895
Madame…

01:11:09.978 --> 01:11:11.897
- You have nothing on you?
- I don't have it on me.

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:13.357
Okay, let's move aside a little

01:11:19.404 --> 01:11:20.948
Long live the revolution!

01:11:38.799 --> 01:11:40.926
That's romantic.

01:11:41.009 --> 01:11:43.053
Are you gonna marry Omar?

01:11:52.104 --> 01:11:53.105
Pricks.

01:12:00.153 --> 01:12:01.154
Hey.

01:12:02.698 --> 01:12:04.741
Excuse me, Dad. Is that your stash?

01:12:04.825 --> 01:12:06.076
- Let me see.
- Wait, what?

01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:07.327
Hey, I was a teenager too.

01:12:07.411 --> 01:12:09.079
You had Samir's garage.

01:12:09.162 --> 01:12:10.873
Nina had that hollowed-out book.

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.041
What, you knew about that?

01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:15.043
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding me?

01:12:15.127 --> 01:12:16.378
And this is all mine.

01:12:16.461 --> 01:12:17.963
What's a stash?

01:12:18.046 --> 01:12:19.047
Shut up.

01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:21.466
And here's the real key to the castle.

01:12:22.551 --> 01:12:24.845
Wait. Hold on, Dad. Isn't it alarmed?

01:12:24.928 --> 01:12:26.680
No, I rerouted the wire in '94.

01:12:27.389 --> 01:12:30.017
The question is whether they ever noticed.

01:12:32.603 --> 01:12:33.604
Nope.

01:12:40.861 --> 01:12:41.862
I don't buy it.

01:13:22.277 --> 01:13:24.279
I can't believe he kept all of this.

01:13:24.363 --> 01:13:25.447
I can.

01:13:30.118 --> 01:13:32.120
Welcome home, Little Prince.

01:13:32.871 --> 01:13:34.957
- Oh, my God. That's Finn.
- Shit.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:39.503
When we were kids, you told me about your
way in and out of your castle in Paris.

01:13:40.254 --> 01:13:41.839
You called it your…

01:13:43.465 --> 01:13:44.550
Secret passage.

01:13:44.633 --> 01:13:45.634
Yeah.

01:13:47.845 --> 01:13:48.887
Is that my coat?

01:13:48.971 --> 01:13:49.972
It is.

01:13:51.139 --> 01:13:52.391
I think it suits me.

01:13:53.141 --> 01:13:56.228
This coat, this house.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:58.021
Look, Finn…

01:13:58.105 --> 01:14:01.275
Don't. Goodbye, brother.

01:14:01.358 --> 01:14:02.818
If I may, sir.

01:14:02.901 --> 01:14:05.237
We have a room for things like this.

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.114
It's good to see you too, Vikram.

01:14:07.614 --> 01:14:08.699
Sir.

01:14:10.868 --> 01:14:11.869
Go on.

01:14:22.921 --> 01:14:23.922
Jess…

01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:27.176
Andersons.

01:14:34.683 --> 01:14:35.684
Dan?

01:14:35.767 --> 01:14:37.102
Is your family here?

01:14:40.689 --> 01:14:42.691
Is that your missus you're talking to?

01:14:50.866 --> 01:14:53.285
See, I don't know what Andersons means,

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:55.954
but I would take it as…

01:14:59.791 --> 01:15:00.876
"Goodbye."

01:15:06.006 --> 01:15:07.007
Oh, God.

01:15:07.508 --> 01:15:09.301
We have to do something.

01:15:09.384 --> 01:15:11.887
No, your dad was clear
about what we had to do.

01:15:13.096 --> 01:15:14.097
Go on.

01:15:17.684 --> 01:15:19.019
Is Dad okay?

01:15:19.102 --> 01:15:20.729
Mom, there's… Look.

01:15:22.314 --> 01:15:23.732
That's my flash drive. It's not moving.

01:15:23.815 --> 01:15:24.900
Dad must have dropped it.

01:15:24.983 --> 01:15:27.152
We can save him
if we get control of the main computer.

01:15:27.236 --> 01:15:30.906
No, he said if the plan went wrong,
that I had to get you outta here.

01:15:33.909 --> 01:15:36.245
But he also said
that I was the one who is in charge.

01:15:41.834 --> 01:15:43.168
I'm calling an audible.

01:15:44.169 --> 01:15:47.256
If anything goes wrong,
you head to the US embassy.

01:15:47.923 --> 01:15:51.343
I'm going in there to finish this
and to save your dad.

01:16:06.608 --> 01:16:07.693
Go, Mom.

01:17:07.586 --> 01:17:09.463
She's not seriously thinking of…

01:17:09.546 --> 01:17:11.381
Holy shit. She is.

01:17:11.465 --> 01:17:13.509
Mom, don't even think about that.

01:17:13.592 --> 01:17:15.093
It's way too far.

01:17:15.177 --> 01:17:16.929
- I pulled it off in Vegas.
- Did you?

01:17:17.012 --> 01:17:18.472
Because I remember it very differently.

01:17:18.555 --> 01:17:20.349
In college, I could jump 18 feet.

01:17:21.183 --> 01:17:23.810
Okay. It feels like the first two words
are very relevant here.

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.361
I got this.

01:17:37.241 --> 01:17:38.992
Oh, God. I can't look.

01:17:45.749 --> 01:17:46.875
Yes!

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:50.462
Mommy flew!

01:17:51.505 --> 01:17:52.589
I still got it!

01:17:52.673 --> 01:17:54.842
Shit. Now I'm kinda mad I missed it.

01:17:58.971 --> 01:18:01.473
What kinda man brings
his whole family here?

01:18:02.391 --> 01:18:04.893
And there I was thinking
you were a good dad.

01:18:06.353 --> 01:18:07.938
Find them. They're close.

01:18:08.564 --> 01:18:10.023
You, check upstairs now.

01:18:42.514 --> 01:18:43.932
I got the thingamajiggy.

01:18:44.016 --> 01:18:45.642
Hurry, Mom. Get to the server.

01:18:45.726 --> 01:18:47.144
Got it.

01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:01.283
Down you go, Little Prince.

01:19:04.453 --> 01:19:06.455
Oh, my God. This place is huge.

01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:19.510
Hey, Vikram. Remember when Dad
locked me down here in the dark

01:19:19.593 --> 01:19:21.512
for four days for talking back to him?

01:19:21.595 --> 01:19:23.013
I remember it working.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.058
Over the drain, please.

01:19:32.648 --> 01:19:35.567
You know, it's good to see you're still
the same ray of sunshine, Vikram.

01:19:36.109 --> 01:19:37.778
I mean, you really think
my dad would want this?

01:19:42.324 --> 01:19:43.492
Well,

01:19:43.575 --> 01:19:44.952
say hello to Dad for me.

01:19:56.922 --> 01:19:58.340
That was foolish, Vikram.

01:19:59.675 --> 01:20:01.885
I guess there's no such thing
as loyalty anymore.

01:20:01.969 --> 01:20:03.220
On the contrary.

01:20:03.303 --> 01:20:05.722
My loyalty will always be
with your father.

01:20:06.348 --> 01:20:07.683
And despite their differences,

01:20:07.766 --> 01:20:10.853
there is no question as to which son
he'd want me to protect.

01:20:17.776 --> 01:20:18.777
Find him.

01:20:30.581 --> 01:20:31.582
Did it work?

01:20:33.876 --> 01:20:35.460
- We're in!
- Yes.

01:20:36.712 --> 01:20:38.422
Accessing the CCTV.

01:20:40.632 --> 01:20:42.718
Okay. Okay, we can see you.

01:20:42.801 --> 01:20:45.053
- Where's your dad?
- I'll start scanning other feeds.

01:20:45.679 --> 01:20:47.014
Shit.

01:20:49.892 --> 01:20:53.020
Mom. Mom, you have company.
You need to find a different way out.

01:21:05.741 --> 01:21:06.950
Mom, she's coming.

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:11.496
You need to hide.

01:21:40.776 --> 01:21:41.944
Hey, Finn!

01:21:43.779 --> 01:21:45.447
I may not have wanted it,

01:21:45.531 --> 01:21:47.282
but this is my house, Little Brother.

01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:58.460
She's right there.
You have to stay hidden.

01:22:20.065 --> 01:22:21.483
Mom, please don't move.

01:22:21.567 --> 01:22:23.318
I don't think that's an option.

01:22:52.723 --> 01:22:53.932
- Shit.
- Mom!

01:23:11.491 --> 01:23:13.327
Little Prince!

01:24:29.069 --> 01:24:30.195
Fu--

01:24:30.279 --> 01:24:31.321
Nice.

01:24:34.658 --> 01:24:35.659
No.

01:24:35.742 --> 01:24:37.578
It's the guy from last night.

01:24:37.661 --> 01:24:38.787
Mom, we've got company.

01:24:38.871 --> 01:24:39.955
I'm coming.

01:24:44.710 --> 01:24:47.421
God! I got a little cocky there.

01:24:49.089 --> 01:24:50.674
Are you almost done? Can you hurry up?

01:24:50.757 --> 01:24:52.092
I'm working on it.

01:24:52.176 --> 01:24:54.428
Crap, the battery's dead. Kyle, please.
Can you do it a little faster?

01:24:54.511 --> 01:24:55.846
The car's not working.

01:24:58.932 --> 01:24:59.933
Hurry, Kyle.

01:25:00.767 --> 01:25:01.852
Shit.

01:25:03.145 --> 01:25:04.188
He's getting closer.

01:25:04.771 --> 01:25:06.732
I'm going as fast as I can.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.779
Are you done?

01:25:12.863 --> 01:25:14.489
- I hope so.
- Okay, let's go.

01:25:14.573 --> 01:25:15.657
Okay, move.

01:25:15.741 --> 01:25:17.034
Max, come on. Let's go.

01:25:17.117 --> 01:25:20.245
- How will Mommy find us?
- It's okay, Max. Mom's okay.

01:25:21.330 --> 01:25:22.706
- Here, give him to me.
- Take Max.

01:25:24.041 --> 01:25:25.626
He's an oil company enforcer!

01:25:31.215 --> 01:25:32.382
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:25:46.855 --> 01:25:48.106
Okay.

01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:49.942
Nina, Kyle, where are you?

01:25:53.737 --> 01:25:55.531
Where… Okay.

01:25:57.533 --> 01:25:59.785
Nina, Kyle, where are you?

01:26:03.205 --> 01:26:04.414
Nina?

01:26:11.088 --> 01:26:12.923
Okay, okay.

01:26:14.758 --> 01:26:15.926
Sorry.

01:26:16.009 --> 01:26:17.594
Mom.

01:26:20.681 --> 01:26:21.932
Let's go there. Come on.

01:26:25.143 --> 01:26:27.437
Max, get in the carousel, okay?

01:26:27.521 --> 01:26:29.106
All right. Let's go, Max. Let's go.

01:26:32.025 --> 01:26:33.235
Shit.

01:27:04.433 --> 01:27:05.851
You blew it, Danny Boy.

01:27:07.936 --> 01:27:10.105
All that training, and I still beat you.

01:27:24.161 --> 01:27:25.370
No, no.

01:27:27.206 --> 01:27:28.207
No.

01:27:29.583 --> 01:27:30.667
No.

01:27:33.504 --> 01:27:36.173
No, no, no, no. No, no, no!

01:27:44.389 --> 01:27:45.390
What's the matter, Finny?

01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:48.560
Not bad
for a couple pimple-faced brats, huh?

01:27:57.110 --> 01:28:00.739
I'm gonna kill you and those bloody kids!

01:28:01.532 --> 01:28:03.283
- Where are ya?
- Right here.

01:28:21.218 --> 01:28:22.219
Shit.

01:28:24.596 --> 01:28:26.473
You want a brother to play with?

01:28:26.557 --> 01:28:27.808
Let it go, Finn.

01:28:27.891 --> 01:28:29.309
Dad's empire's gone.

01:28:29.393 --> 01:28:30.769
There's nothing left to win.

01:28:30.853 --> 01:28:33.939
- Let it go!
- Well, let's play, Little Prince.

01:29:36.251 --> 01:29:37.628
Mommy!

01:29:39.004 --> 01:29:40.088
Oh, my God.

01:29:44.426 --> 01:29:46.762
Okay. Come on, you guys.

01:29:46.845 --> 01:29:48.639
Go, go. Police! Help!

01:29:49.473 --> 01:29:50.807
They can't hear us.

01:29:53.393 --> 01:29:54.478
Okay.

01:29:55.145 --> 01:29:56.355
Goodbye, children

01:29:57.231 --> 01:29:58.524
Hey, Mom.

01:30:03.987 --> 01:30:06.573
Hey! We're the bank robbers
wanted in England,

01:30:06.657 --> 01:30:07.908
but we really need your help.

01:30:15.123 --> 01:30:17.584
Nice little game
of hide-and-seek, Brother.

01:30:23.006 --> 01:30:24.258
You know, Sean,

01:30:25.634 --> 01:30:26.802
I'm interested.

01:30:28.095 --> 01:30:30.264
Are you enjoying your family vacation?

01:30:31.932 --> 01:30:34.434
You know, if you'd have
come to me as a brother,

01:30:35.435 --> 01:30:37.271
you could have been a part of that family.

01:30:37.354 --> 01:30:39.523
Instead, you try to kill them.

01:30:41.608 --> 01:30:42.901
No, Sean.

01:30:42.985 --> 01:30:44.820
I'm trying to kill you.

01:30:46.154 --> 01:30:48.156
You thought you'd won, didn't you?

01:30:49.449 --> 01:30:50.826
But you see, Sean,

01:30:51.785 --> 01:30:53.453
I don't need Dad's empire.

01:30:54.371 --> 01:30:56.999
I rose from nothing once.
I'll do it again.

01:30:59.418 --> 01:31:02.004
And you'll still have nothing
in your life that matters.

01:31:04.798 --> 01:31:06.008
Well, then maybe

01:31:06.717 --> 01:31:08.802
I'll look up
a recently widowed track coach.

01:31:35.913 --> 01:31:37.956
Give it up, Sean. You'll never win!

01:31:38.582 --> 01:31:40.876
I'm the only one who has
something left to fight for.

01:31:40.959 --> 01:31:43.253
You got nothing, Finn. Nothing.

01:31:52.888 --> 01:31:54.139
And what have you got?

01:31:54.932 --> 01:31:58.769
Your precious, boring family.

01:31:58.852 --> 01:31:59.937
That's right.

01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:03.690
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to
enjoy the rest of my family vacation.

01:33:07.045 --> 01:33:09.756
I told you it doesn't matter
where we are for Christmas.

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.258
Hi, Daddy.

01:33:21.268 --> 01:33:23.437
Operation Morgan Family Christmas is a go.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:26.773
All right, I don't care where we are,
as long as we are together as a family.

01:33:26.857 --> 01:33:27.941
I love you guys so much.

01:33:28.025 --> 01:33:29.318
- Love you.
- Merry Christmas.

01:33:29.401 --> 01:33:30.694
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:33:30.777 --> 01:33:32.946
You know that money that disappeared
from Grandpa's accounts?

01:33:35.616 --> 01:33:37.618
I had it transferred to Greenpeace.

01:33:37.701 --> 01:33:38.702
What?

01:33:38.785 --> 01:33:40.037
- Really?
- Merry Christmas.

01:33:40.704 --> 01:33:42.039
Merry Christmas.

01:33:42.122 --> 01:33:43.123
You're welcome.

01:34:08.398 --> 01:34:11.235
- This is them?
- Oui, Papa. That's them.

01:34:11.318 --> 01:34:12.444
Omar!

01:34:14.905 --> 01:34:17.324
Okay, okay. I'm happy to see him too.
That's enough.

01:34:17.908 --> 01:34:19.034
That's enough.

01:34:19.117 --> 01:34:20.536
You guys, this is my dad.

01:34:21.161 --> 01:34:23.080
He's the Secretary General of Interpol.

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:27.209
Excuse me, could you
maybe have mentioned that?

01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:29.127
No, I tried many times.

01:34:30.462 --> 01:34:32.214
But you were right about calling him.

01:34:32.297 --> 01:34:33.715
We spoke about everything.

01:34:34.341 --> 01:34:36.176
We settled our differences, so…

01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:37.261
Yeah.

01:34:37.344 --> 01:34:39.596
You know, you should be
so proud of your son, sir.

01:34:40.305 --> 01:34:41.723
- I'm Dan Morgan.
- Nice to meet you.

01:34:41.807 --> 01:34:44.351
This is my daughter, Nina,
and that's my son, Kyle.

01:34:44.434 --> 01:34:45.686
You should know they just took down

01:34:45.769 --> 01:34:47.938
one of the most dangerous
criminal networks in the world.

01:34:48.021 --> 01:34:50.190
- That's my wife, Jessica.
- Hi. Hi.

01:34:51.149 --> 01:34:53.151
Soon to be Head of Women's Track
at Ohio State.

01:34:56.154 --> 01:34:58.448
- Ohio State?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:34:59.032 --> 01:35:00.742
- That's incredible.
- Oh, my gosh!

01:35:00.826 --> 01:35:02.578
You deserve a big job like that.

01:35:02.661 --> 01:35:04.580
That's incredible. Why didn't you tell me?

01:35:04.663 --> 01:35:06.748
What? Oh, my God. I'm so proud of you.

01:35:06.832 --> 01:35:08.584
Wait. That's our youngest, Max.

01:35:08.667 --> 01:35:10.419
- What happened to Max?
- Wait.

01:35:10.502 --> 01:35:11.962
Where's… Maxie!

01:35:12.045 --> 01:35:13.630
That… No, that's not…

01:35:13.714 --> 01:35:15.507
- Is this your son?
- Ho ho ho.

01:35:15.591 --> 01:35:16.967
No, no, no, Max. That's not…

01:35:17.050 --> 01:35:18.552
Oh, no. Let him have it, Daddy.

01:35:19.136 --> 01:35:20.137
Let him have it.

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:22.639
- Oh, my gosh.
- Happy Christmas, Santa.

01:35:22.723 --> 01:35:24.600
Hey, let's keep an eye on your brother.

01:35:33.108 --> 01:35:36.111
I'm glad things are good there,
and you should be having fun,

01:35:36.195 --> 01:35:40.908
but you have to find and maintain
a balance between studying and partying.

01:35:40.991 --> 01:35:43.118
And things are good here.
You don't have to worry, all right?

01:35:43.202 --> 01:35:46.205
But I do have to say,
it's hard being so far away from you.

01:35:46.288 --> 01:35:48.207
I mean, I feel like
part of the family is missing.

01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:51.043
I feel the same. I miss you so much.

01:35:51.126 --> 01:35:52.127
Right?

01:35:52.211 --> 01:35:53.504
Sorry you're not here for Thanksgiving,

01:35:53.587 --> 01:35:55.005
but we're excited
to see you for Christmas.

01:35:55.088 --> 01:35:57.132
- I gotta go.
- Okay. See you later, Daddy.

01:36:03.305 --> 01:36:05.098
Any minute now.

01:36:13.774 --> 01:36:16.443
Hey, that move was awesome.
But what was our deal?

01:36:16.527 --> 01:36:18.237
Only when an adult is watching.

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.489
That's right.
Only one problem with that move.

01:36:20.572 --> 01:36:23.075
- What?
- Now you're defenseless and I got you.

01:36:24.785 --> 01:36:27.120
- You're getting big.
- You're getting old.

01:36:27.204 --> 01:36:28.247
They're here!

01:36:33.252 --> 01:36:35.879
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Welcome home, Beans.

01:36:36.630 --> 01:36:38.966
- This is amazing. This house is great.
- Kyle.

01:36:39.049 --> 01:36:40.634
- Hey! Max.
- It's beautiful, right?

01:36:41.802 --> 01:36:44.179
- Hi.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:36:44.263 --> 01:36:46.431
Hey. Put her there, college man.

01:36:46.515 --> 01:36:47.766
Get outta here.

01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:49.518
- Welcome home, Nina.
- Look at you.

01:36:50.102 --> 01:36:51.770
Wow. How does it feel
to be there out on your own?

01:36:51.854 --> 01:36:55.315
You know, it's nice, Dad.
I love it, but it's good to be home.

01:36:55.399 --> 01:36:57.526
- Hey, we're always here, buddy.
- Kyle, have you done

01:36:57.609 --> 01:36:59.111
any laundry since September?

01:36:59.194 --> 01:37:00.779
There's a laundry?

01:37:00.863 --> 01:37:03.532
Hey. We're always here, pal,
but not to do your laundry.

01:37:03.615 --> 01:37:04.950
My God.

01:37:05.033 --> 01:37:07.452
- Don't you have practice soon?
- No, I let them go early

01:37:07.536 --> 01:37:08.954
for Thanksgiving, so I'm all yours.

01:37:09.037 --> 01:37:10.330
Third date all mine?

01:37:10.414 --> 01:37:12.165
- Yes.
- Wow. All right.

01:37:12.791 --> 01:37:14.710
- We'll have the adults watch the kid.
- No.

01:37:14.793 --> 01:37:16.879
- That's a wonderful idea.
- Just keep an eye on your brother.

01:37:16.962 --> 01:37:19.214
You gotta check out the new swing set.
Watch your brother.

01:37:46.074 --> 01:37:47.284
You.

01:37:51.246 --> 01:37:52.331
Merry Christmas, Finn.

01:37:53.916 --> 01:37:55.083
I brought you something.

01:37:58.504 --> 01:38:00.255
Is that supposed to be funny?

01:38:01.757 --> 01:38:02.841
You gonna open it?

01:38:06.678 --> 01:38:07.888
Can I open this?

01:38:07.971 --> 01:38:09.264
Of course, Mr McCaffrey

01:38:09.765 --> 01:38:12.100
Mr. McCaffrey, huh?
You're running the joint?

01:38:14.102 --> 01:38:15.938
Little respect makes you comfy.

01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:27.741
I hope it fits.

01:38:33.872 --> 01:38:34.957
Come on, try it on.

01:38:44.216 --> 01:38:45.467
It looks good on you.

01:38:47.719 --> 01:38:49.346
We look like real twats.

01:38:49.429 --> 01:38:50.597
We're brothers.

01:38:53.684 --> 01:38:55.519
So, what now?

01:39:00.399 --> 01:39:01.441
We play.

01:39:08.615 --> 01:39:09.741
You better not cheat.

01:39:10.659 --> 01:39:11.827
Of course I'm gonna cheat.

01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:14.705
- I mean, look who raised me.
- Yeah, and I'll still beat you.

01:39:14.788 --> 01:39:16.039
Yeah?

01:39:16.123 --> 01:39:17.958
What, like you beat me in Paris?
