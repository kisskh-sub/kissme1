Madam Lin,
all the brothers have arrived.

00:01:17.687 --> 00:01:19.511
I'm worried that even
if we hand over the ledger,

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.752
Song Zhichu still won't let Lin Yun go.

00:01:21.872 --> 00:01:24.031
Take the brothers and wait
at the police station entrance.

00:01:24.032 --> 00:01:25.874
If you don't see Lin Yun
and me come out,

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:28.431
then bring the brothers and storm in.

00:01:28.432 --> 00:01:31.952
No matter what,
we must bring Lin Yun back today.

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:33.991
Madam Lin.

00:01:33.992 --> 00:01:36.031
Are you really ready to give up
the ledger for the boss?

00:01:36.032 --> 00:01:39.912
Right now, nothing is more important
than Lin Yun's life.

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:41.186
Brothers!

00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:42.495
Yes!

00:01:43.287 --> 00:01:44.407
Let's go.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.009
What wind blew Madam Lin here today?

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.449
I brought the ledger.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.810
Release Lin Yun.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:10.642
No rush.

00:02:11.175 --> 00:02:13.215
This year's new tea. Have a taste.

00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:25.952
Cut the nonsense. Where is Lin Yun?

00:02:29.762 --> 00:02:31.922
With a temper like yours,

00:02:35.472 --> 00:02:37.311
how did you survive in Huaying Brothel?

00:02:37.312 --> 00:02:38.912
None of your business.

00:02:39.337 --> 00:02:40.724
I'll take the ledger.

00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:42.405
But if you want me to release Lin Yun,

00:02:43.192 --> 00:02:44.551
impossible.

00:02:44.552 --> 00:02:45.992
Stop dreaming.

00:02:46.062 --> 00:02:47.471
Despicable rat.

00:02:47.472 --> 00:02:49.072
I was right about you.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.950
Ungrateful woman.

00:02:52.992 --> 00:02:55.432
Believe it or not,
I can take your life right now.

00:02:56.312 --> 00:02:57.151
Didn't expect

00:02:57.152 --> 00:03:00.472
Chief Song to be a mad dog
that only barks at women.

00:03:01.112 --> 00:03:03.631
For Lin Yun, you're not even
afraid of death.

00:03:03.632 --> 00:03:05.631
Outside, a whole group
of Chengyun Society aren't afraid either.

00:03:05.632 --> 00:03:06.952
Why should I be?

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:10.511
You, a lowly woman from Huaying Brothel,

00:03:10.512 --> 00:03:12.031
really think you're a boss's wife?

00:03:12.032 --> 00:03:15.351
Still better than a coward
hiding behind his father.

00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:17.751
If you insist on not releasing Lin Yun,

00:03:17.752 --> 00:03:19.191
then we'll fight to the death.

00:03:19.192 --> 00:03:21.632
Fight to the death, is it?

00:03:21.837 --> 00:03:24.557
With those Chengyun Society scumbags?

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:27.665
I can wipe out Chengyun Society today,
so what?

00:03:31.072 --> 00:03:31.911
Young master.

00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:34.992
Master is furious.
He wants you immediately.

00:03:35.912 --> 00:03:37.082
I'll deal with you later.

00:03:38.425 --> 00:03:39.385
Coming.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:54.152
Father.

00:03:54.472 --> 00:03:56.272
Take off your dogskin.

00:03:56.792 --> 00:03:57.686
Kneel.

00:03:57.687 --> 00:03:58.607
Father!

00:03:58.752 --> 00:03:59.872
What?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.760
My words don't matter anymore?

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:25.394
How did I warn you previously?

00:04:25.395 --> 00:04:29.035
You must not let the opium matter
blow up.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.350
Commander Jin already called.

00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:38.271
At this critical moment of the election,

00:04:38.272 --> 00:04:40.551
everyone knows you're dealing opium.

00:04:40.552 --> 00:04:41.871
If this isn't handled well,

00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:44.631
my bid for provincial chairman
is finished.

00:04:44.632 --> 00:04:49.370
If not for Lin Yun scheming against me,
how would the opium trade be exposed?

00:04:51.672 --> 00:04:53.392
Look at your pathetic self.

00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:56.485
Do you look anything like my son?

00:05:04.632 --> 00:05:06.391
I've planned for so long

00:05:06.392 --> 00:05:08.471
all for the governor's seat.

00:05:08.472 --> 00:05:10.751
But now the whole city is in chaos.

00:05:10.752 --> 00:05:13.792
And you can't even handle someone
as insignificant as Lin Yun.

00:05:14.192 --> 00:05:17.112
What can I count on you for
in the future?

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.360
Do you admit you were wrong?

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:22.127
Were you wrong?

00:05:24.952 --> 00:05:27.591
Release Lin Yun immediately.

00:05:27.592 --> 00:05:29.831
Haven't you thought about it?

00:05:29.832 --> 00:05:32.471
If he didn't have something up
his sleeve,

00:05:32.472 --> 00:05:35.474
would he have been caught so easily?

00:05:35.475 --> 00:05:36.475
Idiot.

00:05:47.075 --> 00:05:49.561
Bring that mangy dog up here.

00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:50.642
Lin Yun.

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:56.832
You shouldn't have traded
the ledger for me.

00:05:57.762 --> 00:05:59.002
Song Zhichu.

00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:01.424
Today's events,

00:06:01.425 --> 00:06:03.425
I, Lin Yun, will remember.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.520
Get lost now.

00:06:14.912 --> 00:06:18.192
(Lin Yun, just you wait.)

00:06:26.392 --> 00:06:29.152
Song Zhichu didn't let you go
because of the ledger, right?

00:06:30.712 --> 00:06:34.112
You brought all the brothers
and surrounded the police station.

00:06:35.352 --> 00:06:36.231
Would Song Zhichu

00:06:36.232 --> 00:06:38.591
dare refuse to let me go?

00:06:38.592 --> 00:06:40.951
You traded the ledger for me,
do you not regret it?

00:06:40.952 --> 00:06:42.432
No, I don't.

00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:48.432
You hate Song Zhichu that much?

00:06:48.832 --> 00:06:49.952
I do.

00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:52.800
I've thought it through.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.351
A single ledger won't be enough
to bring Song Zhichu down.

00:06:55.352 --> 00:06:57.271
But it can make you owe me a huge favor.

00:06:57.272 --> 00:06:58.832
So I'm not losing anything.

you gave me come from?

00:08:02.032 --> 00:08:04.351
Thanks to that ledger Liang Yi found.

00:08:04.352 --> 00:08:06.511
It proves everything I suspected
was right.

00:08:06.512 --> 00:08:08.791
All these years, Song Ming has been
using Rong City's money

00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:10.792
to buy guns from Yunzhou.

00:08:11.987 --> 00:08:13.666
Song Ming should be contacting us soon.

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:14.824
He already has.

00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:16.225
He wants to meet you tomorrow night.

00:08:16.512 --> 00:08:19.071
After playing games with Song Zhichu
for so many years,

00:08:19.072 --> 00:08:20.911
it's finally Song Ming's turn.

Boss, for your sake,

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.680
Madam Lin even gave up the ledger
that could've taken Song Zhichu down.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.031
Are you really planning
not to tell her anything?

00:08:27.032 --> 00:08:28.152
You don't understand.

00:08:29.862 --> 00:08:31.924
I absolutely cannot let her

00:08:31.925 --> 00:08:33.805
risk her life for me ever again.

00:08:34.462 --> 00:08:35.421
Fine, fine.

00:08:35.422 --> 00:08:37.622
I don't understand, only you understand.

00:08:42.392 --> 00:08:44.312
Boss, he's here.

00:08:44.952 --> 00:08:46.192
He came early.

00:08:46.832 --> 00:08:49.872
Looks like he's very interested
in his gift.

00:08:55.832 --> 00:08:57.591
My dear nephew, long time no see.

00:08:57.592 --> 00:08:59.112
Come, sit.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.799
Zhichu is young and impulsive.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.111
He acts recklessly.

00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:13.352
I apologize on his behalf.

00:09:14.112 --> 00:09:15.311
No need.

00:09:15.312 --> 00:09:17.071
The one who offended me was Song Zhichu,

00:09:17.072 --> 00:09:18.711
not you, Mayor Song.

00:09:18.712 --> 00:09:20.911
Zhichu is still my son.

00:09:20.912 --> 00:09:22.872
It's my fault for not
controlling him well.

00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:26.952
Mayor Song, you truly dote on your son.

00:09:28.792 --> 00:09:30.471
There's nothing I can do.

00:09:30.472 --> 00:09:33.232
Parents all over the world are the same.

00:09:37.712 --> 00:09:39.871
I heard that opium den

00:09:39.872 --> 00:09:41.392
was shut down by you?

00:09:43.072 --> 00:09:44.192
That's right.

00:09:44.592 --> 00:09:46.791
I just hope you

00:09:46.792 --> 00:09:48.911
won't blame me for meddling, Mayor Song.

00:09:48.912 --> 00:09:50.392
Not at all.

00:09:50.712 --> 00:09:52.712
Rong City has banned opium
for so many years.

00:09:52.872 --> 00:09:56.631
Yet someone still dared to sell it
on the black market.

00:09:56.632 --> 00:09:58.991
You've saved the entire city.

00:09:58.992 --> 00:10:00.792
How could I blame you?

00:10:03.872 --> 00:10:04.992
Good.

00:10:10.512 --> 00:10:11.632
By the way.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.271
The documents you gave me earlier

00:10:14.272 --> 00:10:16.432
are not full set, right?

00:10:20.792 --> 00:10:22.311
Everything on here records

00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:24.992
the scandals of every candidate
except you.

00:10:25.075 --> 00:10:27.520
(The Chen family repaid
all their bank loans on time.)

00:10:27.992 --> 00:10:29.791
I believe with this information,

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:33.552
the position of provincial chairman
is yours.

00:10:39.312 --> 00:10:40.924
You're very thoughtful.

00:10:40.925 --> 00:10:42.805
But,

00:10:42.952 --> 00:10:46.832
did you really give me
all the candidates' scandals?

00:10:53.992 --> 00:10:55.112
Come in.

00:10:56.912 --> 00:10:57.912
Boss.

00:11:14.032 --> 00:11:15.471
My subordinate made a mistake.

00:11:15.472 --> 00:11:16.991
I checked just now and found

00:11:16.992 --> 00:11:18.632
there was still a falsified document.

00:11:20.912 --> 00:11:22.591
(Opium Transport Contract)
If you don't mind,

00:11:22.592 --> 00:11:24.440
(Party A: Song Ming; Party B: Li Transport Bureau)
I'll destroy it right away.

00:11:24.632 --> 00:11:26.831
If it's fake,

00:11:26.832 --> 00:11:28.752
then destroy it.

00:11:29.575 --> 00:11:31.582
(Opium Transport Contract)

00:11:46.112 --> 00:11:47.511
I'm in a good mood today.

00:11:47.512 --> 00:11:50.032
Come, let's drink another round.

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:56.351
You're about the same age as Zhichu,

00:11:56.352 --> 00:12:00.192
but you're far more steady than he is.

00:12:05.592 --> 00:12:07.711
Mayor Song, you flatter me.

00:12:07.712 --> 00:12:09.431
After all, I'm not like Song Zhichu

00:12:09.432 --> 00:12:12.552
who has such an impressive father.

00:12:15.152 --> 00:12:17.032
I have high hopes for you.

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:34.911
Boss.

00:12:34.912 --> 00:12:37.671
That kick of yours was brutal.

00:12:37.672 --> 00:12:39.711
And Song Ming, what a good actor.

00:12:39.712 --> 00:12:42.231
He pretended as if he really
didn't know about the opium.

00:12:42.232 --> 00:12:44.112
If he wants to be provincial chairman,

00:12:45.152 --> 00:12:49.192
then he must pretend he knows
nothing about it.

00:12:49.472 --> 00:12:50.680
He's really ruthless.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.360
By doing this, isn't he clearly
making it so that if anything happens,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.952
Song Zhichu will take the fall for him?

00:12:56.272 --> 00:12:58.992
Your father is really something else.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.370
He's not my father.

00:13:05.025 --> 00:13:07.505
I'll never acknowledge him,
not even in death.
