00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:23.772
Thank you for the ride home.

00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:26.692
Why do you have so many bags?

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:28.068
They're just my stuff.

00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:30.154
Drive home safely, Mr. Lee.

00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:31.906
Okay.

00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:34.992
Thank goodness it's the weekend tomorrow.

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:35.910
Right?

00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:41.832
-Are you kidding me?
-Sleep well.

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:44.209
And sleep in tomorrow.

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:47.296
Seriously?

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:48.213
Hey, it's Kang Pil-gu!

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.727
Hey, go ask him.

00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:04.939
Excuse me.

00:02:05.022 --> 00:02:06.398
Are you Kang Pil-gu?

00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:07.566
Holy cow, it is!

00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:15.366
Should we go home and watch Kang Pil-gu?

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:17.660
Yeah, let's rewatch the first season.

00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:20.955
-Season one is boring.
-Season four is the best.

00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:21.956
No, season two is good.

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.376
Let's watch season one
and go back to where it all began.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.919
But season two is more fun.

00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:28.212
You should head home now.

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:30.589
Okay. I'll get going, then.

00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:38.764
-That's boring.
-No, it's not.

00:02:39.348 --> 00:02:40.474
Are they gone?

00:02:40.557 --> 00:02:41.684
Yes, they're gone.

00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:51.902
"His clothes are caked with dirt
as he stares coldly at the gang members."

00:02:51.986 --> 00:02:52.987
Jeong-sin, are you home?

00:02:55.114 --> 00:02:57.574
Jeong-sin, I went to the set today
to introduce myself.

00:02:57.658 --> 00:02:58.742
And guess what happened?

00:02:59.326 --> 00:03:02.413
My bro Pil-gu said hello to me first!

00:03:02.496 --> 00:03:03.539
Really?

00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:05.541
-Give it your all, you punk.
-Of course.

00:03:05.624 --> 00:03:08.377
Hey, what about the gimbap?
Did you eat it? It was good, right?

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.420
Yeah, it was.

00:03:10.212 --> 00:03:11.797
I really enjoyed it.

00:03:12.464 --> 00:03:13.799
Jeez.

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:26.603
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:03:26.687 --> 00:03:27.521
-Go Kang Pil-gu!
-Go Kang Pil-gu!

00:03:27.604 --> 00:03:29.690
-Here.
-Oh, thank you.

00:03:49.543 --> 00:03:52.546
Forget about that guy already
and come to me.

00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:55.799
And I'm still waiting for you.

00:04:11.774 --> 00:04:14.193
CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO

00:04:14.276 --> 00:04:16.487
PRESIDENT LEE JAE-HYEONG

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.431
It's not like it'll contain state secrets.

00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:47.976
Let's see here.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.943
Gosh.

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.071
How old was she in these pictures?

00:04:59.154 --> 00:05:00.906
She's so adorable.

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:02.157
Goodness.

00:05:04.493 --> 00:05:06.245
How cute.

00:05:06.954 --> 00:05:08.330
She's wearing her best dress.

00:05:09.123 --> 00:05:10.791
WI JEONG-SIN

00:05:16.547 --> 00:05:18.882
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes, I'm listening.

00:05:18.966 --> 00:05:20.759
There's this woman I know.

00:05:21.885 --> 00:05:24.805
And I saw her with another man.

00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:26.890
But…

00:05:27.766 --> 00:05:30.435
why does that bother me so much?

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:34.231
Feeling angry in a situation like that
is a perfectly natural reaction.

00:05:34.314 --> 00:05:36.483
However, it's important
to keep your emotions in check

00:05:36.567 --> 00:05:38.652
and deal with it wisely.

00:05:38.735 --> 00:05:40.863
You always make
pointless remarks like that.

00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:43.949
First, take a deep breath
and calm your mind…

00:05:44.032 --> 00:05:45.159
I'm done listening to you today.

00:05:50.497 --> 00:05:53.667
Darn it, why am I on this app again?

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.877
SOULISHERE

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.839
"If it'll help even a little,
I'd like to remain friends."

00:05:58.922 --> 00:06:00.174
Goodness!

00:06:00.257 --> 00:06:01.884
Don't you have any pride?

00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:03.886
You have no problem
throwing insults at me!

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.679
Darn it.

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:36.376
What the heck?

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.296
He was the one who messaged me first.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.298
Why isn't he replying now?

00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:01.568
Onion!

00:07:11.036 --> 00:07:13.080
I hope I didn't pressure you again.

00:07:13.163 --> 00:07:14.665
Please reach out

00:07:15.332 --> 00:07:16.208
whenever you feel ready.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.928
EPISODE 10

00:08:02.504 --> 00:08:03.338
What's this?

00:08:03.422 --> 00:08:05.382
You know it's your jacket, Mr. Lee.

00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:07.384
The one I got for your birthday.

00:08:11.096 --> 00:08:12.055
Have you forgotten?

00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:16.768
I guess so.

00:08:16.852 --> 00:08:18.854
I forgot for a moment where it was from.

00:08:21.398 --> 00:08:23.567
-Wi Jeong-sin likes someone.
-I know.

00:08:24.526 --> 00:08:26.611
But there shouldn't be a problem
unless the feeling's mutual.

00:08:27.195 --> 00:08:29.614
I guess I forgot for a moment too.

00:08:29.698 --> 00:08:32.242
That you're like a dandelion,
stubborn and impossible to tame.

00:08:46.923 --> 00:08:47.883
Hello.

00:08:47.966 --> 00:08:49.468
I returned the jacket to Mr. Lee.

00:09:00.228 --> 00:09:01.229
You have something to say?

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.733
I'm sorry, but can you send
someone else to cover Kang Pil-gu?

00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:05.650
Why?

00:09:05.734 --> 00:09:07.903
He's giving you an exclusive
on a silver platter.

00:09:08.487 --> 00:09:09.988
-It makes me uncomfortable.
-What does?

00:09:10.072 --> 00:09:11.615
-You mean, Lim Hyeon-jun?
-Yes.

00:09:12.908 --> 00:09:14.951
Since when did reporters
get to choose easy coverages?

00:09:15.494 --> 00:09:17.454
Did you leave your tenacity at the door
when you came here?

00:09:19.581 --> 00:09:21.625
The truth is, I'm a fan of Kang Pil-gu.

00:09:22.209 --> 00:09:23.752
Right, a fan… Wait, what?

00:09:23.835 --> 00:09:26.588
Surgeons aren't allowed
to operate on those close to them,

00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:28.965
and judges can file a motion for recusal
if a conflict of interest

00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:30.592
prevents them from being impartial.

00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:32.928
My situation is no different,
so I'm filing a motion for recusal.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.975
-You're all done now.
-Thank you so much.

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:41.603
Mr. Lim, we'll head out to the set first.

00:09:41.686 --> 00:09:43.021
-Okay.
-We'll see you soon.

00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:47.734
I hope I didn't pressure you again.

00:09:47.818 --> 00:09:49.569
Please reach out

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.154
whenever you feel ready.

00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:54.658
If you don't want to go in circles,

00:09:54.741 --> 00:09:57.953
maybe it's time to choose a path
and stick with it.

00:09:58.036 --> 00:10:00.038
It seems you've
already made up your mind anyway.

00:10:04.376 --> 00:10:06.128
Right. Okay, good.

00:10:10.298 --> 00:10:11.508
SETTINGS

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.348
DELETE ACCOUNT

00:10:18.432 --> 00:10:20.600
YOUR ACTIVITY WILL BE DELETED PERMANENTLY
"YES"

00:10:20.684 --> 00:10:21.893
YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN DELETED

00:10:25.897 --> 00:10:27.065
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yeah?

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.568
When is Ms. Wi arriving?

00:10:29.651 --> 00:10:32.112
I don't know. Maybe around 2 o'clock?

00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:33.697
Yeah, at 2 o'clock.

00:10:35.198 --> 00:10:36.408
Mr. Lim, it's time.

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:38.285
-All right.
-Got it.

00:10:39.619 --> 00:10:40.454
Let's go.

00:10:42.873 --> 00:10:44.082
-Bro, have some coffee.
-What?

00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:45.750
Oh, thanks.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.961
Is Ms. Wi not coming?

00:10:48.044 --> 00:10:49.129
She's coming at 2 o'clock.

00:10:49.212 --> 00:10:50.672
Right, 2 o'clock.

00:10:51.798 --> 00:10:53.675
Jeez, my lower back.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:55.844
When is Ms. Wi coming?

00:10:56.428 --> 00:10:58.805
At 2 o'clock. I already told you!

00:11:01.057 --> 00:11:02.058
You did?

00:11:04.478 --> 00:11:05.604
-Lunch is here.
-Okay.

00:11:06.438 --> 00:11:07.314
Come eat.

00:11:07.397 --> 00:11:09.566
Go ahead and eat.

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:11.693
-Why?
-I'll eat with Ms. Wi when she comes.

00:11:12.527 --> 00:11:13.361
Forget him. Let's eat.

00:11:13.945 --> 00:11:15.697
Maybe you should give Ms. Wi a call.

00:11:16.198 --> 00:11:17.949
She might have taken a wrong turn.

00:11:18.533 --> 00:11:19.576
Give her a call, will you?

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.996
-Ms. Wi?
-I'm so sick of this.

00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:28.126
-Have you had lunch?
-Yes, I have.

00:11:30.504 --> 00:11:32.339
We can't take this out.

00:11:32.923 --> 00:11:34.007
They've got to understand.

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:35.884
-Bro, where are you going?
-Huh?

00:11:35.967 --> 00:11:37.093
Where are you going?

00:11:37.177 --> 00:11:39.679
-Is Ms. Wi not coming?
-What's wrong with your ears?

00:11:39.763 --> 00:11:40.889
I told you 2 o'clock!

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:42.516
At 2 o'clock.

00:11:42.599 --> 00:11:43.433
It's not 2 o'clock yet?

00:11:44.017 --> 00:11:46.895
If it were, she'd be here by now.
She's not here because it's not time yet.

00:11:46.978 --> 00:11:49.606
I'm just asking
because reporters usually arrive early.

00:11:51.983 --> 00:11:53.568
What's wrong with you, bro?

00:11:54.444 --> 00:11:55.987
Hey, do I look better buttoned up?

00:11:57.864 --> 00:12:00.534
-Just cover yourself up like this.
-No?

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.961
Yes, sir.

00:12:11.628 --> 00:12:12.754
Oh, really?

00:12:12.837 --> 00:12:14.881
Thank you for letting me know.

00:12:14.965 --> 00:12:15.924
-Bro, 2 o'clock is here.
-What?

00:12:16.007 --> 00:12:17.008
I mean, the reporter is here.

00:12:17.092 --> 00:12:19.970
-Right, okay!
-Mr. Lim, she's in the waiting room.

00:12:20.053 --> 00:12:22.055
Okay. Makeup team, touch up my hair!

00:12:22.138 --> 00:12:22.973
Let's go.

00:12:31.064 --> 00:12:33.066
What brings you here, Ms. Yun?

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.945
We thought Ms. Wi would be coming instead.

00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:39.114
I'm here to do some coverage.

00:12:39.197 --> 00:12:41.408
Does it really matter who shows up?

00:12:41.491 --> 00:12:42.993
You're right, of course.

00:12:43.076 --> 00:12:46.538
Is there a reason why Ms. Wi didn't come?

00:12:46.621 --> 00:12:47.789
Is she sick?

00:12:47.872 --> 00:12:50.292
She didn't get into an accident, did she?

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:53.336
There's no other reason
for Ms. Wi not to be here.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.213
She says she's a fan of yours.

00:12:55.964 --> 00:12:59.217
She didn't think it was right to let
personal feelings influence the coverage,

00:12:59.968 --> 00:13:01.094
so that's why I came instead.

00:13:05.682 --> 00:13:08.935
Ms. Wi told you she's a fan of mine?

00:13:09.477 --> 00:13:11.354
Yes, and she filed a motion for recusal.

00:13:12.647 --> 00:13:15.817
Wait, does that mean
you'll be coming here from now on?

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.278
That can't happen. It wouldn't be right.

00:13:18.361 --> 00:13:19.946
Is there a reason I can't be here?

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.906
No, that's not what I meant.

00:13:23.742 --> 00:13:24.659
Never mind.

00:13:25.952 --> 00:13:27.787
Do you have feelings for Ms. Wi?

00:13:28.496 --> 00:13:29.456
No!

00:13:30.415 --> 00:13:32.125
I mean…

00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:34.169
Oh, my back.

00:13:36.087 --> 00:13:38.173
Jeez, Ms. Yun.

00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:40.133
Don't laugh too hard.
You'll hurt your back again.

00:13:41.843 --> 00:13:44.763
You went too far with that joke, ma'am.

00:13:44.846 --> 00:13:46.264
Come on, Ms. Yun.

00:13:49.017 --> 00:13:50.268
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yes?

00:13:50.352 --> 00:13:52.729
Could I talk to Mr. Lim privately
before the interview?

00:13:52.812 --> 00:13:53.897
Yes, of course.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.322
Gosh, that was a close call.

00:14:03.156 --> 00:14:05.784
Man, that woman is really perceptive.

00:14:05.867 --> 00:14:07.160
LIM HYEON-JUN

00:14:07.243 --> 00:14:09.037
We totally fooled her, though.

00:14:20.423 --> 00:14:21.800
You like Wi Jeong-sin, don't you?

00:14:24.219 --> 00:14:25.220
Jeez.

00:14:26.888 --> 00:14:28.723
Why do you keep asking that?

00:14:29.766 --> 00:14:30.809
I told you that I don't.

00:14:33.353 --> 00:14:34.187
Is that so?

00:14:36.398 --> 00:14:39.943
Then I guess it wouldn't matter
if Ms. Wi and Mr. Lee started dating.

00:14:40.694 --> 00:14:41.611
Are they dating?

00:14:41.695 --> 00:14:43.947
It's only a matter of time
unless we stop them.

00:14:47.659 --> 00:14:50.286
Why are you telling me this anyway?

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:51.663
I want you to team up with me.

00:14:51.746 --> 00:14:53.248
I'll be honest with you.

00:14:53.331 --> 00:14:54.666
I like Mr. Lee.

00:14:58.712 --> 00:14:59.587
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:15:01.005 --> 00:15:01.923
So what do you say?

00:15:02.006 --> 00:15:03.216
Do you want to team up with me,

00:15:03.717 --> 00:15:05.385
or see Ms. Wi with another man?

00:15:16.229 --> 00:15:18.148
We're on the same team now.

00:15:21.484 --> 00:15:25.363
I'll do everything in my power
to send her to the set of Kang Pil-gu.

00:15:25.447 --> 00:15:28.408
So you do everything in your power
to win her over.

00:15:32.662 --> 00:15:33.496
I will.

00:15:37.584 --> 00:15:40.044
DEPT. OF JOURNALISM & BROADCASTING
17TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL CONTEST

00:15:40.128 --> 00:15:41.087
Wi Jeong-sin!

00:15:42.005 --> 00:15:42.839
Hey!

00:15:42.922 --> 00:15:45.884
So you're a professor now.
It suits you better than being a reporter.

00:15:47.469 --> 00:15:50.638
I think I'm better suited
to teaching students too.

00:15:52.557 --> 00:15:54.976
Anyway, the fact that you came
all the way here

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:56.936
means you have something to ask me.

00:15:58.104 --> 00:16:01.733
It's about Assemblyman Ha Gee-wan.

00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:04.152
Ha Gee-wan?

00:16:04.235 --> 00:16:06.237
At the Financial Supervisory Service?

00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:09.949
Is he familiar with Lee Dae-ho,
the chairman of Eunseongilbo?

00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:12.285
You probably didn't know
since you were new to the political desk,

00:16:12.911 --> 00:16:14.579
but there was a rumor at the time

00:16:15.121 --> 00:16:17.874
that Assemblyman Ha received land
from Lee Dae-ho under a borrowed name.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.001
You mean, in Cheongwon City?

00:16:20.084 --> 00:16:22.086
It was just a rumor back then,
and it still is.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.214
When the aide died,
there was no witness left.

00:16:26.341 --> 00:16:28.968
Do you know if the aide had any family
other than his wife?

00:16:29.052 --> 00:16:29.928
Why do you ask?

00:16:30.011 --> 00:16:32.055
They say money comes before family, right?

00:16:34.724 --> 00:16:37.185
I guess there may have been
a money-related issue

00:16:37.769 --> 00:16:40.188
in Mr. Woo Young-suk's family
that I wasn't aware of.

00:16:41.022 --> 00:16:43.316
I'm just speculating too.

00:16:45.443 --> 00:16:47.445
Thank you so much. I'll look into it.

00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:49.197
Wait.

00:16:50.114 --> 00:16:52.575
With that said, can I ask you a favor too?

00:16:53.952 --> 00:16:54.953
A favor?

00:16:56.996 --> 00:16:59.624
I can't believe
I'm finally meeting you, Ms. Seong.

00:16:59.707 --> 00:17:02.836
I used to watch your movies on repeat
when I was young.

00:17:05.713 --> 00:17:07.215
You must've been mature for your age.

00:17:09.384 --> 00:17:10.260
Well…

00:17:10.343 --> 00:17:12.804
The artistic value of Madam Walnut
and The Godmother

00:17:12.887 --> 00:17:16.933
was overshadowed by the nude scenes,
but they were both masterpieces.

00:17:17.517 --> 00:17:19.853
I heard Seon-u was playing
the younger Pil-gu.

00:17:19.936 --> 00:17:21.980
I know it's shameless of me to ask,

00:17:22.564 --> 00:17:24.607
but is there any role I could play too?

00:17:24.691 --> 00:17:25.525
Oh, right.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:27.944
I actually learned about that today.

00:17:28.027 --> 00:17:29.946
No wonder he looked
so similar to Hyeon-jun.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.739
I'm sorry, Director.

00:17:34.242 --> 00:17:36.786
Well, there is a role
for the wife of a rich family

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.413
where Pil-gu's aunt
works as a housekeeper.

00:17:38.496 --> 00:17:40.498
She gets into a fight
with her cheating husband

00:17:40.582 --> 00:17:42.292
and ends up killing him.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.255
Director, I know I can do this
if you give me a chance.

00:17:47.338 --> 00:17:49.465
I'm positive I can pull off the role!

00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:52.176
Of course, Ms. Seong.
I have no doubt about your acting skills.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.928
I look forward to working with you.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.326
This smells good.

00:18:25.001 --> 00:18:26.961
-I'll go to the set of Kang Pil-gu.
-You should go to the set of Kang Pil-gu.

00:18:28.588 --> 00:18:29.964
What changed your mind?

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.052
I couldn't bring myself

00:18:34.135 --> 00:18:36.804
to give away what was already in my hands.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.058
I'll do my best.

00:18:40.558 --> 00:18:41.392
Okay.

00:18:48.775 --> 00:18:49.901
Where's Mi-yeong?

00:18:50.735 --> 00:18:51.945
Where is she?

00:18:57.992 --> 00:18:59.452
What's the point of asking

00:19:00.161 --> 00:19:01.371
when you're about to die?

00:19:01.955 --> 00:19:02.789
Cut.

00:19:03.665 --> 00:19:05.917
Why are you acting
when I'm recording Mr. Lim?

00:19:06.501 --> 00:19:09.087
-What else am I supposed to do?
-It looks awkward.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.464
Mr. Lim's manager?
Can I see you for a moment?

00:19:12.256 --> 00:19:14.467
-When do we start shooting?
-Soon, sir.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.844
-Why did I get called in so early?
-I'm sorry, sir.

00:19:16.928 --> 00:19:18.513
There's probably a lot to set up.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.348
Oh, right.

00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:23.267
Bro, why did you call Ms. Wi over here?

00:19:23.351 --> 00:19:25.103
What if she runs into Director Bak?

00:19:27.438 --> 00:19:28.439
I'm not a fool.

00:19:29.023 --> 00:19:31.234
The second unit director
is in charge today.

00:19:32.986 --> 00:19:35.321
No wonder you seemed so relaxed.

00:19:37.824 --> 00:19:38.866
Cheers to that.

00:19:40.034 --> 00:19:41.411
Hello!

00:19:41.494 --> 00:19:43.329
-Hello.
-How are you?

00:19:43.413 --> 00:19:45.790
-Good morning!
-Hello!

00:19:45.873 --> 00:19:46.833
Hello.

00:19:47.667 --> 00:19:48.918
Mr. Lim, you're early.

00:19:50.253 --> 00:19:53.214
The second unit director is in today,
so what brings you here?

00:19:53.297 --> 00:19:55.842
Unfortunately, Director Oh caught the flu.

00:19:55.925 --> 00:19:57.218
-No!
-What? Why?

00:19:57.301 --> 00:19:58.970
Oh, never mind.

00:19:59.053 --> 00:20:01.055
He came down with the flu this morning,

00:20:01.139 --> 00:20:03.182
so I rushed over
before we could send out a notice.

00:20:04.517 --> 00:20:06.019
Hey, come here.

00:20:06.102 --> 00:20:06.936
What is it?

00:20:08.771 --> 00:20:12.025
How could you change
the schedule like that?

00:20:12.108 --> 00:20:14.402
We had plans, you know!

00:20:14.485 --> 00:20:17.947
You could've at least
covered up in a mask and gloves!

00:20:18.031 --> 00:20:19.115
-He's right!
-Come on.

00:20:20.158 --> 00:20:23.828
If I'd known Ms. Wi was coming today,
I would've… Damn it.

00:20:23.911 --> 00:20:25.288
No.

00:20:25.371 --> 00:20:26.414
This won't work.

00:20:26.497 --> 00:20:28.124
Cancel today's shoot right now.

00:20:28.207 --> 00:20:31.002
We should be canceling the interview,
not the shoot!

00:20:32.128 --> 00:20:32.962
Right.

00:20:33.546 --> 00:20:36.049
Hey, tell Ms. Wi not to come today.

00:20:36.132 --> 00:20:37.508
Okay, got it.

00:20:37.592 --> 00:20:39.844
Mr. Lim! Ms. Wi is here!

00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:43.473
-She's here?
-Damn it.

00:20:43.556 --> 00:20:44.390
Hey, you…

00:20:45.475 --> 00:20:47.560
Run!

00:20:48.144 --> 00:20:49.312
It's that way…

00:20:52.106 --> 00:20:52.940
Damn it.

00:20:55.568 --> 00:20:57.862
Hello, Director. What brings you here?

00:20:57.945 --> 00:21:01.157
Oh, hello there.

00:21:02.075 --> 00:21:05.787
I just stopped by to say hello.

00:21:06.913 --> 00:21:09.499
Hold on. In episode five,

00:21:10.458 --> 00:21:11.834
there's that daydream scene.

00:21:11.918 --> 00:21:12.752
Right.

00:21:12.835 --> 00:21:16.923
I was curious how it'd look.
Could I try on the makeup beforehand?

00:21:17.006 --> 00:21:18.341
You know, like a practice run.

00:21:18.966 --> 00:21:19.801
For what, exactly?

00:21:19.884 --> 00:21:21.886
The scene where
Kang Pil-gu pictures himself in 30 years.

00:21:21.969 --> 00:21:23.387
DIRECTOR BAK BYEONG-GI

00:21:25.264 --> 00:21:26.432
Who are you, sir?

00:21:27.433 --> 00:21:28.351
It's me.

00:21:28.434 --> 00:21:29.644
-Director!
-Director?

00:21:29.727 --> 00:21:30.770
Is the stunt team here?

00:21:30.853 --> 00:21:32.021
Hey, stunt team?

00:21:32.105 --> 00:21:33.606
-But Director, why…
-Your hair…

00:21:33.689 --> 00:21:35.733
Hello, Sports Eunseong readers.

00:21:35.817 --> 00:21:39.487
Thank you for coming to the set
of Kang Pil-gu's fifth season.

00:21:39.987 --> 00:21:41.155
Thank you.

00:21:41.739 --> 00:21:42.865
Great, thank you.

00:21:44.325 --> 00:21:45.493
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

00:21:51.916 --> 00:21:54.085
Thank you for inviting me to the set today

00:21:54.168 --> 00:21:56.295
and for offering me the interview first.

00:21:56.879 --> 00:21:57.964
Goodness.

00:21:58.047 --> 00:22:01.551
I should be the one thanking you
for coming all this way.

00:22:04.095 --> 00:22:05.388
Have you visited a set before?

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.723
No, it's my first time.

00:22:09.308 --> 00:22:12.562
There are more people than I expected.
It's pretty cool.

00:22:13.521 --> 00:22:14.689
Right.

00:22:14.772 --> 00:22:17.650
So could you share a spoiler
from this season of Kang Pil-gu?

00:22:17.733 --> 00:22:18.693
A spoiler?

00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:24.073
It feels weird giving a spoiler myself.

00:22:24.991 --> 00:22:25.825
Well…

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:31.747
Let's say you earned this spoiler
through really hard work, okay?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.086
The biggest plot twist
in season five of Kang Pil-gu

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.963
is Pil-gu going from the people's hero

00:22:39.046 --> 00:22:41.465
to a corrupt detective.

00:22:44.135 --> 00:22:45.011
That's it.

00:22:49.765 --> 00:22:50.850
Can I get your autograph?

00:22:53.728 --> 00:22:56.856
We've met so many times,
and now you want my autograph?

00:22:57.523 --> 00:22:59.192
We're no strangers, so why an autograph?

00:22:59.275 --> 00:23:00.943
How about we just take some photos?

00:23:01.027 --> 00:23:01.861
It's not for me.

00:23:02.445 --> 00:23:03.529
I'm doing a favor for someone.

00:23:06.282 --> 00:23:08.534
My son is a huge fan of Kang Pil-gu.

00:23:08.618 --> 00:23:10.578
You work at the entertainment desk, right?

00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:12.914
Would you mind getting me his autograph?

00:23:12.997 --> 00:23:15.458
His name is Jung Eun-chan,
and please write "Study hard" next to it.

00:23:16.042 --> 00:23:17.668
I heard his dream is
to become a police officer,

00:23:17.752 --> 00:23:20.129
and that he promised to study hard
if he got your autograph.

00:23:20.922 --> 00:23:22.465
"Study hard"?

00:23:32.433 --> 00:23:34.727
TO. JUNG EUN-CHAN
STUDY HARD

00:23:40.358 --> 00:23:41.359
Thank you.

00:23:41.442 --> 00:23:42.276
By the way,

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.320
will you watch the shoot before you leave?

00:23:44.403 --> 00:23:45.655
Yes, of course.

00:23:45.738 --> 00:23:47.615
Shoot coverage adds depth to the article.

00:23:49.784 --> 00:23:50.660
Well…

00:23:51.619 --> 00:23:53.037
When you're done with that,

00:23:54.247 --> 00:23:55.248
will you be busy afterward?

00:23:55.331 --> 00:23:56.332
Yes.

00:23:56.916 --> 00:23:58.334
-You're busy?
-Yes.

00:23:58.417 --> 00:24:00.378
I have a lot of article deadlines to meet.

00:24:00.461 --> 00:24:04.215
It's just that there'll be
a small dinner gathering afterward.

00:24:04.298 --> 00:24:06.968
If you join, you'd have the chance
to talk to other actors.

00:24:07.051 --> 00:24:09.095
And if I get a buzz after a few drinks,

00:24:09.178 --> 00:24:11.931
I might accidentally give away
another spoiler.

00:24:13.015 --> 00:24:14.141
Are you sure you can't make it?

00:24:14.767 --> 00:24:17.478
It's too bad,
but I hope I can join next time.

00:24:18.938 --> 00:24:19.814
There's no next time.

00:24:21.023 --> 00:24:22.984
-Excuse me?
-Today's your last chance.

00:24:28.281 --> 00:24:29.490
Why are you so dense?

00:24:29.573 --> 00:24:32.493
When I ask to see you later,
it means I'm interested in you.

00:24:32.576 --> 00:24:33.869
I want you to join so I can talk to you.

00:24:33.953 --> 00:24:35.162
How can you not get that?

00:24:35.246 --> 00:24:36.831
Do you really need me
to spell it out for you?

00:24:45.464 --> 00:24:46.924
I'm Melomaster.

00:24:50.803 --> 00:24:51.971
I'm Melomaster.

00:24:53.389 --> 00:24:55.599
I'm the one you texted all night,

00:24:55.683 --> 00:24:56.934
opened up to,

00:24:57.018 --> 00:24:58.352
and asked to meet in person.

00:24:59.312 --> 00:25:00.938
I'm that Melomaster!

00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:05.651
Oh, right.
Is Ms. Gwon Se-na not here today?

00:25:05.735 --> 00:25:07.862
She doesn't have
any scenes to shoot today.

00:25:07.945 --> 00:25:08.779
All right.

00:25:17.079 --> 00:25:18.998
GWON SE-NA

00:25:25.463 --> 00:25:27.715
The person you are trying to reach…

00:25:36.349 --> 00:25:38.309
I'm actually a fan
of Lim Hyeon-jun myself.

00:25:38.392 --> 00:25:40.770
I love Kang Pil-gu.

00:25:40.853 --> 00:25:42.396
Wow, I'm so glad we met!

00:25:45.566 --> 00:25:46.484
MELOMASTER

00:25:52.365 --> 00:25:53.407
THE USER HAS DELETED THEIR ACCOUNT.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.329
-Everything's set up, right?
-Yes, it is.

00:26:01.332 --> 00:26:02.583
What's wrong?

00:26:02.666 --> 00:26:03.501
Let's go.

00:26:03.584 --> 00:26:05.294
Why? What is it, Director?

00:26:05.378 --> 00:26:07.213
-Excuse me, Director.
-What's going on?

00:26:27.358 --> 00:26:28.401
Ms. Wi.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.694
-I have something to say--
-Mr. Lim!

00:26:30.778 --> 00:26:31.862
The director wants you.

00:26:32.863 --> 00:26:33.781
Okay.

00:26:33.864 --> 00:26:35.408
-Huh?
-What?

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:37.660
-I just--
-Mr. Lim!

00:26:38.619 --> 00:26:40.121
He wants you to see you now.

00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:43.165
Let's talk later.

00:27:00.891 --> 00:27:01.725
All right.

00:27:02.726 --> 00:27:05.604
I'll be doing my own scenes today

00:27:05.688 --> 00:27:07.148
without a stunt double.

00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:08.065
What?

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:12.403
All right. Let's get started!

00:27:13.446 --> 00:27:15.322
Mi-yeong!

00:27:19.326 --> 00:27:20.286
Where's Mi-yeong?

00:27:21.078 --> 00:27:23.080
What's the point of asking
when you're about to die?

00:27:23.664 --> 00:27:25.624
They say you can't fix people.

00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:27.918
But…

00:27:29.336 --> 00:27:30.796
I do.

00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:32.798
What are you waiting for?

00:27:32.882 --> 00:27:33.799
Kill him!

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.307
Get him, boys!

00:27:46.937 --> 00:27:47.771
Excuse me.

00:27:52.401 --> 00:27:54.695
Damn it!

00:27:54.778 --> 00:27:56.238
Get him, you bastards!

00:28:20.221 --> 00:28:21.055
Mi-yeong!

00:28:23.807 --> 00:28:24.850
Mi-yeong!

00:28:25.601 --> 00:28:26.435
Mi-yeong!

00:28:39.073 --> 00:28:40.241
Are you okay?

00:28:43.953 --> 00:28:45.287
Are you hurt?

00:28:48.624 --> 00:28:49.458
It's okay.

00:28:53.087 --> 00:28:54.505
What do you think you're doing?

00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:56.257
Answer me!

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.801
What do you think you two are doing?

00:28:59.677 --> 00:29:00.511
Hey!

00:29:01.804 --> 00:29:02.721
No.

00:29:05.724 --> 00:29:07.268
You bastard!

00:29:08.727 --> 00:29:09.562
No.

00:29:11.021 --> 00:29:13.482
-There's a mouse!
-What the hell?

00:29:13.566 --> 00:29:15.734
-There's a mouse!
-Cut.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.154
It's okay.

00:29:19.238 --> 00:29:20.906
It's just a mouse.

00:29:21.782 --> 00:29:24.493
Let's go again. That's fine.

00:29:24.577 --> 00:29:26.287
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.455
-I thought she meant leg cramp.
-Let's roll again.

00:29:28.539 --> 00:29:29.498
Action!

00:29:29.582 --> 00:29:30.708
What do you think you're doing?

00:29:32.876 --> 00:29:34.837
Damn, the prop broke.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.463
-What?
-This thing here.

00:29:36.547 --> 00:29:37.590
-Cut.
-Cut.

00:29:38.173 --> 00:29:39.883
Props team, switch it out.

00:29:41.302 --> 00:29:42.928
Oh, it broke. That's fine.

00:29:43.012 --> 00:29:44.680
-Action!
-What do you think you're doing?

00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:47.349
-Hold on!
-What is it?

00:29:47.433 --> 00:29:48.475
That really hurt.

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:49.393
Action!

00:29:55.399 --> 00:29:57.401
-What the hell?
-Man, what was that?

00:30:00.988 --> 00:30:02.865
Who left this lying around?

00:30:03.782 --> 00:30:05.159
Let's take a ten-minute break.

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.371
Did I get too worked up?

00:30:10.956 --> 00:30:11.957
Totally.

00:30:12.666 --> 00:30:15.294
You were yelling at the top of your lungs.

00:30:15.377 --> 00:30:17.004
"Who left this?"

00:30:17.087 --> 00:30:18.422
Was I really that awful?

00:30:18.505 --> 00:30:21.050
Totally.

00:30:21.133 --> 00:30:24.386
Why did you insist on doing it
when you had a stunt double?

00:30:25.512 --> 00:30:27.181
Are you that eager to impress Ms. Wi?

00:30:27.264 --> 00:30:30.017
It's not like that.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.352
Yeah, right.

00:30:31.435 --> 00:30:33.896
Do you want to date Ms. Wi or something?

00:30:33.979 --> 00:30:36.315
I said it's not like that.

00:30:36.398 --> 00:30:40.319
I just don't want her
writing up another bad article.

00:30:41.111 --> 00:30:44.573
I get how you developed feelings
through Onion or Green Onion or whatever,

00:30:44.657 --> 00:30:48.202
but don't confuse
imaginary dating with the real thing.

00:30:48.285 --> 00:30:49.703
Who said I was?

00:30:50.704 --> 00:30:52.122
Besides, I deleted Onion.

00:30:52.206 --> 00:30:53.082
So what if you deleted it?

00:30:53.582 --> 00:30:55.125
Does that make Ms. Wi go away?

00:30:57.211 --> 00:30:58.754
Be careful

00:30:58.837 --> 00:31:00.506
unless you want
another dating rumor going around.

00:31:02.633 --> 00:31:03.509
A dating rumor?

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.311
Please talk Mr. Lim out of it.

00:31:14.395 --> 00:31:17.398
This cut will only show his back,
so we can use his double.

00:31:17.481 --> 00:31:19.525
But he insists on doing it himself.

00:31:19.608 --> 00:31:22.027
It's because Ms. Wi is here.

00:31:22.528 --> 00:31:25.698
She's a Kang Pil-gu fan,
so of course, he wants to do it himself.

00:31:25.781 --> 00:31:27.282
-Okay, fine.
-Byeong-gi!

00:31:30.994 --> 00:31:31.912
What is it?

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:36.083
Come with me.

00:31:42.881 --> 00:31:43.882
Damn it.

00:31:53.267 --> 00:31:55.728
I just twisted it a little
during practice.

00:31:56.395 --> 00:31:59.606
I told them I can't do any stunts today
because I hurt my ankle.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:00.607
I really did.

00:32:02.484 --> 00:32:04.778
-Pil-gu's stunt double, we need you now.
-I'll be right there.

00:32:04.862 --> 00:32:05.696
Quickly, please!

00:32:05.779 --> 00:32:06.989
Honey, they need me. Bye.

00:32:23.672 --> 00:32:24.631
All right.

00:32:24.715 --> 00:32:27.551
I'll be doing my own scenes today

00:32:27.634 --> 00:32:29.595
without a stunt double.

00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:43.484
Ready.

00:32:43.567 --> 00:32:44.568
Action!

00:32:44.651 --> 00:32:46.779
What do you think you're doing,
you bastard?

00:32:47.946 --> 00:32:48.822
Damn you!

00:32:59.041 --> 00:33:01.710
-Mr. Lim! Call an ambulance now!
-Okay.

00:33:03.128 --> 00:33:04.588
Oh, damn it.

00:33:04.671 --> 00:33:07.090
-Hurry and call an ambulance.
-I'm on it.

00:33:07.174 --> 00:33:08.592
I heard something crack in his ankle.

00:33:12.888 --> 00:33:13.722
Be careful.

00:33:15.265 --> 00:33:16.683
Mr. Lim, please take care.

00:33:16.767 --> 00:33:19.603
-Get home safely!
-Take care!

00:33:19.686 --> 00:33:21.480
Don't worry about a thing.

00:33:21.563 --> 00:33:23.357
-Make sure you go to the hospital!
-Don't worry.

00:33:24.525 --> 00:33:25.984
Ms. Wi, you're still here?

00:33:27.528 --> 00:33:28.737
Is your ankle okay?

00:33:29.446 --> 00:33:31.156
It looked like you hurt your shoulder too.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.826
Oh, I'm fine.

00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:36.411
I just sprained it a bit. It's fine.

00:33:36.495 --> 00:33:37.496
My shoulder's fine too.

00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:40.040
Wait, why can't I lift it?

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.334
Just kidding.

00:33:43.544 --> 00:33:46.004
You went through a lot today.
I hope you get it treated properly.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.632
Come here for a second.

00:33:48.715 --> 00:33:49.550
Come here.

00:33:50.634 --> 00:33:52.511
Make sure to release the exclusive today,

00:33:52.594 --> 00:33:54.137
about how I injured myself doing a stunt.

00:33:54.721 --> 00:33:56.598
You're concerned about my article
at a time like this?

00:33:56.682 --> 00:33:59.434
You came all this way,
so you should leave with an exclusive.

00:33:59.518 --> 00:34:01.311
Word will spread
once I get to the hospital,

00:34:01.395 --> 00:34:03.480
so write it up here
and release it immediately, okay?

00:34:04.022 --> 00:34:05.232
How about a high-five?

00:34:10.028 --> 00:34:12.114
Excuse us, Ms. Wi.
We need to get to the hospital.

00:34:12.197 --> 00:34:13.657
I'm very sorry.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:16.618
Let's get going.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:43.186
Were you injured badly?

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.064
No, not at all. I don't really need this.

00:34:46.148 --> 00:34:47.608
I'm just keeping it on for the day.

00:34:47.691 --> 00:34:51.153
Didn't you say you'd confess your feelings
to Ms. Wi after today's shoot?

00:34:52.696 --> 00:34:55.407
Confess my feelings?
Come on, we're not kids.

00:34:57.409 --> 00:34:59.661
I wanted to get friendly
at the dinner gathering,

00:34:59.745 --> 00:35:02.289
but who knew
I'd get injured like this today?

00:35:02.372 --> 00:35:03.665
You should know,

00:35:03.749 --> 00:35:08.086
Ms. Wi was very worried for me
when I hurt my ankle.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:10.714
So today wasn't a total loss.

00:35:10.797 --> 00:35:11.965
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:35:12.382 --> 00:35:14.384
You've never dated anyone, have you?

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:15.969
What do you mean?

00:35:16.053 --> 00:35:18.764
Or maybe it's been so long
since you last dated

00:35:18.847 --> 00:35:20.474
that you've forgotten how it goes?

00:35:23.518 --> 00:35:26.897
Why do you have to talk
in such a rude way?

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.191
Now that I think about it,
you and Ms. Wi are exactly the same.

00:35:29.274 --> 00:35:31.360
No wonder you two get along.

00:35:31.443 --> 00:35:32.736
Maybe that's why we're both competent.

00:35:34.154 --> 00:35:37.115
If you're so competent,
why not manage your dating life yourself?

00:35:37.199 --> 00:35:39.910
Why bother teaming up with me?

00:35:40.494 --> 00:35:43.830
This would be over if things went well
between you and Mr. Lee Jae-hyeong.

00:35:43.914 --> 00:35:47.292
You obviously can't do it on your own,
which is why you roped me into this.

00:35:48.543 --> 00:35:49.461
It's always harder

00:35:50.295 --> 00:35:53.632
to glue a broken relationship
back together.

00:35:53.715 --> 00:35:56.843
Are you saying
that I have to put in the hard work,

00:35:56.927 --> 00:35:58.929
while you reap the benefits?

00:35:59.513 --> 00:36:01.515
I really wish that were the case,

00:36:01.598 --> 00:36:04.726
but if I leave this up to you,
we'll both end up with nothing.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.520
So I put together a simple plan.

00:36:07.187 --> 00:36:11.984
It'd cause major problems in my life
if you can't win over Ms. Wi,

00:36:12.609 --> 00:36:14.194
so do it right this time.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.323
What's your plan?

00:36:20.075 --> 00:36:22.619
I already wrote an exclusive
on Lim Hyeon-jun getting injured on set.

00:36:22.703 --> 00:36:24.663
What more follow-up coverage do I need?

00:36:24.746 --> 00:36:27.082
I'm not his personal paparazzi.

00:36:27.165 --> 00:36:29.751
You said you were a fan of Kang Pil-gu.
Isn't this good for you?

00:36:29.835 --> 00:36:32.504
I said I was Kang Pil-gu's fan,
not Lim Hyeon-jun's!

00:36:33.088 --> 00:36:36.758
Please don't tell me
you told Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun about this.

00:36:37.342 --> 00:36:38.427
I didn't.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:41.054
Anyway, I keep my personal life
and work life separate.

00:36:41.138 --> 00:36:42.347
Yeah, right.

00:36:42.431 --> 00:36:44.141
Then why did you
file a motion for recusal?

00:36:44.224 --> 00:36:46.184
-That was--
-I'm serving an exclusive

00:36:46.268 --> 00:36:48.895
on a silver platter for you.
Shouldn't you thank me instead of arguing?

00:36:48.979 --> 00:36:50.605
Want me to tie you
to the entertainment desk?

00:36:51.398 --> 00:36:53.400
If I'm getting tied down,
I'll bring my own rope!

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.194
Fine, then.
Come back to the office for now.

00:36:56.903 --> 00:36:59.823
Jeez, her and her threats.

00:37:00.449 --> 00:37:03.785
I need you to adjust my schedule.

00:37:03.869 --> 00:37:05.620
I'm doing my best to cooperate with you.

00:37:05.704 --> 00:37:07.622
What do you mean, "cooperate"?
I'm exhausted.

00:37:08.331 --> 00:37:10.667
-We're trying our best to enjoy shooting.
-Look…

00:37:10.751 --> 00:37:12.794
How would I enjoy shooting
when my schedule's a mess?

00:37:13.295 --> 00:37:16.131
-I'm trying my best to cooperate…
-Cooperate with who?

00:37:25.515 --> 00:37:26.391
Stop that.

00:37:38.653 --> 00:37:39.696
I can't believe he deleted his account.

00:37:42.491 --> 00:37:44.159
Without telling me, too.

00:37:56.671 --> 00:37:58.381
Hello?

00:37:59.382 --> 00:38:01.301
Is this Onion's customer service center?

00:38:02.552 --> 00:38:05.555
Can I get the phone number
of a user who deleted their account?

00:38:06.139 --> 00:38:08.642
Right, I'm sorry for bothering you.

00:38:09.684 --> 00:38:12.771
But why can't you tell me?

00:38:14.564 --> 00:38:17.150
I got scammed on Onion!

00:38:17.234 --> 00:38:19.611
The rice cooker…

00:38:20.195 --> 00:38:24.157
I bought this rice cooker,
and the person who sold it…

00:38:24.241 --> 00:38:26.493
But my rice cooker…

00:38:26.576 --> 00:38:27.953
My rice cooker…

00:38:28.036 --> 00:38:31.373
How could he do this to me?

00:38:34.459 --> 00:38:37.838
How could he?

00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:42.509
My rice cooker…

00:38:46.388 --> 00:38:47.681
My rice cooker…

00:38:49.474 --> 00:38:51.935
How could he do this?

00:39:17.669 --> 00:39:19.212
Got you. Got you.

00:39:27.512 --> 00:39:30.473
This is to make up
for the dinner I had with Mr. Lee.

00:39:40.483 --> 00:39:42.485
Don't people usually give two tickets?

00:39:42.569 --> 00:39:43.862
Do you have someone to go with?

00:39:45.488 --> 00:39:46.323
No.

00:39:46.823 --> 00:39:50.577
It's a VIP ticket sent to me in my name,
so there's only one.

00:39:51.077 --> 00:39:52.913
Make sure you don't give it away
and go yourself.

00:39:55.123 --> 00:39:55.957
I will.

00:39:56.041 --> 00:39:57.459
I'm going to check if you actually went.

00:39:59.169 --> 00:40:00.045
Chief.

00:40:01.546 --> 00:40:03.590
When you and Mr. Lee were together,

00:40:04.174 --> 00:40:06.968
did you know about his family?

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.429
No matter how awful Lee Dae-ho may be,

00:40:10.597 --> 00:40:12.307
it has nothing to do with Lee Jae-hyeong.

00:40:13.225 --> 00:40:14.351
How can you be so sure?

00:40:14.434 --> 00:40:15.602
I'm a reporter too.

00:40:17.145 --> 00:40:18.855
I can easily find out that much.

00:41:01.481 --> 00:41:02.315
Hey.

00:41:02.983 --> 00:41:04.859
What brings you here, Ms. Wi?

00:41:05.485 --> 00:41:07.445
That's my seat.

00:41:07.529 --> 00:41:09.030
This one right next to me?

00:41:10.949 --> 00:41:11.908
No way.

00:41:12.701 --> 00:41:14.160
What in the world?

00:41:15.495 --> 00:41:16.496
I mean,

00:41:17.122 --> 00:41:18.415
what a coincidence.

00:41:19.124 --> 00:41:22.669
Man, who would've thought, right?

00:41:24.254 --> 00:41:25.130
I know.

00:41:25.672 --> 00:41:26.881
My gosh.

00:41:27.382 --> 00:41:28.758
How's your ankle?

00:41:29.676 --> 00:41:31.970
Oh, it's totally fine.

00:41:32.053 --> 00:41:35.348
I work out and stay in solid shape,

00:41:35.432 --> 00:41:37.392
so I recover quickly from injuries.

00:41:37.475 --> 00:41:38.351
Ms. Wi?

00:41:40.395 --> 00:41:41.479
-So it is you.
-Mr. Lee.

00:41:42.063 --> 00:41:42.897
Your seat is next to mine.

00:41:44.149 --> 00:41:46.318
Let's sit down.

00:41:48.403 --> 00:41:50.697
I'll take this as an apology
for not showing up to dinner that night.

00:41:51.239 --> 00:41:52.490
I won't take no for an answer.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:54.534
Okay.

00:41:55.285 --> 00:41:56.244
Who's this?

00:41:56.828 --> 00:41:59.497
Hello, I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

00:41:59.581 --> 00:42:02.250
Mother, Ms. Wi is a very capable employee

00:42:02.334 --> 00:42:03.543
who's very good at her job.

00:42:04.753 --> 00:42:08.590
My mother has a cameo in this movie,
so I came to watch it with her.

00:42:08.673 --> 00:42:09.632
I see.

00:42:09.716 --> 00:42:10.633
Goodness.

00:42:10.717 --> 00:42:12.969
Not only are you beautiful,
you're also good at your job.

00:42:13.053 --> 00:42:15.638
Please take good care of my son.

00:42:15.722 --> 00:42:17.932
And me too.

00:42:21.019 --> 00:42:22.645
Ms. Oh, I'm here too.

00:42:23.229 --> 00:42:25.231
Gosh, you're here too?

00:42:25.315 --> 00:42:26.858
-When did you get here?
-Hello.

00:42:26.941 --> 00:42:29.527
-Good to see you again.
-Likewise.

00:42:29.611 --> 00:42:33.490
We have such an unusual connection.

00:42:35.116 --> 00:42:37.494
-You're done already?
-It was just club time, so I bailed.

00:42:37.577 --> 00:42:38.620
No one will look for me anyway.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.207
-Anyway, what's up?
-Tomorrow's your birthday.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:43.291
We should get your ears pierced.

00:42:44.167 --> 00:42:45.668
Why would I get my ears pierced
on my birthday?

00:42:45.752 --> 00:42:48.713
What if your ears
actually fall off on your birthday?

00:42:49.547 --> 00:42:50.423
What?

00:42:51.049 --> 00:42:54.052
-You see, that's why…
-What did you talk about?

00:42:55.762 --> 00:42:57.472
It was about the movie.

00:42:58.556 --> 00:43:00.100
Then why did you laugh?

00:43:00.183 --> 00:43:01.267
Because it was funny.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.144
Ms. Wi.

00:43:03.645 --> 00:43:06.481
The three of us should have dinner
when you have the time.

00:43:17.784 --> 00:43:18.993
I'm here!

00:43:19.077 --> 00:43:20.161
Hey, you're here.

00:43:20.578 --> 00:43:22.205
-My friend's sleeping over.
-Okay.

00:43:22.288 --> 00:43:23.289
Hello, sir.

00:43:23.373 --> 00:43:24.624
Hello.

00:43:26.668 --> 00:43:28.837
It's a VIP ticket sent to me in my name,

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.047
so there's only one.

00:43:31.131 --> 00:43:33.091
Make sure you don't give it away

00:43:33.633 --> 00:43:34.759
and go yourself.

00:43:41.015 --> 00:43:43.935
The teacher complimented you,
saying you were funny.

00:43:44.602 --> 00:43:47.021
That's unexpected.
He usually badmouths me.

00:43:48.022 --> 00:43:49.023
Hey.

00:43:49.858 --> 00:43:52.610
You can't drink after piercing your ears.
Are you crazy?

00:43:53.111 --> 00:43:54.154
Why not?

00:43:54.237 --> 00:43:55.447
HWANG JI-SUN

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:58.199
-Oh, boy.
-How much did you have to drink?

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:00.743
I didn't drink that much.
I'm totally fine.

00:44:11.421 --> 00:44:12.630
I'm already getting flushed.

00:44:16.968 --> 00:44:18.720
What's going on?

00:44:18.803 --> 00:44:21.222
I have something important to tell you.

00:44:21.306 --> 00:44:22.223
I'll see you at home.

00:44:22.307 --> 00:44:24.058
If it's important,
why are we meeting at home

00:44:24.559 --> 00:44:25.977
instead of at the office?

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.312
Because it's important.

00:44:27.395 --> 00:44:28.897
No, I can't.

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.815
I told you
I had to attend a movie premiere.

00:44:30.899 --> 00:44:33.401
It's almost over. I know you're not busy.

00:44:34.486 --> 00:44:37.030
I have a private life too, you know!

00:44:37.113 --> 00:44:38.948
Whatever. Meet me at home.

00:44:42.911 --> 00:44:44.746
What did he say? Is he coming?

00:44:45.872 --> 00:44:47.165
He'll come. It's his home, after all.

00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:50.543
Mr. Hwang.

00:44:51.211 --> 00:44:53.963
I'm counting on you, okay?

00:44:54.047 --> 00:44:54.923
All right.

00:44:58.843 --> 00:45:00.428
What's the matter with him?

00:45:10.855 --> 00:45:12.065
I'm leaving.

00:45:14.734 --> 00:45:17.737
Do you like him
enough to quit school and leave?

00:45:18.321 --> 00:45:21.074
She had something urgent come up and left.

00:45:21.157 --> 00:45:22.200
I see.

00:45:22.283 --> 00:45:24.536
Still, you can't just leave like this.

00:45:25.745 --> 00:45:27.247
You won't even explain anything to me.

00:45:30.792 --> 00:45:31.668
Thank you.

00:45:35.255 --> 00:45:36.089
I'm sorry.

00:45:36.673 --> 00:45:38.675
I couldn't answer
because I had a meeting that day.

00:45:39.551 --> 00:45:40.510
It's okay.

00:45:41.261 --> 00:45:42.845
You said you have something to tell me?

00:45:42.929 --> 00:45:46.349
-You asked about Ha Gee-wan before.
-Yes.

00:45:46.432 --> 00:45:49.310
I don't know the exact details,
but I know for a fact

00:45:50.103 --> 00:45:53.231
that Ha Gee-wan and Lee Dae-ho
both love money.

00:45:57.902 --> 00:46:00.446
That means the two are involved
in a suspicious financial deal.

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:02.115
Yes.

00:46:02.198 --> 00:46:03.783
A big one, that is.

00:46:04.325 --> 00:46:06.035
Why do you think my company
and Lim Hyeon-jun's company

00:46:06.119 --> 00:46:07.745
decided to merge?

00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:10.415
Are you saying
there was an ulterior motive to that?

00:46:26.055 --> 00:46:27.724
I met with Wi Jeong-sin.

00:46:27.807 --> 00:46:29.267
I told her what you wanted me to…

00:46:30.727 --> 00:46:31.728
as if I was dropping a hint.

00:46:48.036 --> 00:46:50.496
Mr. Lim, here's a link
to Ms. Wi's article.

00:46:53.958 --> 00:46:55.251
[EXCLUSIVE] GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5
HOLDS OPEN SET

00:46:55.335 --> 00:46:56.961
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN
SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:04.552
Where did she disappear to anyway?

00:47:06.137 --> 00:47:07.889
Let go of me!

00:47:07.972 --> 00:47:09.891
I don't care if it takes hours!

00:47:09.974 --> 00:47:12.018
I'll stay like this until he forgives me!

00:47:16.731 --> 00:47:19.150
What in the world is going on?

00:47:19.734 --> 00:47:21.527
Mom?

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.947
-Seon-u.
-Yeah?

00:47:25.031 --> 00:47:26.366
Why is Mr. Hwang kneeling?

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.789
Why isn't anyone saying anything?

00:47:33.456 --> 00:47:36.918
What were you guys doing in my house
when I wasn't even home?

00:47:37.001 --> 00:47:38.002
Bro,

00:47:38.503 --> 00:47:40.421
I did something completely unforgivable.

00:47:40.922 --> 00:47:42.048
-Oh, gosh.
-Mr. Lim.

00:47:43.132 --> 00:47:45.051
Please relax and hear me out, okay?

00:47:47.095 --> 00:47:49.430
How am I supposed to relax
when I don't know what's going on?

00:47:49.514 --> 00:47:51.182
Will you guys say something?

00:47:51.265 --> 00:47:53.309
This silence isn't helping anyone!

00:47:56.145 --> 00:47:57.939
-Hyeon-jun.
-Yeah?

00:47:59.899 --> 00:48:01.901
I got a role in Kang Pil-gu.

00:48:12.203 --> 00:48:14.163
I don't care what you say. I'm doing it.

00:48:14.247 --> 00:48:15.665
The director said it was fine.

00:48:16.165 --> 00:48:17.083
Why…

00:48:18.334 --> 00:48:20.461
Why is everyone doing this to me?

00:48:20.545 --> 00:48:22.505
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

00:48:23.005 --> 00:48:25.800
The whole world knows that Seong Ae-suk

00:48:25.883 --> 00:48:29.512
is Lim Hyeon-jun's mother!

00:48:29.595 --> 00:48:31.389
Now they're acting in the same drama?

00:48:32.098 --> 00:48:32.932
Mom.

00:48:33.015 --> 00:48:35.518
Seon-u's playing my younger self.

00:48:35.601 --> 00:48:38.146
This isn't some family drama.
We'll be the laughingstock!

00:48:38.229 --> 00:48:39.272
How does this make sense?

00:48:39.355 --> 00:48:40.189
Well…

00:48:40.773 --> 00:48:43.776
She won't be playing
your biological mother.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.194
It's just a cameo…

00:48:45.278 --> 00:48:48.156
And Ms. Seong's hasn't made
any public appearances lately,

00:48:48.239 --> 00:48:50.032
so I'm sure
people won't even recognize her.

00:48:50.116 --> 00:48:51.576
Right?

00:48:51.659 --> 00:48:53.369
I look the same as I did back then,

00:48:53.453 --> 00:48:55.288
so I'm sure they'll recognize me.

00:48:55.371 --> 00:48:56.914
Mom.

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:01.419
Please let her do it, Mr. Lim.

00:49:01.502 --> 00:49:04.422
I'm positive Ms. Seong will be
the scene-stealer of that episode.

00:49:05.423 --> 00:49:06.674
-A scene-stealer?
-Yes.

00:49:06.758 --> 00:49:08.885
Are you trying to use my family?

00:49:08.968 --> 00:49:10.595
No, of course not.

00:49:14.223 --> 00:49:16.559
Hyeon-jun took it better
than we thought, right?

00:49:17.769 --> 00:49:18.686
Yes.

00:49:19.187 --> 00:49:22.523
Getting on my knees and going full method

00:49:23.191 --> 00:49:24.984
was a stroke of genius.

00:49:25.067 --> 00:49:27.862
Oh, how are your knees?
You were really into it earlier.

00:49:27.945 --> 00:49:29.322
They're fine. I'm used to kneeling.

00:49:31.365 --> 00:49:32.492
Mr. Hwang.

00:49:32.575 --> 00:49:34.243
I really appreciate you.

00:49:35.703 --> 00:49:37.246
Oh, how about some green onion kimchi?

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:38.331
No!

00:49:40.708 --> 00:49:43.377
From now on,
I refuse to eat onions, green onions,

00:49:43.461 --> 00:49:45.046
or any other food that includes "onion."

00:49:45.129 --> 00:49:46.422
Try some of this.

00:49:46.506 --> 00:49:47.715
Get that onion out of the way.

00:49:49.133 --> 00:49:51.385
Wait, there's onion in this.
I'm not eating it.

00:49:51.469 --> 00:49:54.013
By the way, is Hyeon-jun not going to eat?

00:49:54.096 --> 00:49:56.182
He says he's on a diet.

00:49:56.891 --> 00:49:58.017
I get it.

00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.894
Mom and I are
causing him trouble in turns,

00:50:00.853 --> 00:50:02.146
so of course, he's not hungry.

00:50:04.899 --> 00:50:07.944
Why did you have to get into acting
and make a mess of things?

00:50:08.528 --> 00:50:09.654
Seriously.

00:50:12.156 --> 00:50:13.491
Damn it.

00:50:15.034 --> 00:50:17.662
Why would Pil-gu do something like this?

00:50:17.745 --> 00:50:18.996
Seriously, it's Pil-gu.

00:50:20.039 --> 00:50:21.123
It's absurd!

00:50:28.548 --> 00:50:30.466
There's no way the viewers will like this!

00:50:33.553 --> 00:50:35.847
Oh, boy.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:37.807
Not this again, damn it.

00:50:49.527 --> 00:50:51.904
SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:50:59.161 --> 00:51:01.330
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

00:51:01.414 --> 00:51:03.624
Hello, everyone.

00:51:07.712 --> 00:51:09.505
Ms. Wi didn't come to work today.

00:51:13.718 --> 00:51:16.262
Is something going on?
I haven't seen her in a while.

00:51:16.345 --> 00:51:18.389
I might tell you
if you have lunch with me.

00:51:20.474 --> 00:51:22.143
Lunchtime is still a long way off.

00:51:22.977 --> 00:51:23.811
Brunch, then?

00:51:32.987 --> 00:51:35.865
So, why didn't Ms. Wi come to work today?

00:51:36.741 --> 00:51:38.784
-Did something happen?
-What's the rush?

00:51:43.372 --> 00:51:44.206
Please eat.

00:52:01.557 --> 00:52:02.391
Well?

00:52:02.475 --> 00:52:07.146
You finished your meal,
had dessert, and even had tea.

00:52:07.229 --> 00:52:08.439
When will you tell me?

00:52:08.522 --> 00:52:11.734
I assigned Ms. Wi
to cover Lim Hyeon-jun exclusively.

00:52:11.817 --> 00:52:13.653
She's been busy following him around.

00:52:13.736 --> 00:52:14.695
Covering Lim Hyeon-jun exclusively?

00:52:14.779 --> 00:52:17.365
You dragged this out just to tell me that?

00:52:17.448 --> 00:52:20.618
Weren't you acting like
you were dragged here against your will?

00:52:21.202 --> 00:52:23.162
I purposely took my time eating

00:52:23.746 --> 00:52:24.997
because I wanted to spend time with you.

00:52:34.423 --> 00:52:36.217
I've been curious for a while.

00:52:36.717 --> 00:52:38.010
What's with you?

00:52:40.388 --> 00:52:43.891
Now that I'm a mom,
there's nothing I'm afraid of.

00:52:43.975 --> 00:52:45.893
Is that why you're being
so shameless with me?

00:52:45.977 --> 00:52:48.104
Yes. I'm shameless now.

00:52:53.067 --> 00:52:54.819
Why did you do that then?

00:52:56.487 --> 00:52:57.488
Shall we get going?

00:52:58.197 --> 00:52:59.448
I have a lunch appointment.

00:52:59.532 --> 00:53:00.408
What?

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:01.951
You just ate.

00:53:02.034 --> 00:53:03.411
I can eat again.

00:53:17.633 --> 00:53:20.469
Weren't you acting like
you were dragged here against your will?

00:53:20.553 --> 00:53:22.596
I purposely took my time eating

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.889
because I wanted to spend time with you.

00:53:32.565 --> 00:53:34.775
-What?
-You have a lunch appointment too?

00:53:34.859 --> 00:53:35.985
What the heck?

00:53:52.334 --> 00:53:53.669
I already ate.

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:55.546
Just order something light.

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:57.673
I haven't eaten yet.

00:54:01.093 --> 00:54:02.970
Fine, order whatever you want.

00:54:03.804 --> 00:54:04.722
By the way,

00:54:05.765 --> 00:54:08.476
why do you keep bringing me along
whenever you meet with agencies?

00:54:08.559 --> 00:54:09.602
Are you complaining?

00:54:09.685 --> 00:54:10.853
Not at all.

00:54:10.936 --> 00:54:13.230
You seem to like me more than I thought,

00:54:13.314 --> 00:54:14.356
so it feels a bit much.

00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:19.111
I'll return to the political desk

00:54:20.279 --> 00:54:21.572
at some point.

00:54:22.448 --> 00:54:24.992
There was a time
when I thought the same about myself.

00:54:26.035 --> 00:54:27.411
But life is unpredictable.

00:54:30.247 --> 00:54:31.457
Are you cursing me?

00:54:33.793 --> 00:54:35.211
There's a lot of talk about the merger.

00:54:35.795 --> 00:54:39.006
People are grumbling about me
building a massive entertainment company,

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:40.508
but I don't pay attention to that.

00:54:41.425 --> 00:54:43.719
That's their way of dealing with
not getting what they wanted.

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:46.514
I heard there are many who envy you.

00:54:47.681 --> 00:54:48.682
Is that so?

00:54:53.187 --> 00:54:56.440
You had an acting career
before your success as Kang Pil-gu, right?

00:54:57.233 --> 00:54:59.944
Yes, I acted a bit.

00:55:00.027 --> 00:55:01.153
But well,

00:55:01.862 --> 00:55:04.615
I had to give it up quicky
because of some circumstances.

00:55:04.698 --> 00:55:08.327
Would it be rude to ask
what those circumstances were?

00:55:08.994 --> 00:55:11.038
No, but it wasn't anything special.

00:55:12.414 --> 00:55:16.043
I wasn't getting any offers
and needed to make a living, so I quit.

00:55:22.258 --> 00:55:24.426
I'm in front of the restaurant.
I need to see you.

00:55:29.056 --> 00:55:31.600
I'm sorry to have you wait,

00:55:32.143 --> 00:55:33.644
but could you excuse me for a moment?

00:55:33.727 --> 00:55:35.146
-Of course.
-Go on and eat.

00:55:42.486 --> 00:55:43.571
Let's eat.

00:55:43.654 --> 00:55:44.780
Yes, thank you.

00:56:21.483 --> 00:56:24.028
You must be all fired up,
coming all the way here.

00:56:24.111 --> 00:56:25.154
I did what you told me to.

00:56:25.237 --> 00:56:26.488
What are you planning to do?

00:56:27.573 --> 00:56:29.992
Why? Does it bother you
that I'm getting close to Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:56:30.075 --> 00:56:31.577
I can deal with that.

00:56:32.203 --> 00:56:33.787
It's not that it bothers me.

00:56:33.871 --> 00:56:34.830
It scares me.

00:56:37.374 --> 00:56:39.210
Se-na, don't be like this.

00:56:39.752 --> 00:56:40.586
Okay?

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:42.379
The more anxious you get,

00:56:43.714 --> 00:56:46.217
the more I want to make things harder
for Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:56:49.261 --> 00:56:50.346
Are you going to

00:56:50.971 --> 00:56:52.306
kill him too?

00:56:53.933 --> 00:56:55.935
The chairman seems very interested in me.

00:56:56.018 --> 00:56:59.313
He probably wants to get closer
now that you're an actor in his company.

00:56:59.396 --> 00:57:01.273
It's a little old-fashioned,

00:57:01.357 --> 00:57:03.442
but some believe
you need to share personal details

00:57:03.525 --> 00:57:04.944
to get to know each other better.

00:57:07.988 --> 00:57:10.616
Well, I'd like to
get to know you better, Mr. Lee.

00:57:11.408 --> 00:57:13.202
Could I ask a personal question?

00:57:13.285 --> 00:57:14.954
Yes, go ahead.

00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:19.917
Are you seeing anyone right now?

00:57:22.711 --> 00:57:25.756
Well, I do have feelings for someone.

00:57:28.092 --> 00:57:29.009
You have…

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:33.055
You have a crush on someone.

00:57:34.598 --> 00:57:35.891
A crush?

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.434
You know,

00:57:38.477 --> 00:57:41.772
having a long-term crush
can't be healthy for either side.

00:57:41.855 --> 00:57:44.275
You lack for nothing
and have so much going for you.

00:57:45.818 --> 00:57:47.611
Why have a crush on someone?

00:57:50.614 --> 00:57:52.116
I'm lacking in many ways,

00:57:52.199 --> 00:57:55.119
especially when it comes to
winning over the person I like.

00:57:56.745 --> 00:57:58.414
I'll keep trying, though.

00:57:59.248 --> 00:58:01.000
Even if I get struck out.

00:58:18.434 --> 00:58:19.310
Ms. Wi!

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:22.229
Hello.

00:58:23.814 --> 00:58:25.274
Hello.

00:58:26.025 --> 00:58:27.067
What brings you here?

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.113
Oh, I had some business to handle.

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:37.369
If you're done eating,
would you like to have tea with me?

00:58:41.332 --> 00:58:42.166
Shall we?

00:58:46.962 --> 00:58:48.005
I'll join.

00:58:51.216 --> 00:58:52.843
Me too.

00:58:54.053 --> 00:58:55.637
I'll join too.

00:59:51.235 --> 00:59:53.445
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

00:59:55.948 --> 00:59:57.783
You know the date's been set for
our production press conference, right?

00:59:58.367 --> 00:59:59.993
Wait, are you going?

01:00:00.077 --> 01:00:01.995
Every entertainment reporter
will be there!

01:00:02.079 --> 01:00:04.540
How did I get caught up in this mess?

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.459
Bro, she's here. Ms. Wi is here!

01:00:07.543 --> 01:00:09.294
What am I supposed to do now?

01:00:09.378 --> 01:00:12.548
Mr. Lim, I can't keep hiding like this.

01:00:12.631 --> 01:00:13.715
What's the matter with you?

01:00:13.799 --> 01:00:15.384
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun, do you like me?

01:00:15.467 --> 01:00:18.262
I don't know. What is it that women want?

01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:23.434
You heartless one

01:00:27.646 --> 01:00:29.648
