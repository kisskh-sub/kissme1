00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:18.391
Anything else?

00:01:18.392 --> 00:01:21.312
Boss, I really can't figure out
what happened tonight.

00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:23.592
Wasn't Auntie killed by Song Ming?

00:01:23.632 --> 00:01:26.112
Since your goal is to take revenge
on the Song family,

00:01:26.212 --> 00:01:28.031
even if you want to protect yourself,

00:01:28.032 --> 00:01:30.361
you didn't have to actually
hand everything to Song Ming.

00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:31.149
Isn't that basically

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.350
helping him sit
in the provincial chairman's seat?

00:01:33.487 --> 00:01:34.607
Let me ask you.

00:01:35.072 --> 00:01:37.751
Back then, when Song Ming followed
Master Jin to take Jiangzhou,

00:01:37.752 --> 00:01:40.751
why is it that after Master Jin
became the Jiangzhou commander,

00:01:40.752 --> 00:01:42.871
he only gave Song Ming
a mayor's position,

00:01:42.872 --> 00:01:44.592
with no military power at all?

00:01:46.737 --> 00:01:49.099
Song Ming's ambition was too obvious.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.420
Master Jin had long started
guarding against him.

00:01:51.552 --> 00:01:55.231
Because Song Ming wasn't satisfied
with just being mayor,

00:01:55.232 --> 00:01:59.112
he secretly went behind Jin's back
and got involved in the opium business.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.199
But tell me,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.120
do you really think Song Ming would be
satisfied with those petty gains?

00:02:05.872 --> 00:02:07.791
He's such a greedy man.

00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:08.791
So,

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:10.351
what he truly wants

00:02:10.352 --> 00:02:13.274
is definitely not that
empty "provincial chairman" title.

00:02:13.275 --> 00:02:15.111
Now that I'm helping him
as an opportunity,

00:02:15.112 --> 00:02:16.751
I can both earn his trust

00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:20.861
and find a way to discover
what exactly he's planning.

00:02:20.862 --> 00:02:22.271
Killing two birds with one stone.

00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:23.391
As expected of you, Boss.

00:02:23.392 --> 00:02:25.352
You always see things
more clearly than I do.

00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:30.871
And as for Madam Lin.

00:02:30.872 --> 00:02:32.351
If you hesitate like this,

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:33.952
you'll never win a girl's heart.

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:35.911
None of your business.

00:02:35.912 --> 00:02:37.032
Go to sleep.

00:02:40.672 --> 00:02:41.871
Looks like

00:02:41.872 --> 00:02:44.752
this strategist will have
to step in myself.

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:58.231
Madam.

00:02:58.232 --> 00:03:00.511
How was the food today?

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:01.471
Your cooking

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:03.992
rivals the chefs at Xianhe Restaurant.

00:03:10.152 --> 00:03:12.151
Madam Li, is there something
you want to tell me?

00:03:12.152 --> 00:03:13.472
No, nothing.

00:03:13.552 --> 00:03:15.272
Madam, you eat first.

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:26.874
I just suddenly felt a bit sorry
for Mr. Lin.

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:28.591
That child

00:03:28.592 --> 00:03:30.899
didn't have a father or mother
to love him.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.871
He had to fend for himself
at such a young age.

00:03:32.872 --> 00:03:34.951
He's suffered quite a lot.

00:03:34.952 --> 00:03:38.752
What he lacks most is someone
who cares for him.

00:03:42.232 --> 00:03:42.871
Madam.

00:03:42.872 --> 00:03:44.191
You might not know this,

00:03:44.192 --> 00:03:45.991
I used to run a wonton stall.

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:47.072
For a while,

00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:56.671
Mr. Lin is someone who's cold
on the outside but warm inside.

00:03:56.672 --> 00:04:00.631
These years, although he seems
successful on the surface,

00:04:00.632 --> 00:04:04.391
he's actually very lonely inside.

00:04:04.392 --> 00:04:07.031
- If only someone could accompany him...
- Madam Li.

00:04:07.032 --> 00:04:08.191
I'm done eating.

00:04:08.192 --> 00:04:09.791
Please clean up.

00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:10.591
Madam.

00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:11.911
I'm not finished talking yet.

00:04:11.912 --> 00:04:12.511
Madam.

00:04:12.512 --> 00:04:15.072
Have a few more bites, Madam.

00:04:23.912 --> 00:04:26.999
Hao, do you remember three years ago,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.631
when Boss charged alone

00:04:28.632 --> 00:04:30.436
into that human traffickers' hideout

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.872
to help Aunt Zhang next door
find her grandson?

00:04:33.352 --> 00:04:34.471
Of course I remember.

00:04:34.472 --> 00:04:35.674
How could I forget?

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:38.211
Boss went in alone.

00:04:38.212 --> 00:04:40.591
By the time we arrived,
he had already finished off everyone.

00:04:40.592 --> 00:04:42.432
Boss was even stabbed that time.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.461
Poor guy lay in bed

00:04:44.462 --> 00:04:45.831
for a whole week.

00:04:45.832 --> 00:04:47.711
Only then could he get out of bed.

00:04:47.712 --> 00:04:49.591
Good thing Boss has a strong body.

00:04:49.592 --> 00:04:50.391
Otherwise,

00:04:50.392 --> 00:04:52.474
17 stab wounds...

00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:53.711
If they'd been on me,

00:04:53.712 --> 00:04:55.152
I'd have died long ago.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.111
Biggie.

00:04:58.112 --> 00:04:59.386
Do you remember that incident?

00:04:59.387 --> 00:05:00.387
Which one?

00:05:03.872 --> 00:05:07.751
Otherwise he would've met
the King Yama.

00:05:07.752 --> 00:05:09.191
Who wouldn't say so?

00:05:09.192 --> 00:05:11.351
Boss has been fighting all these years,

00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:13.911
all relying on his sharp mind

00:05:13.912 --> 00:05:15.512
and exceptional skills.

00:05:20.272 --> 00:05:21.551
Madam Lin.

00:05:21.552 --> 00:05:22.992
- What a coincidence.
- Yeah.

00:05:24.552 --> 00:05:26.071
I told Madam

00:05:26.072 --> 00:05:28.751
that our boss is cold outside
but warm inside,

00:05:28.752 --> 00:05:30.151
brave and mighty.

00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:31.431
Madam believed everything.

00:05:31.432 --> 00:05:33.832
Mission overachieved.

00:05:34.072 --> 00:05:35.112
Not bad.

00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:38.471
Here, this is for you.

00:05:38.472 --> 00:05:40.352
Thank you, Liu.

00:05:42.352 --> 00:05:42.831
Liu.

00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:44.192
Look at this.

00:05:51.437 --> 00:05:52.671
What are you doing?

00:05:52.672 --> 00:05:54.071
Say something.

00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:56.472
What heroic deeds did you tell Madam Lin
about our boss?

00:05:57.192 --> 00:05:58.112
Cat got your tongue?

00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:02.911
Boss, Madam Lin.

00:06:02.912 --> 00:06:04.591
Why is it you two?

00:06:04.592 --> 00:06:05.712
It's okay.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.591
I just wanted to come take a look

00:06:07.592 --> 00:06:10.071
smart and quick-witted,
great at fighting,

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:12.991
Cold outside but warm inside,
yet lonely and without support,

00:06:12.992 --> 00:06:14.831
a lonely heart,

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:18.191
the pitiful yet admirable leader
of Chengyun Society, Mr. Lin Yun,

00:06:18.192 --> 00:06:20.312
what else don't I know?

00:06:21.412 --> 00:06:22.692
Don't laugh.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.072
Why are you laughing?

00:06:29.192 --> 00:06:30.871
I just realized

00:06:30.872 --> 00:06:32.552
you're quite humorous.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.431
Have you been too free lately?

00:06:37.432 --> 00:06:38.911
No, no.

00:06:38.912 --> 00:06:40.632
Come on, let's go.

00:06:50.432 --> 00:06:51.671
Sorry.

00:06:51.672 --> 00:06:53.072
I didn't know about this.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.089
I saw it last time
when I helped you apply medicine.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.057
All those knife wounds were
from the past few years.

00:07:02.992 --> 00:07:04.112
Does it still hurt?

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:06.345
It stopped hurting long ago.

00:07:06.952 --> 00:07:08.072
You...

00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:10.592
Feel sorry for me?

00:07:11.352 --> 00:07:12.472
I...

00:07:27.192 --> 00:07:28.311
So?

00:07:28.312 --> 00:07:29.752
My trick worked, right?

00:07:31.272 --> 00:07:33.192
What kind of gifts do women usually like?

00:07:34.372 --> 00:07:35.751
You finally asked the right person.

00:07:35.752 --> 00:07:37.152
Cut the crap, hurry up.

00:07:37.672 --> 00:07:39.351
Simply put, one sentence,

00:07:39.352 --> 00:07:40.711
only kids make choices.

00:07:40.712 --> 00:07:42.311
Adults

00:07:42.312 --> 00:07:43.432
want everything.

00:07:57.312 --> 00:07:58.512
How about this set?

00:07:59.592 --> 00:08:00.311
Looks good.

00:08:00.312 --> 00:08:02.552
You didn't even look
and you said it looks good.

00:08:04.592 --> 00:08:06.591
Much better than the previous one.

00:08:06.592 --> 00:08:08.551
No, Boss.

00:08:08.552 --> 00:08:11.299
What's the difference between the two?

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.340
See? That's why I say you
have no fashion sense.

00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:16.751
Boss.

00:08:16.752 --> 00:08:19.671
Do you have some important event today?

00:08:19.672 --> 00:08:20.751
No.

00:08:20.752 --> 00:08:22.712
Then you must be meeting
someone important.

00:08:24.592 --> 00:08:25.512
No.

00:08:27.437 --> 00:08:28.631
Boss.

00:08:28.632 --> 00:08:29.752
Boss.

00:08:30.432 --> 00:08:32.312
This one looks nice, try it on.

00:09:00.632 --> 00:09:01.752
Morning, darling.

00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:03.672
Morning.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:10.672
Liu Xiu made it.

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:14.872
I made it?

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:43.952
Thank you.

00:09:44.312 --> 00:09:45.312
You're welcome.

00:09:50.552 --> 00:09:51.431
Boss.

00:09:51.432 --> 00:09:54.392
You look like a peacock
showing off right now.

00:09:55.152 --> 00:09:56.312
Do I?

00:09:58.012 --> 00:09:59.071
Pretty handsome, actually.

00:09:59.072 --> 00:10:00.712
I'll walk myself.

00:10:06.832 --> 00:10:08.231
Where are you taking me?

00:10:08.232 --> 00:10:09.432
Shopping.

00:10:10.112 --> 00:10:11.432
Sit tight.

00:10:13.352 --> 00:10:14.472
Start the car.

00:10:23.752 --> 00:10:24.672
Boss.

00:10:25.712 --> 00:10:26.751
Sir, Madam, welcome.

00:10:26.752 --> 00:10:28.951
Bring out the best items in your shop.

00:10:28.952 --> 00:10:29.831
They're all here.

00:10:29.832 --> 00:10:31.591
Lin Yun, what are you trying to do?

00:10:31.592 --> 00:10:32.912
Buy you clothes.

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:34.591
The leader of Chengyun Society's woman

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:37.272
wearing those few shabby outfits
every day, so pathetic.

00:10:37.272 --> 00:10:38.720
I can't bring myself to show you off.

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:41.391
If you won't choose, I'll choose.

00:10:41.392 --> 00:10:42.751
Not this one, this one's out.

00:10:42.752 --> 00:10:43.431
The rest,

00:10:43.432 --> 00:10:44.631
according to her size,

00:10:44.632 --> 00:10:45.431
bring one of each.

00:10:45.432 --> 00:10:46.992
Alright, please wait.

00:10:52.462 --> 00:10:54.457

00:10:55.137 --> 00:10:57.357
(Linglong Pavilion Rouge Shop)

00:11:07.432 --> 00:11:09.552
Boss.

00:11:09.952 --> 00:11:11.752
We really can't buy any more.

00:11:11.792 --> 00:11:12.751
If we keep buying,

00:11:12.752 --> 00:11:14.592
I'm going to die.

00:11:14.712 --> 00:11:16.151
Then that's it for today.

00:11:16.152 --> 00:11:16.992
Let's go.

00:11:17.432 --> 00:11:18.952
I knew I shouldn't have talked so much.

00:11:23.992 --> 00:11:26.072
Hello, Boss, Madam.

00:11:29.792 --> 00:11:30.911
Mr. Lin is here again.

00:11:30.912 --> 00:11:32.552
Madam Lin didn't get drunk
this time, right?

00:11:33.992 --> 00:11:36.511
Today, everyone's Puyuan Pastries

00:11:36.512 --> 00:11:38.551
will be paid for by our boss.

00:11:38.552 --> 00:11:40.992
Thank you, Madam Lin.

00:11:44.672 --> 00:11:46.231
This is too much.

00:11:46.232 --> 00:11:47.191
Just take it.

00:11:47.192 --> 00:11:50.272
But this Puyuan Pastries must
stay open, understand?

00:11:51.575 --> 00:11:52.471
Pack two for me.

00:11:52.472 --> 00:11:53.512
Alright.

00:11:58.672 --> 00:11:59.751
Here.

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:00.872
Come often.

00:12:01.752 --> 00:12:02.552
Let's go.

00:12:02.952 --> 00:12:04.072
Where now?

00:12:05.232 --> 00:12:06.192
Xianhe Restaurant.

00:12:10.592 --> 00:12:12.872
Sending off Boss and Madam.

00:12:22.552 --> 00:12:24.552
Eat quickly, it won't taste good
when it gets cold.

00:12:27.552 --> 00:12:30.112
I don't know if these dishes
suit your taste.

00:12:31.352 --> 00:12:34.471
Lin Yun, can we talk?

00:12:34.472 --> 00:12:36.271
What's wrong?

00:12:36.272 --> 00:12:38.272
Is the food not good?

00:12:43.952 --> 00:12:45.672
All this today,

00:12:46.912 --> 00:12:48.231
what does it mean?

00:12:48.232 --> 00:12:50.231
What do you mean what does it mean?

00:12:50.232 --> 00:12:53.352
Is there a problem with me taking
my wife shopping?

00:12:58.272 --> 00:13:00.151
I'm not your wife.

00:13:00.152 --> 00:13:01.992
If you're not my wife, then who is?

00:13:07.592 --> 00:13:09.751
The one who married you was Xu Yin,

00:13:09.752 --> 00:13:11.472
not me.

00:13:13.952 --> 00:13:18.192
What does who you are have
to do with how I treat you?

00:13:19.872 --> 00:13:21.271
About the ledger,

00:13:21.272 --> 00:13:23.351
I would've done the same for anyone.

00:13:23.352 --> 00:13:25.392
I hope you won't misunderstand.

00:13:26.952 --> 00:13:29.472
I never had romantic feelings for you.

00:13:30.472 --> 00:13:31.591
From beginning to end,

00:13:31.592 --> 00:13:34.152
I've only been a woman
using someone else's identity.

00:13:34.287 --> 00:13:36.046
We agreed from the start.

00:13:36.047 --> 00:13:38.127
It was just a cooperation.

00:13:40.752 --> 00:13:42.391
Once I get my revenge,

00:13:42.392 --> 00:13:44.071
and you achieve your goal,

00:13:44.072 --> 00:13:47.032
there will be no ties left between us.

00:13:58.592 --> 00:14:00.392
I'm telling you this today

00:14:01.032 --> 00:14:03.072
because I don't want you
to fall too deep.
