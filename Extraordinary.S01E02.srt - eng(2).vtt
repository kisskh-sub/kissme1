00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.359
So heavy.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.000
It’s worth at least fifty.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.959
This pair, twenty.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:18.000
Not worth much, maybe ten.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.840
Wastrel.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.640
Truly a wastrel after all.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:30.439
Young Duke, Young Duke.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.120
Can’t sell.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.239
This one can’t be sold.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.719
If not this, what’s valuable left?

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.719
What the old emperor bestowed is valuable.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.480
This was bestowed by Emperor Taizong.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.239
Can’t sell, can’t sell.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.719
Someone, drag him away.

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.359
Young Duke, you can’t sell this.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.959
Drag him away.

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.680
Young Duke, Young Duke.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.680
Rare items are valuable, can’t sell.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.719
Young Duke.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.519
Young Duke.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.239
This pillow of yours is nice.

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:54.000
One of a kind.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.159
Soft and heavy.

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:57.920
This must be worth a lot.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.519
Such an important thing.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:01.640
If you sell it, what about me?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.599
Put it back where it came from.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.959
Come.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.480
Alright.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:06.159
Ping'an.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.319
Come with me to promote.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.639
Promote.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.960
Go shout in the street.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.400
No, no.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.240
Young Duke, we can’t go.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.240
The Duke warned you many times.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.039
You must stay in the mansion.

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.000
If you go out,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.159
what if something dangerous happens?

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.680
I couldn’t bear the blame.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.719
You’re right.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:27.360
See?

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.080
Then you go instead.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.039
Come.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.439
Don’t miss out as you pass by.

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.439
The Duke’s son is wasting money again.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.199
Yeah.

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.199
The Duke is such a good man.

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.879
How did he get such a spendthrift son?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.000
See, the wastrel is at it again.

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.159
Don’t miss out as you pass by.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.000
This son just eats, drinks, gambles, and loafs.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.319
He’ll ruin the family soon enough.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.039
Such a spendthrift.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.360
Wastrel.

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.319
So open and blatant.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.199
Few chances to get close to the Southern Duke’s Mansion.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:31.479
Vengeance for my family’s destruction.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.199
I’ll make their whole family pay.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.159
I’ll wait for the right moment.

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.520
I’ll aim for a single, fatal strike.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.960
Don’t miss out as you pass by.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.039
Don’t miss out as you pass by.

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.599
Young Duke, there’s no one here.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.240
Don’t miss out, Young Duke.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.599
Will anyone really come?

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:09.840
Don’t miss out as you pass by.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.240
Desires are endless in life.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.759
In this world of dust,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.560
someone is always chasing profit.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.920
Greedy for small gains.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.360
As long as our price is low and quality good,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.480
great value for money.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.279
People will rush to buy.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.879
Here they come.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.439
Over there.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.360
Pick whatever you like.

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:43.680
Everyone, come and see.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:46.720
Great quality, low price—come buy!

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.079
This is ten taels, that’s ten taels too.

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:52.600
Price drops, quality stays.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.040
You’ll find your favorite.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.079
Three items, forty percent off.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.279
Alright.

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.720
Take it slow.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:58.839
I want this—slow down!

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.199
Young Duke.

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:05.120
Slow down, slow down.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.920
Come, come.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.040
Pick and choose as you like.

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:08.959
All cheap.

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:11.079
Come, come.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.160
Let me introduce something special.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.560
The Southern Duke’s Mansion’s treasure.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.639
EMPEROR TAIZONG'S BESTOWED SWORD

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.480
Starting at ten thousand taels.

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:36.720
Very cheap.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.439
Want to try?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.199
Is your blade faster, or my sword?

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.920
I want this—wrap it up for me.

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:49.839
Young Duke, are you alright?

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:52.959
Just let him go like that?

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.560
Just a minor lackey.

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:55.639
Let him go.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.759
Son.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.439
This is what I wore in years of battle.

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:01.920
Gold-thread soft armor.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.639
Put it on.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.879
Handle the big matters first.

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.000
Come, everyone, take a look.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.639
Three for forty percent off, two for twenty.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.920
Useless.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.680
Get lost.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.319
Yes.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.879
Sent a useless fool.

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:26.519
This is your “foolproof” plan?

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:29.879
I know my mistake.

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:33.839
Yueying.

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:36.920
Been top courtesan at Cangxiang Pavilion too long.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.959
Really thinks she’s a flower now.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.680
With Star Pavilion backing her.

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.319
If I were you,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.439
Family vengeance, sword hatred.

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.319
I’d make him pay double.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.079
There’s something here after all.

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:44.360
Reporting to Your Majesty,

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:45.800
the Young Duke of the Shi family

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.879
keeps the princess by his side every day.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.079
It seems the princess has earned
the Duke's Mansion's trust.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.920
But someone is deliberately targeting
the Duke's Mansion.

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:56.800
This old servant worries

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:58.800
the princess might get involved.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.399
Send someone for close protection.

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:01.480
Yes.

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:05.000
I want to see how deep
the Duke's Mansion's secrets go.

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:10.160
Your Majesty,

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:11.879
what did the princess do wrong

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:14.040
to make you send her alone
to Detian Temple?

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:15.839
Zhi'er is thoughtful

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.680
and volunteered to pray for the people
on my behalf.

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:21.240
The princess, like Your Majesty,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.839
always thinks of the people.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:25.600
Unlike my disappointing nephew.

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:28.920
The Southern Duke can't supervise him,
he won't amount to much.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.320
Empress,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.559
look at this move I made in chess.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.440
Sacrifice the two pieces above,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.279
cross from the first line.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.080
Though the whole board

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.600
still looks bad for white,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.639
the lone piece survives.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:51.039
Your Majesty is feinting openly

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:52.399
while making a secret move.

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:10.240
What are you doing?

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:31.519
We're all men here.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:33.320
Who doesn't have a few collections?

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:36.600
Why such a big reaction?

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:39.759
Unless

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:42.960
you're not a man.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.720
I—I am a man!

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:48.480
Still pretending?

00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:50.480
I knew from the first day I met you.

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:52.000
Even if you wear men's clothes,

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:53.200
your voice,

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:55.240
and your scent,

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:57.240
most importantly,

00:09:57.759 --> 00:09:58.639
you have no beard,

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:01.720
and no Adam's apple.

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:05.120
I...

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:09.840
I just wanted a meal.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.080
I heard your mansion was hiring servants,

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.200
so I came.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.720
Just for that?

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.559
Young Duke,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.320
I had no choice.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.600
Those people, for money,

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.120
would do anything.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.720
They even wanted to send me
to a brothel.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.519
Alright, alright.

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:28.159
Young Duke,

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.240
if you want to stay here,

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:39.480
you must behave yourself.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.279
Young Duke,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.039
what's your name?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:45.960
Zhi'er.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.159
Zhi'er.

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:49.639
Isn't Zhi'er a girl's name?

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.960
Everything's sold out.

00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:54.440
Sold out.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.279
Young Duke, you're truly wise.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:58.080
Even the stone lions at the gate
were sold.

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:00.600
But the accountant

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:01.960
was dismissed long ago.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.279
No one here knows accounting.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:07.799
I'll do it.

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:20.120
Find the best craftsman in the capital

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.840
to make these parts.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.639
Also,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.639
go to the imperial fireworks shop

00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:25.840
and buy some black powder.

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:27.000
Young Duke,

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:28.279
what's this for?

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:29.480
You'll know soon.

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:30.360
Alright, alright.

00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:31.720
Remember,

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:32.960
keep it secret.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:39.799
Let's begin.

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:51.440
Zhi'er,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.279
record the buyers' information too.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.440
Young Duke,

00:11:55.759 --> 00:11:57.480
why record the buyers' info?

00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:00.480
Shi family's things

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.759
will eventually return to the Shi family.

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:11.159
Your handwriting is bold and strong,

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.799
but too slow.

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:14.559
Zhi'er,

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:16.279
stand up.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.919
This is messy and crowded.

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:31.559
One hundred seventy-five.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.039
It should be written like this.

00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:37.679
These three squiggles

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.600
can mean one hundred seventy-five.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.960
What squiggles?

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.799
These are Arabic numerals.

00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:44.720
Arabic?

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.679
Is that someone's name?

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:48.960
Alright, alright.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.399
It's done.

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:00.440
All calculated.

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:01.519
Young Duke,

00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:03.559
you're faster than the accountant.

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:07.360
This silver

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.200
is almost enough.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.080
Enough for what?

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:14.799
You'll know soon.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.039
Zhi'er,

00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:18.679
stay and watch the house.

00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:20.759
Ping'an, come with me.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.480
They all say you're a wastrel,

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:28.480
but it seems

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.720
you're not useless after all.

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:33.679
You'd better not go.

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:36.039
No, the Duke ordered me

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.039
to stay by your side at all times.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.519
Brother,

00:13:39.679 --> 00:13:41.320
what could happen in broad daylight?

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.320
Besides,

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:46.080
your main task is

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.720
to watch her.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.399
Don't let her notice.

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:53.080
Let's go.

00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:00.360
Boss,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.799
the Young Duke is here.

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:04.919
This silk is 1,500 coins per bolt.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.440
I'll take as many as you have.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.759
Anyone you refer to sell cloth

00:14:09.399 --> 00:14:10.679
just mention your name

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.799
and get a 1% rebate.

00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:14.320
Rebate?

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:15.799
Don't underestimate 1%—

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.399
the more cloth, the more rebate.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:21.960
Deal.
