00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:03.560
General Gan,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.560
I have something you want.

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.280
Beijiang's defense map.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.280
In exchange, take me back to the capital.

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:26.479
I wonder

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.759
what you plan to do

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.680
once you return?

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.280
Liu Zhen framed me.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.319
The royal family abandoned me.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.599
I will throw them into chaos

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.000
and make them repay

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:45.960
whatever they owe me.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.759
Good.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.759
Very good.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.800
I'll take you back to the capital.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.680
The hundred thousand cavalry behind me
will be your backing.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.560
But I have one more condition.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.800
I want you

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:13.360
to marry me.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.039
I need your status as the Princess Royal

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.960
to weaken the ministers' power,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.479
so I can rightfully claim Jing as mine.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.599
Of course I remember.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.000
But don't forget what we agreed on.

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.240
Only after you wipe out
Liu Zhen and his faction

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.759
and bring all the armies
under our control

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.199
will we marry.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.350
Your Highness,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.400
you asked me to find Mr. Qingya.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:12.960
There's no news yet.

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:20.720
It's all thanks to him

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.360
that I could come back alive.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.519
You must find him.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.430
Yes, Your Highness.

How was it?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.839
Your Highness, I didn't mean
to defy your order.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:01.959
But I truly

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.759
can't write a word.

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.319
Why?

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.800
You could write five years ago,
and you can't now?

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.020
Official Li, have you forgotten

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.079
how you held my hand

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.519
and taught me to write

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:25.199
five years ago?

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:29.240
'Nian'.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.720
It means faith.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.360
"Present"

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:36.759
and "heart"

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.850
formed the character for "faith".

you could write so well without me.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.590

is thanks to you, Official Li.

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:12.519
You taught me a hard lesson.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.759
Heaven and earth can be measured,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.890
but you can't get the measure
of the human heart.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.439
In this world,

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:21.399

With these very hands,

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:35.560
you wrote the memorial that sent me away
for the marriage alliance.

Li Yuanze,

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:40.959
tell me.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.439
On the day I was sent off,

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:46.319
why didn't you come?

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.120
Stop right there.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.480
Yuanze,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.120
where are you going?

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.279
I'm going to see His Majesty.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:07.199
I'll tell him the memorial
wasn't written by me.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.040
It shouldn't count.

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:11.360
You can't go.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.759
Why not?

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.879
Sir,

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:19.600
you submitted that memorial

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:21.079
in my name,

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:22.839
and drugged my food

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.240
so I slept through the day,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.639
causing me to miss my last chance.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.519
Because of all this,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.840
a marriage alliance
can bring a truce to Beijiang.

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:35.000
This is the Emperor's choice.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.360
He needs a proper reason.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.990
In the entire imperial court,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.759
you're the only one
who knows her,

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.080
and you have a clean reputation.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.360
What you think doesn't matter.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.120
What matters is that His Majesty
needs that memorial.

00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:49.399
And more importantly,

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:52.320
Jing needs time to catch its breath.

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:56.039
Then let my life be the exchange!

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.240
I'd rather be executed

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:00.440
than let her make the sacrifice alone.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.080
It's too late.

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:06.639
You, me, and the Princess Royal

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:09.519
are nothing but His Majesty's pawns.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.120
Since we are pawns,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.279
how could we ever decide our own fate?

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.720
I...

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:53.759
Since you refuse to tell,

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:55.399
