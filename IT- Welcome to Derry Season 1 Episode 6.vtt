00:35.660 --> 00:36.995
I don't want to go.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.582
There's nothing
to be afraid of down there.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.126
Come on.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.587
Good girl.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.009
What's your name, dear?

00:52.635 --> 00:53.762
Mabel.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.656
So, Mabel...

01:15.200 --> 01:17.368
this is where the clown told you
to meet him?

01:19.537 --> 01:20.955
You can tell me.

01:50.985 --> 01:54.239
It's okay. Sweetheart, it's okay.
It's just a balloon.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.951
Duck and cover, kiddos.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.413
What you don't understand is,
I could have killed you down there.

04:08.498 --> 04:12.293
But instead, I had to send
my best friend home in a box.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.380
Because you disobeyed me.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.884
Come on, Dad. That's not fair.
You know what killed Uncle Pauly.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.845
What I know is I have a son
that has no goddamn sense.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.764
-Okay, Leroy.
-Charlotte, I'm sorry.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.975
You have to stay out of this.
You were not there.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.394
This thing could change its shape.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.396
Like, it could see inside my head.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.023
-How is that possible, Lee?
-I don't know.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.401
But I do know these weren't mind games.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.236
This was real. This was solid.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.822
-It killed trained soldiers.
-Dad, I know what it can do.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.492
It's come after us a bunch of times,
and it's not gonna stop.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.327
Well, it can't touch you out here.
Outside of Derry.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.622
So, from now on, you don't leave your room
without my permission.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.165
Do you understand?

04:52.417 --> 04:53.501
No.

04:53.584 --> 04:56.254
-No--
-Baby, mind your daddy now.

04:58.673 --> 05:02.927
No! You always told me
that a man should never hide from trouble.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.054
That what makes life count
are the friends you make

05:05.138 --> 05:08.099
and the risks you take.
Well, I've got friends now, Dad.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.434
I've got friends and they need me,

05:09.517 --> 05:11.394
and I'm gonna be there for them,
just like you would.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.646
You are not me.

05:14.147 --> 05:18.026
Yeah, I know that. I know I'm not you
'cause I would never let my friends die.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.445
Leroy!

05:30.163 --> 05:32.623
-I'm sorry, son.
-It's gotten to you too.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.460
-It's gotten to your head.
-No.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.880
-Come here, son.
-Get away from me!

07:07.802 --> 07:09.011
What is that?

07:09.095 --> 07:11.639
It was under the water
when the clown was coming after me.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.059
It started to glow, and...

07:15.601 --> 07:17.562
and he looked at it almost like...

07:18.187 --> 07:19.730
like he was afraid.

07:20.815 --> 07:23.067
Afraid? Really?

07:23.776 --> 07:24.777
Yeah.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.572
Then he backed away and just...

07:28.781 --> 07:29.907
disappeared.

07:33.034 --> 07:34.203
Can I see?

07:35.455 --> 07:36.622
I'll hold it.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.750
Fine.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.048
-They look like hieroglyphs.
-I thought those were Egyptian.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.427
All ancient civilizations
have hieroglyphs. It's a Greek word.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.012
Exactly.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.557
Whatever it is,
if this thing is scared of it,

07:54.640 --> 07:55.975
maybe we can use it.

07:57.058 --> 08:00.605
We go back down there,
all of us together...

08:01.981 --> 08:03.107
and we kill it.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.071
You really expect us to listen to you?

08:09.155 --> 08:12.533
You're the one who dragged us down there
in the first damn place.

08:13.117 --> 08:16.496
We almost died.
And now you want us to go back?

08:17.788 --> 08:19.415
You are crazy.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.584
What did you call me?

08:26.255 --> 08:27.548
Lilly?

08:27.632 --> 08:29.258
-Just give it--
-Don't touch it!

08:33.846 --> 08:35.389
You think I wanted this?

08:36.474 --> 08:39.769
If I could go back, I'd never have gone
to your house in the first place.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.438
You were up in the booth. You didn't see.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.358
I was the only one who made it
out of that theater.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.818
And for Matty to come back and tell us
there was a chance that

08:47.902 --> 08:49.195
Phil was still alive?

08:49.278 --> 08:50.905
What was I supposed to do?

08:50.988 --> 08:53.699
If you hadn't come to my house that day,

08:53.783 --> 08:55.701
they probably would still be alive.

08:55.785 --> 08:59.205
And the cops wouldn't be
hunting my daddy like some kind of animal.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.415
All I wanted was to help you.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.211
A lot of good it did.
I wish I never tried.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.921
-Guys--
-And I wish I'd never met you,

09:07.004 --> 09:08.839
-Lilly Bainbridge!
-Can't you see?

09:09.465 --> 09:12.385
This is what it wants!
To turn us against each other.

09:12.468 --> 09:16.055
They should have never
let you out of Juniper Hill!

09:21.852 --> 09:23.187
I'll go make sure she's okay.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.237
-She didn't mean that.
-Don't.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.533
Just... Just leave me alone.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.064
Hallorann? Where you been?

10:07.648 --> 10:08.649
Can't tell you.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.277
Okay. Place looks good, huh?

10:11.360 --> 10:13.487
Yeah, we're gonna get something going
later tomorrow night,

10:13.571 --> 10:16.198
bring some ladies, some music,
break this place in.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.076
Yeah, it's gonna be a real good time.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.790
Shit.

10:27.376 --> 10:28.419
You need this?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.546
More than you know.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.350
You good?

10:43.559 --> 10:44.560
Yeah.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.815
Fuckin' ice box leakin'.
Need to replace that.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.525
Floorboard is rottin'.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.281
I'm gonna polish off this bottle of Pap,

10:57.365 --> 10:59.825
catch myself a couple Z's in the back.

10:59.909 --> 11:00.951
You can't.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.121
We got something we gotta talk about.

11:09.710 --> 11:10.711
Tell me.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.713
Can you believe her?
It's like she won't stop

11:12.797 --> 11:13.964
until one of us is dead.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.758
We barely made it
out of those tunnels alive,

11:15.841 --> 11:17.843
and now she's trying
to serve us up to that thing again?

11:17.927 --> 11:19.261
She must have snapped her cap!

11:19.887 --> 11:21.180
You agree with me, right?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.182
Yeah. Definitely.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.935
You think I went too far?

11:26.560 --> 11:27.895
I mean...

11:28.521 --> 11:29.897
Maybe I did, but...

11:33.567 --> 11:34.819
I'm just tired.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.613
I'm tired of being scared.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.200
I know.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.703
Me too.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.355
William Dubois Hanlon?

12:12.022 --> 12:14.358
Get your disobedient behind
in this car right now.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.610
Dubois?

12:19.071 --> 12:20.406
You too, little miss.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.533
Me? Why?

12:24.785 --> 12:26.579
Y'all think y'all grown?

12:41.385 --> 12:43.220
-Shit.
-Are you--

12:43.304 --> 12:45.389
-Is that who the fuck I think that is?
-Yeah, but--

12:45.473 --> 12:47.141
They got posters of the man
all over town, Reggie.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.477
They got rewards
for this man and everything.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.228
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.063
-Please, I-- I-- Please.
-No, no, no. No. No!

12:53.147 --> 12:54.982
Mrs. Hanlon asked
if we could hide him here.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.317
What was I supposed to say?

12:56.400 --> 12:59.236
I think that you are inviting
a whole lot of hurt up in here.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.447
She says she's got
a plan to get him out of town.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.115
Just needs a couple days
to get it all straight.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.534
Like, what do you expect me to do?
Turn him over to some lynch mob?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.203
Look, I'll-- I'll stay out of sight.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.079
I'll stay out of sight.
I-- I-- I promise, sir.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.248
I won't leave this room. Please.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.292
Please.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.753
I don't need this shit right now.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.592
Where is he? Daddy?

13:21.675 --> 13:22.802
-Ronnie?
-Daddy!

13:22.885 --> 13:24.595
Ronnie! Ronnie!

13:24.678 --> 13:26.806
-Daddy!
-Oh God! Oh God!

13:29.183 --> 13:30.267
Baby.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.854
I missed you! Let me look at you.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.524
-You okay? Let me see you.
-I missed you.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.526
-I missed you so much.
-I missed you too.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.653
We've been looking for you everywhere.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.780
It's all right, baby.
No one knows about this place.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.324
Just a few colored airmen from the base.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.662
I'm so sorry.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.289
-I'm sorry I left you.
-Hey.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.333
Thank you for doing this.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.252
Leave me out of this.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.254
I'm so sorry.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.006
How'd they find you?

14:01.090 --> 14:04.009
A friend of mine reached out
to Mrs. Hanlon for me.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.345
-Who?
-It's a long story, baby.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.724
What's important is that we're together
and we're gonna stay together.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.602
Ain't no one gonna
keep us apart ever again.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.813
Ever again, okay?

14:15.896 --> 14:18.399
Yeah, let 'em try. Okay?

14:20.150 --> 14:22.444
I missed you. I missed you.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.822
You wanna talk about
what happened this morning?

14:24.905 --> 14:27.533
I'm here for you. I got you.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.744
My baby girl.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.788
It's gonna be all right.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.001
You're safe. You're safe, okay?

14:37.084 --> 14:41.463
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, baby.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.695
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.617
-You scared me.
-Sorry.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.036
I didn't think anybody would be here.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.290
-What are you doing here?
-Still haven't landed one on Main Street.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.502
-Want to try?
-I have to redress my eye.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.839
-The tape is hard to take off.
-Want some help?

15:23.923 --> 15:26.050
I was a Webelo for a couple years.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.887
I know the trick to taking a bandage off
without it hurting.

15:30.679 --> 15:31.931
It's really gross.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.659
What are you doing?

15:51.742 --> 15:53.827
What? If you wet it a little,
it'll slide right off.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.205
-Not with your spit.
-It's fine.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.540
Saliva actually has antiseptic properties.

15:59.165 --> 16:01.168
-I don't think that's true.
-Who knows?

16:01.710 --> 16:04.713
Science is constantly changing.
That's what Will says.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.256
You should hear him talk about it.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.307
See? Easy...

16:16.767 --> 16:18.018
peasy.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.525
It's awful, isn't it?

16:26.026 --> 16:28.278
No, it's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.206
I can handle it from here. Thanks.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.299
That was crazy before, huh?

16:49.883 --> 16:52.344
Lilly and Ronnie really
went at each other.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.554
Yeah.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.018
Yeah, I just...

17:00.394 --> 17:02.146
I just get a bad feeling. Like...

17:03.230 --> 17:04.732
this thing's not done with us.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.818
And if we have to face it alone, then...

17:09.528 --> 17:10.570
I know.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.781
What if Lilly's right?

17:15.492 --> 17:16.868
About that thing she found?

17:17.536 --> 17:19.913
What if it really is
the only way we can stop this?

17:21.415 --> 17:24.167
Don't we have a better chance
if we're together?

17:29.965 --> 17:31.675
I'm not the one who needs convincing.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.802
And Ronnie seems stubborn.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.602
I got it.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.162
Here goes nothing.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.003
Shit!

18:51.004 --> 18:52.923
Hallorann, are you in there?

19:03.934 --> 19:05.060
Major.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.985
Where you been?

19:14.903 --> 19:16.155
You need a drink?

19:18.115 --> 19:20.409
Drink. Drink, drink, drink.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.290
New orders from Shaw.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.501
Dead soldiers or not, he's still
on the hunt for those pillars.

19:30.627 --> 19:32.129
Makes sense.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.673
But if I was Shaw, I would stop
that shit before he f--

19:49.897 --> 19:51.648
I'll fuckin' look at it later.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.068
Dick, what happened down there?

19:58.071 --> 19:59.656
I think we pissed it off.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.991
I meant you.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.620
You stayed in those tunnels for hours.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.205
What happened?

20:08.749 --> 20:09.917
This thing I got...

20:11.210 --> 20:14.296
when I was little, let me see things.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.340
Okay.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.842
What kind of things?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.345
Dead ones.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.312
My grandma had some of what I got.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.899
Not as strong, but she had some, so...

20:35.651 --> 20:38.237
she realized I wasn't sleeping, and why,

20:38.320 --> 20:40.989
and she taught me this trick. Told me...

20:42.241 --> 20:45.535
Said, "Dick,
think of a great big ol' box."

20:46.411 --> 20:48.538
"And imagine putting all the things

20:48.622 --> 20:52.376
you don't want to see no more
inside the box. Closing it up."

20:53.377 --> 20:54.544
So I did.

20:56.171 --> 20:58.006
I took all them dead things,

20:58.924 --> 21:01.093
threw them in that box in my mind,

21:01.176 --> 21:03.804
and I shoved that goddamn lid on tight.

21:05.889 --> 21:07.099
I was nine.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.810
I ain't seen them since.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.604
'Til yesterday...

21:14.398 --> 21:16.191
when that goddamn thing...

21:17.693 --> 21:22.197
It forced itself into my head,
ripped that lid off,

21:23.448 --> 21:26.702
and laughed as it all came spillin' out.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.802
Are they here now?

21:47.014 --> 21:48.140
Can you see them?

21:52.978 --> 21:55.689
My grandma, she used to tell me that

21:57.274 --> 22:01.028
the dead, they always wander back
to where they died.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.281
Look like one or two of 'em
met their maker right here.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.534
Do they talk to you?

22:09.411 --> 22:10.704
No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:10.787 --> 22:13.623
Long as I don't regard them,
they don't even notice I'm here.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.917
But, man, if I open my mouth...

22:19.087 --> 22:21.006
the voices, they don't ever stop.

22:22.382 --> 22:27.512
And they know things, things we don't.
Things the living aren't meant to know.

22:29.890 --> 22:30.974
Like what?

22:37.814 --> 22:39.566
Like how to find what we're looking for?

22:43.028 --> 22:44.529
Did you hear a word I just said?

22:45.155 --> 22:49.076
Look... I just buried my wingman.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.622
Okay, my best friend.
And I almost killed my own son.

22:54.122 --> 22:57.250
So, no disrespect,
but we both got skin in the game.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.878
And I know it's asking a lot,
but at the end of the day,

22:59.961 --> 23:03.090
you're an airman first class
of the United States military.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.883
When shit gets real, it's the job.

23:06.009 --> 23:08.804
If this helps complete the mission,
just do it this one time,

23:08.887 --> 23:11.223
and then you can-- you can

23:12.140 --> 23:14.768
put it all back away,
just like it was before.

23:14.851 --> 23:18.772
Okay, so what-- what happens
if I can't shove it all away like before?

23:20.732 --> 23:22.734
You don't know. You don't know, do you?

23:24.069 --> 23:27.364
Or you don't give a fuck. Either way,
all this shit is about what you want.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.867
-It's about doing what's right.
-Get the fuck out of here with that.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.202
You know what? Shaw's calling,

23:32.285 --> 23:34.996
needs his boot shined,
you fuckin' bootlicker.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.290
Man, you don't talk to me like that.
I'm your superior officer.

23:37.374 --> 23:40.585
I don't give a fuck! Get out!

23:42.379 --> 23:43.755
Get out!

23:57.769 --> 24:00.647
Now you think about
whether you want to do your sworn duty,

24:00.730 --> 24:02.691
or get dragged out of here in handcuffs.

24:04.609 --> 24:05.694
Get some rest.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.626
Charlotte.

24:27.799 --> 24:28.967
Char?

24:35.348 --> 24:38.268
What's going on? Where's Will?

24:39.227 --> 24:40.812
Probably with his friends,

24:41.563 --> 24:44.107
who are about the only people
he can trust right now.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.485
And you know what? I don't blame him.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.988
-Okay, hold on a minute.
-No, you hold on a minute.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.241
You put hands on our boy.

24:53.783 --> 24:54.868
I know.

24:56.203 --> 24:59.039
And I'm sorry, Char, but you know that--
that wasn't me.

24:59.956 --> 25:02.250
It wasn't. My head was just...

25:03.543 --> 25:04.961
It was all messed up

25:05.045 --> 25:06.838
because of what happened
down in that sewer.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.259
And what happened to Pauly.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.185
I'm sorry.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.650
I'm sorry, Char.

25:27.817 --> 25:31.404
I'm just... trying to protect
this goddamn country.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.367
-This country?
-What?

25:35.450 --> 25:38.203
You put us in a cage
with a goddamn monster!

25:38.286 --> 25:39.788
I didn't know.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.083
I didn't know that.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.418
-Yeah, well, there's a lot you don't know.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.212
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

25:48.838 --> 25:50.674
Hank Grogan's at the Black Spot.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.177
-How'd he wind up there, Charlotte?
-I put him there.

25:54.261 --> 25:55.303
You--

25:57.722 --> 26:01.393
Yell, scream, stomp,
do whatever it is you need to do,

26:01.476 --> 26:02.852
won't make a lick of difference.

26:02.936 --> 26:05.981
Tomorrow morning,
I'm getting him out of town. Safe.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.024
And then Will and I are
headed back to Shreveport

26:08.108 --> 26:09.192
with or without you.

26:09.276 --> 26:12.153
I have a mission to finish, Charlotte.
I can't just walk away from that.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.446
Well, then I guess you'll join us

26:13.530 --> 26:15.490
when you can find the time
to make things right.

26:15.532 --> 26:16.908
Can't you see that's what I'm trying

26:16.992 --> 26:18.410
-to do here?
-Not with me.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.579
With your son.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.731
You convinced everyone to come and see me.

26:49.899 --> 26:53.403
Because you're such a good friend.

26:53.486 --> 26:57.240
But such a bad daughter!

26:57.324 --> 27:00.160
If you'd all take out your textbooks
and turn to page 61.

27:04.414 --> 27:09.210
Okay, so Sally has
2X the number of apples.

27:10.879 --> 27:14.591
Who's gonna help you now, crazy?

27:18.178 --> 27:20.722
You'll die if you try!

27:21.514 --> 27:23.016
Stay away!

27:26.978 --> 27:28.438
Lilly Bainbridge!

27:30.273 --> 27:31.983
Sit back down this very instant!

27:43.662 --> 27:45.830
Where do you think
you're going, young lady?

27:50.085 --> 27:52.045
Her dad? Are you serious?

27:52.128 --> 27:53.463
That's why she's not here.

27:53.546 --> 27:55.131
Will said his mom
took 'em there yesterday,

27:55.215 --> 27:56.883
and Ronnie hasn't left his side since.

27:57.425 --> 28:00.220
He said he'll take us there later,
but we can't tell anyone.

28:01.262 --> 28:04.516
-You think we can change her mind?
-I don't know. We gotta try.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.643
I could barely sleep last night.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.937
When I brushed my teeth,
I thought I heard voices

28:09.020 --> 28:10.897
-in the pipes.
-Voices in the pipes?

28:10.980 --> 28:11.981
You too?

28:12.232 --> 28:14.067
I wouldn't even go in there to pee.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.611
So what, you just held it in?

28:16.695 --> 28:19.531
Are you kidding?
I couldn't even do that if I tried.

28:19.614 --> 28:20.865
I just put it--

28:23.326 --> 28:25.286
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.540
Come on. Please. You're the only person

28:28.623 --> 28:30.458
I've shown my oozing eye scab to.

28:33.002 --> 28:34.003
Fine.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.842
I put a jar next to my bed,
and I emptied it this morning.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.724
In medieval times,
they called it a chamber pot.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.767
Everyone peed in them, even knights.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.436
Knights? Cool.

28:49.519 --> 28:52.355
They also fought in duels
and rescued fair maidens.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.192
Hey, I got you something.

28:59.779 --> 29:00.822
Here it is.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.616
Dug it out of my attic.

29:04.242 --> 29:07.996
Supposedly, it belonged to a corsair
my ancestors knew back in Cuba.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.123
I figured, I don't know,
you might like it.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.762
I love it.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.932
I've always wanted to be a pirate.

29:28.475 --> 29:31.519
Look at us. A pirate and a knight.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.813
Guess we got next Halloween
all figured out, huh?

29:33.897 --> 29:35.690
It's a date.

29:37.233 --> 29:38.943
No, I know.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.112
-I didn't mean to say--
-I didn't-- I didn't think you meant--

29:41.738 --> 29:42.822
Sorry.

29:45.241 --> 29:47.577
Hey, Margie. If I didn't know any better,

29:47.660 --> 29:49.245
I'd think you were avoiding us.

29:49.329 --> 29:50.872
Hi, Patty.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.957
Everyone's still talking
about how you escaped

29:53.041 --> 29:54.167
the jaws of death.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.086
At least Loony Lilly didn't
stab both your eyes out.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.130
That's not what happened.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.633
Well, why don't you tell us
about it over lunch?

30:02.550 --> 30:03.551
At our table.

30:06.304 --> 30:09.265
Unless you'd rather stay here
with Ricky Ricardo and the other freaks.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.075
Patty?

30:27.784 --> 30:28.827
Margaret?

30:30.495 --> 30:31.830
I am a freak.

30:36.042 --> 30:37.043
Stop!

30:37.836 --> 30:40.964
Rhon? Oh my God, Rhonda.
Just breathe! Oh my God!

31:05.572 --> 31:06.614
How much further?

31:07.991 --> 31:09.367
Almost there, I think.

31:14.247 --> 31:15.707
Will! Wait up!

31:19.836 --> 31:21.129
This is it.

31:21.254 --> 31:23.214
Now we gotta convince Ronnie
we have to stick together

31:23.298 --> 31:24.465
to fight this thing.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.719
Quick question. What if she says no?

31:28.803 --> 31:31.764
-Say a prayer she doesn't.
-I don't know, man.

31:31.848 --> 31:35.310
Last time I said a prayer,
my dead tío almost killed us.

31:35.476 --> 31:38.563
Okay, well... no prayers then.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.189
Oh, Lord.

31:49.824 --> 31:51.075
What is this place?

31:52.243 --> 31:54.495
It's like a clubhouse for some
of the airmen from the base.

31:54.996 --> 31:58.166
So kind of like the Standpipe,
but for grownups.

32:08.635 --> 32:09.677
Who is it?

32:10.970 --> 32:12.263
It's Will.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.891
Rich. Come on.

32:55.473 --> 32:56.599
Hello?

33:13.700 --> 33:14.909
Mrs. Kersh?

34:48.628 --> 34:50.045
Lilly?

34:51.339 --> 34:52.924
What are you doing up here?

34:53.757 --> 34:55.802
The door was open.

34:56.928 --> 35:01.307
It's fine.
I just wasn't expecting anybody.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.101
Are you okay?

35:04.268 --> 35:06.646
I'm all right. It's just...

35:07.563 --> 35:10.691
Well, we went down to the tunnels and--

35:10.775 --> 35:12.401
Lilly...

35:13.069 --> 35:15.738
-I begged you not to go.
-We didn't have a choice.

35:16.823 --> 35:17.949
And Matty...

35:19.075 --> 35:20.576
Matty, he...

35:26.040 --> 35:27.250
Darling.

35:31.462 --> 35:32.713
It's all right.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.967
It's okay. Whatever it is,
it's all going to be okay.

35:36.050 --> 35:38.386
I just-- I didn't know who else to go to.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.890
You're in the right place. All right?

35:43.975 --> 35:45.810
It's okay.

35:46.519 --> 35:47.645
It's okay.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.400
There, there.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.865
Lilly, you're safe here with me.

36:04.704 --> 36:07.290
Lilly, what's the matter?

36:15.298 --> 36:16.424
Have you seen him?

36:20.928 --> 36:22.013
You saw him.

36:24.473 --> 36:27.852
Oh, my word. You did it.

36:29.270 --> 36:32.064
Sweetheart, you did it. You did it.

36:34.108 --> 36:36.986
Lilly, of course, it was you.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.698
This is... I know you don't understand,

36:40.781 --> 36:43.367
but you brought him back.

36:46.996 --> 36:49.498
It's my old costume.

36:56.797 --> 36:58.299
You followed us?

36:59.258 --> 37:01.552
Yes. Yes.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.889
I thought he might appear
that night in the cemetery.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.849
You kids were on your bikes,

37:06.933 --> 37:09.477
and I was worried I might miss him

37:09.560 --> 37:11.729
if he showed himself to you.

37:12.438 --> 37:13.648
So that was you.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.404
But why?

37:30.706 --> 37:33.542
My father was a carnival performer.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.296
He called himself
"Pennywise the Dancing Clown."

37:38.673 --> 37:40.591
I adored him.

37:42.176 --> 37:43.844
And he was taken from me.

37:46.347 --> 37:48.724
The carnival moved on,
but I stayed in Derry.

37:50.434 --> 37:54.230
I suppose you could say I felt... drawn.

38:08.244 --> 38:09.870
Your parents are very concerned.

38:10.371 --> 38:14.333
They don't believe me... about Pennywise.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.883
He says he wants to show me his carnival.

38:24.844 --> 38:28.472
He's here in the pipes.

38:29.473 --> 38:32.601
He tells me to come down
to the basement at night.

38:32.685 --> 38:35.146
There are no such things
as clowns in pipes.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.274
Clowns live at the circus.

38:40.568 --> 38:41.736
Good girl.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.256
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay. It's just a balloon.

39:27.239 --> 39:28.366
Hello, Mabel.

39:32.453 --> 39:35.456
You finally came.

39:48.135 --> 39:50.721
And you brought a friend.

39:53.349 --> 39:54.558
Papa?

40:07.071 --> 40:08.197
Don't look back!

40:09.949 --> 40:11.367
There, Mabel!

40:21.794 --> 40:25.047
-Help!
-I'm trying! It's stuck!

40:25.131 --> 40:26.632
Please, open the door!

40:28.259 --> 40:29.885
Open the door!

40:30.886 --> 40:32.012
Oh God! No!

40:32.596 --> 40:35.391
Leave her alone! No, please! Please!

40:40.312 --> 40:41.522
Mabel--

40:59.498 --> 41:00.708
No!

41:45.836 --> 41:50.257
Pumpkin, it's me, Papa.

41:56.514 --> 42:01.894
How I've missed you all these years.

42:04.605 --> 42:06.649
No, no, don't be scared.

42:08.567 --> 42:10.319
I can explain everything.

42:12.321 --> 42:15.115
Just open the door and let me in.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.252
That's right.

42:27.670 --> 42:28.796
Open it.

42:30.297 --> 42:31.507
Let me in.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.928
Everything's gonna be all right.

42:47.064 --> 42:48.232
It was him.

42:50.109 --> 42:52.152
Different, perhaps changed

42:52.236 --> 42:55.781
by whatever he'd been through,
or wherever he'd been.

42:56.824 --> 42:59.076
But it was him all the same.

43:00.661 --> 43:02.079
A daughter knows.

43:05.541 --> 43:06.584
And...

43:07.876 --> 43:09.253
suddenly I...

43:11.088 --> 43:12.923
I felt whole again

43:13.007 --> 43:16.594
for the first time since that awful day.

43:20.889 --> 43:22.683
But every time that he would return,

43:23.309 --> 43:27.229
this shadow would steal my father away.

43:29.148 --> 43:32.860
I... I had to find a way to free him.

43:34.820 --> 43:37.239
So I did what I had to to see him again.

43:46.582 --> 43:49.668
If he could just see me
once more as his Periwinkle,

43:50.794 --> 43:52.796
remind him of the love that we shared,

43:54.214 --> 43:57.343
I know that he'll be able to break free.

44:00.387 --> 44:01.597
Please don't hurt me.

44:03.432 --> 44:04.558
Hurt you?

44:05.809 --> 44:08.979
I would never let anything hurt you.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.023
And my friends?

44:13.233 --> 44:14.318
Lilly...

44:15.694 --> 44:18.989
you above all people should understand.

44:25.204 --> 44:28.749
If you could see
your father again, hold him,

44:29.958 --> 44:31.293
be his little girl...

44:32.961 --> 44:36.090
wouldn't you do everything
you could to make that happen?

44:39.259 --> 44:41.220
My father is dead.

44:42.221 --> 44:44.473
You know what they say
about Derry, dear.

44:46.266 --> 44:48.727
No one who dies here ever really dies.

44:50.813 --> 44:52.439
Come with me tonight.

44:53.315 --> 44:54.358
Let me show you.

44:56.193 --> 44:57.236
Lilly!

45:10.791 --> 45:13.919
If we're gonna go after this thing,
it needs to be all of us.

45:14.962 --> 45:17.506
I'm not going anywhere
until I know my dad is safe.

45:17.589 --> 45:21.427
Hey, your dad, he's gonna be fine.
Nobody knows that he's here.

45:22.845 --> 45:25.472
I'm not getting separated again.

45:25.556 --> 45:28.851
You guys do what you want. I'm staying.

45:36.191 --> 45:38.819
-Well, she's stubborn.
-I told you.

45:40.529 --> 45:41.655
Yeah, well...

45:43.282 --> 45:44.491
so am I.

45:45.534 --> 45:46.618
Will--

45:47.911 --> 45:49.580
All right, now. Here we go.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.750
One, two. One, two, three, four.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.047
Maybe we should wait outside.

46:01.216 --> 46:04.011
Nah, I think... I think here's good.

46:05.971 --> 46:09.266
If this thing Lilly found in the sewers
really scares it like she said,

46:09.975 --> 46:12.519
it's a chance it can stop it.
Like, for good.

46:13.604 --> 46:16.273
But we think we'd have a better chance
if we could all be together until--

46:16.356 --> 46:17.608
Enough.

46:17.691 --> 46:19.818
You really expect my dad
to let me go back down there?

46:19.902 --> 46:22.112
No, you're not going anywhere,
but I get it.

46:23.322 --> 46:24.406
He's worried about you.

46:25.449 --> 46:26.617
Right?

46:26.700 --> 46:28.535
Well, yes, sir. But that's-- that's not--

46:28.619 --> 46:30.287
You really care
about my daughter, don't you?

46:31.330 --> 46:33.749
Yes, sir.

46:35.167 --> 46:38.212
We have that in common.
That's why I can't let her go.

46:39.671 --> 46:43.008
So, what, the two of you
been spending a lot of time together then?

46:43.091 --> 46:44.468
-Daddy.
-Hush up, now.

46:45.093 --> 46:46.345
You have a new gentleman friend.

46:47.179 --> 46:49.014
I'm your father.
I should know him a little better.

46:51.183 --> 46:52.851
Let me ask you something, William.

46:55.229 --> 46:56.438
What's your favorite movie?

47:02.110 --> 47:03.987
That kiddie killer's still out there.

47:04.822 --> 47:08.200
-Where the hell else can we look?
-We've already covered the Barrens.

47:08.283 --> 47:10.869
There's a whole sewer system
he could be hiding in.

47:11.578 --> 47:14.581
I say we go in, split up,
and search it all again.

47:14.665 --> 47:17.501
How about that area
outside the rail yards

47:17.584 --> 47:19.169
where the hobos used to come through?

47:19.878 --> 47:22.756
Tomorrow, we get the others,
the Boone brothers, maybe,

47:22.840 --> 47:24.675
-some dogs--
-He's not there.

47:28.345 --> 47:29.346
Grogan.

47:30.264 --> 47:32.766
I know where he's hiding,
and it ain't the rail yards.

47:32.850 --> 47:34.601
-You serious?
-Yeah.

47:35.435 --> 47:37.020
A lady called in a tip.

47:37.771 --> 47:39.439
Didn't leave her name, but...

47:40.482 --> 47:42.150
well, considering the nature of the place

47:42.234 --> 47:44.528
she was pointing at,
I'd say it's a pretty safe bet.

47:45.028 --> 47:47.573
-Are you gonna arrest him?
-Well, there's a problem.

47:48.824 --> 47:52.244
See, when the tip came in,
I was cleaning out my desk

47:52.327 --> 47:53.829
'cause the deputy mayor

47:54.413 --> 47:56.039
just relieved me of my duties.

47:56.582 --> 48:00.043
Seems they've lost confidence
in my ability to...

48:00.919 --> 48:02.421
serve and protect.

48:03.088 --> 48:05.966
So, no. No, I couldn't even...

48:07.175 --> 48:08.844
couldn't even give him a parking ticket.

48:10.387 --> 48:11.763
What are you telling us for?

48:56.391 --> 48:58.852
It's the wrong song...

48:59.686 --> 49:02.522
-Look who made it.
-What's happening, man?

49:02.606 --> 49:05.984
Your smile is lovely
It's the wrong smile

49:06.276 --> 49:11.406
It's not his smile
But such a lovely smile

49:11.490 --> 49:15.619
That it's all right with me

49:16.620 --> 49:19.915
You can't know
How happy I am

49:19.998 --> 49:21.541
That we met

49:21.708 --> 49:26.338
I'm strangely attracted to you...

49:26.880 --> 49:30.384
Here you go. Careful now,
she's got some sting.

49:30.926 --> 49:31.969
Thanks.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.724
Young Master Will's friends.

49:38.517 --> 49:40.602
-Whatcha drinkin'?
-Two Cokes.

49:41.228 --> 49:42.437
Two Cokes coming up.

49:51.571 --> 49:52.781
What are they doing?

49:54.491 --> 49:56.243
I think they're dancing.

49:56.326 --> 49:57.953
What kind of dancing is that?

50:00.247 --> 50:01.331
Two Cokes?

50:02.624 --> 50:03.667
Thank you.

50:07.087 --> 50:08.839
I think there's something wrong
with this Coke.

50:08.922 --> 50:10.507
Well, nah, you got a...

50:11.216 --> 50:12.426
Air Force Coke.

50:13.844 --> 50:14.970
Tastes kind of funny.

50:15.721 --> 50:17.389
That's the taste of freedom, son.

50:17.472 --> 50:19.766
And it's all right

50:19.850 --> 50:26.690
And it's all right with me

50:26.773 --> 50:28.025
Freedom tastes weird.

50:35.615 --> 50:38.618
They did play War of the Worlds
at the rec center on base last year.

50:38.702 --> 50:40.704
-I-- I-- I like that.
-Great answer.

50:43.498 --> 50:45.417
You seem like a bright young man, William.

50:51.173 --> 50:52.299
Truth is...

50:55.510 --> 50:57.179
if anything were to happen to me...

50:58.805 --> 51:00.640
it's good to know
someone of your character

51:01.683 --> 51:03.435
is looking out for my baby girl.

51:09.274 --> 51:11.735
Nothing's gonna happen
to you or Ronnie, sir.

51:12.402 --> 51:13.528
Not on my watch.

51:26.625 --> 51:27.626
Shit.

51:28.168 --> 51:30.337
Not even the old Hanlon charm, huh?

51:30.378 --> 51:32.172
I tried. She won't budge.

51:32.923 --> 51:34.633
Man, that sucks.

51:35.300 --> 51:38.303
-What are we gonna do now?
-Hey, Sticks, you play?

51:39.471 --> 51:41.431
I don't know. A little.

51:41.515 --> 51:44.684
Look, we're about to swing out,
but our drummer's a little bit...

51:45.769 --> 51:47.229
indisposed.

51:48.522 --> 51:50.273
What do you say? Wanna sit in?

51:51.441 --> 51:52.859
Come on!

51:52.943 --> 51:55.987
I've never seen you play before.
What's a couple more minutes?

51:59.616 --> 52:00.742
What are we playing?

52:01.368 --> 52:02.702
You know how to use these?

52:10.377 --> 52:13.088
Say, it's only a paper moon

52:13.171 --> 52:16.091
Sailing over a cardboard sea

52:16.174 --> 52:18.301
But it wouldn't be make-believe

52:18.426 --> 52:20.887
If you believed in me

52:29.271 --> 52:31.648
I love Air Force Coke.

53:19.654 --> 53:20.739
Go, Rich!

53:48.975 --> 53:50.518
It's kinda nice out here, huh?

53:51.061 --> 53:53.939
Just the two of us.
Can finally hear each other talk.

53:55.523 --> 53:56.983
And, girl, let me tell you something.

53:57.567 --> 53:59.736
I can listen to the sound
of your voice till sunup.

53:59.819 --> 54:02.280
You sure you don't mean
the sound of your own?

54:04.950 --> 54:06.451
Come on. Light me up.

54:22.926 --> 54:24.928
You guys expecting more people tonight?

54:25.720 --> 54:26.888
No.

54:33.937 --> 54:35.063
Goddamn.

54:37.983 --> 54:41.194
Say, you wanna kill
those headlights, jack?

54:43.405 --> 54:44.906
What's wrong with these people?

54:54.457 --> 54:56.126
Get behind me. Now!
