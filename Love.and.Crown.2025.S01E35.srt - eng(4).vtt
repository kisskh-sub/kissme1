00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:28.930
Surround the Capital

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:29.900
and wait for His Majesty's command!

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.570
Yes, General!

00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:59.380
Xiao Huan.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.570
You actually showed up.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.740
Your Majesty, welcome back.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.340
All of them

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.100
are no longer under your control.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.380
Purge the court of treacherous ministers!

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.500
Slay the demoness!

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.410
So what?

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.740
He's still under my control.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:28.740
Hongqing.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.140
Escort everyone to safety.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.290
Xiao Qianqing,

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.410
kill him.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:07.980
Huan?

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.900
I...

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:21.740
Xiao Qianqing!

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.050
I will perish together with you!

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:32.740
Xiao Qianqing!

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.770
Xiao Qianqing!

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.450
So, you were the reason

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.450
he was able to break free of my control.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.140
You expelled the Heartbane within you by force.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.170
Do you not fear death at all?

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:46.860
Do you know who I am?

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.260
I won't let you die that easily.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.080
I will tie my life

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.520
to yours.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.340
You and I now share the same blood,

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.950
and we're bound by life and death.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.130
The Heartbane in me will flow into your blood as well.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.940
When the Heartbane Bell is rung,

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.370
the pain

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.650
will help you break free from the Prison of Thousand Threads.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.850
Shi Yan, Hongqing,

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:09.890
protect them.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.060
All of you,

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.730
you think that you're full of passion.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.100
All of you want to be saints.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.220
You want to save everyone.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.490
That disgusts me to no end!

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.220
It's more fun to kill people.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.180
What? Do you intend to kill me?

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.460
If you kill me, Xiao Qianqing will die as well.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.130
You cannot kill me.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.220
But I can make sure all of you

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.420
die here!

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.150
Du Tingxin.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.140
You can come at me if you hate me that much.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.160
This has nothing to do with other people.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.900
You were born prone to cold-related ailments, and your body was broken.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.830
Having endured a lifetime of suffering, now, you want to be a wise ruler

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.260
and protect the people.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.370
But I?

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.300
I want to destroy everything you want to protect.

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:13.010
This is the ultimate Heartbane

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.660
forged from the blood of countless souls.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.140
If I attach it to the flying bugs,

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.290
you won't be able to save everyone

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.860
even if you have the antidote.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.090
Du Tingxin, have you lost your mind?

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.290
I have!

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.010
So what?

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.530
I lost my mind ever since I found out

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.860
that I was a princess.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.530
I lost my mind ever since I found out

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.770
that you were my elder brother.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.050
There's no longer a place for me in the world anyway.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.810
Why don't I go all out and lose my mind completely, then?

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.140
Do you truly think

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.010
you can succeed?

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.090
Xiao Huan, what are you doing?

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.620
The Moon-Eclipse within me

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.900
is the most lethal venom of all.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.730
Naturally, it can suppress every venom in the world.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.220
Do you have a death wish?

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.490

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.620

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:21.860
is my duty.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.940
and enhance your inner force to kill the bugs.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.570
But that'll only make the Moon-Eclipse go out of control.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.940
You'll lose all of your senses and go mad soon enough.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.730
And, you'll die from the pain and torment caused by Moon-Eclipse!
