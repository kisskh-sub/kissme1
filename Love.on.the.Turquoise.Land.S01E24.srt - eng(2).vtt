I'll get you out.

Yan Tuo, I'll get you out.

00:05:35.995 --> 00:05:37.516

00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:38.596
Get up.

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.219
I'll get you out, Yan Tuo.

Yan Tuo.

00:05:50.588 --> 00:05:51.748
Wait here.

00:06:19.388 --> 00:06:20.588
What new species is this?

00:06:21.028 --> 00:06:22.868
Whatever. Just take it down.

00:08:09.635 --> 00:08:10.555
Is he Sun Zhou?

00:08:10.795 --> 00:08:12.074
Explain later.

(Roadsound Mining)

00:10:02.579 --> 00:10:03.418
Go to the hospital

00:10:03.418 --> 00:10:05.058
for body checks first?

00:10:05.418 --> 00:10:06.178
You look...

00:10:06.178 --> 00:10:06.778
No need.

00:10:22.058 --> 00:10:23.178
About Sun Zhou,

00:10:24.219 --> 00:10:24.819
I...

00:10:26.219 --> 00:10:27.178
No need to explain.

00:10:29.018 --> 00:10:30.658
I don't think it was your call.

00:10:37.459 --> 00:10:38.859
Let's get him home first.

00:10:40.138 --> 00:10:41.538
I'll handle it then.

00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:01.979
Mr. Xing.

00:11:02.658 --> 00:11:04.459
Dinner is ready. Come inside.

00:11:06.859 --> 00:11:09.058
No need. Thanks.

00:11:12.459 --> 00:11:13.658
I'll bring it to you.

00:11:14.658 --> 00:11:15.339
Appreciate it.

00:11:41.979 --> 00:11:43.219
I've been thinking,

00:11:43.819 --> 00:11:45.178
from Li Ergou's disappearance

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:47.819
to Lin Xirou becoming human,

00:11:48.778 --> 00:11:50.099
it happened remarkably fast.

00:11:53.499 --> 00:11:55.099
But in the next twenty years,

00:11:55.898 --> 00:11:57.258
Lin Xirou only transformed

00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:58.619
a dozen humanoid Earth Fiends.

00:11:59.339 --> 00:12:00.219
Could it be

00:12:00.643 --> 00:12:02.819
her transformation into a human
was just a coincidence,

00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:05.499
and she's been trying
to replicate it ever since?

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:13.619
It takes five hundred years

00:12:13.619 --> 00:12:14.979
for a snake to become a spirit.

00:12:15.459 --> 00:12:16.898
Turning Earth Fiends human

00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:18.938
can't be that simple either.

00:12:26.298 --> 00:12:27.459
Maybe besides blood bags,

00:12:29.258 --> 00:12:30.859
something else is needed.

00:12:32.579 --> 00:12:34.099
Something rarer.

00:12:35.898 --> 00:12:37.339
I envy the older generation.

00:12:38.018 --> 00:12:39.099
Everything's simple.

00:12:40.018 --> 00:12:42.418
Easy to distinguish
between fiends and humans.

00:12:43.778 --> 00:12:44.898
But anyway,

00:12:45.178 --> 00:12:46.499
we can't be sure

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:47.699
the records

00:12:47.699 --> 00:12:49.418
are complete.

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:56.699
Contact me anytime.

00:12:57.938 --> 00:12:58.658
Thanks.

00:13:00.859 --> 00:13:02.499
Though there were more rational options,

00:13:03.538 --> 00:13:04.538
what he did

00:13:04.979 --> 00:13:06.018
wasn't exactly wrong.

00:13:07.939 --> 00:13:08.859
Don't blame Xing Shen.

00:13:10.099 --> 00:13:11.499
He just did it for South Mountain.

00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:22.738
I've brought Lin Ling
and Mr. Changxi here.

00:14:28.658 --> 00:14:29.698
When I'm not around,

00:14:29.779 --> 00:14:31.698
South Mountain Hunters
will be on guard around.

00:14:31.859 --> 00:14:32.898
They stay safe.

00:14:33.178 --> 00:14:34.138
Don't worry.

00:14:37.498 --> 00:14:38.938
Miss Nie, you're back.

00:14:40.099 --> 00:14:40.859
This is...

00:14:41.498 --> 00:14:42.339
Mr. Yan?

00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:43.418
How did he...

00:14:43.539 --> 00:14:44.898
He was on a business trip

00:14:45.019 --> 00:14:47.059
and met some ruthless competitors.

00:14:47.379 --> 00:14:48.859
They locked him in a coal mine.

00:14:49.698 --> 00:14:51.218
It's a long story.

00:14:51.418 --> 00:14:52.579
I'll tell you later.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.698
Alright, get in.

00:14:57.059 --> 00:14:57.698
Let's go.

00:15:00.498 --> 00:15:02.579
Ling just fell asleep.

00:15:02.738 --> 00:15:03.978
Should I wake her?

00:15:04.658 --> 00:15:05.379
Ms. Lu.

00:15:08.379 --> 00:15:09.059
Thank you.

00:15:21.418 --> 00:15:22.819
You go in with Ms. Lu first.

00:15:22.859 --> 00:15:23.819
I'll be back later.

00:15:26.299 --> 00:15:26.978
Ms. Lu.

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:29.978
Don't let Lin Ling
and Mr. Changxi know for now.

00:15:30.458 --> 00:15:31.099
Understood.

00:15:31.819 --> 00:15:32.978
Mr. Yan, please.

00:15:34.779 --> 00:15:35.418
Go.

00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:23.539
Mr. Yan.

00:17:00.003 --> 00:17:03.751
(Peace and Joy, All Things Go Well)

00:17:03.751 --> 00:17:07.491
(Joy Comes Upon)

00:17:46.259 --> 00:17:46.978
Thank you.

00:17:48.339 --> 00:17:49.178
No problem.

00:17:54.218 --> 00:17:55.339
I saw Sun Zhou.

00:18:00.658 --> 00:18:01.738
Didn't you say

00:18:01.978 --> 00:18:03.259
you'd try your best to help him?

00:18:04.218 --> 00:18:05.458
Since we can't save him,

00:18:06.379 --> 00:18:07.299
making him alive

00:18:07.738 --> 00:18:08.859
and become one of us

00:18:09.619 --> 00:18:10.779
is kind of help.

00:18:10.938 --> 00:18:12.458
Just like Locust you raised?

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:16.059
In your eyes,

00:18:16.738 --> 00:18:18.458
any difference
between humans and fiends?

00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:19.299
Of course yes.

00:18:23.178 --> 00:18:25.059
Locust wasn't successfully tamed.

00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:27.299
I underestimated it.

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:29.458
Sun Zhou has red threads
piercing his pupils,

00:18:29.978 --> 00:18:31.498
but he still remains his humanity.

00:18:31.619 --> 00:18:32.898
After being trained by Yu Rong,

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:33.579
he could've...

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:34.418
He's dead.

00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:42.339
Today in the mine,

00:18:42.691 --> 00:18:43.539
we saw an Earth Fiend

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:45.779
that didn't fully transform
into human form.

00:18:48.418 --> 00:18:49.099
Indeed,

00:18:49.698 --> 00:18:50.859
he did become one of us

00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:51.978
and fought alongside us.

00:18:52.819 --> 00:18:55.138
But he couldn't live like us.

00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:02.418
You may leave.

00:19:02.738 --> 00:19:04.259
You are not needed here anymore.

00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:00.418
Miss Nie.

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:01.619
I've searched.

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:03.458
There's no Xicang instant noodles here.

00:22:03.619 --> 00:22:05.379
You usually don't eat
this kind of stuff.

00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:06.898
Should I go out and look for some?

00:22:07.178 --> 00:22:07.898
Don't bother.

00:22:08.178 --> 00:22:09.339
These dried noodles will do.

00:22:10.019 --> 00:22:10.619
It's fine.

00:22:10.619 --> 00:22:11.938
Ms. Lu, you can go rest.

00:22:11.938 --> 00:22:12.898
I can handle it.

00:22:33.218 --> 00:22:34.019
Let me do it.

00:22:52.619 --> 00:22:53.498
Miss Nie.

00:22:54.059 --> 00:22:56.379
I've never seen you cook before.

00:22:57.938 --> 00:22:59.299
I'm worried he's starving.

00:23:03.555 --> 00:23:04.276
I'll do it.

00:23:58.243 --> 00:23:59.763
It's late now.

00:23:59.884 --> 00:24:01.203
I can only make something simple.

00:24:08.483 --> 00:24:10.763
How about I leave it by the door?

00:26:42.124 --> 00:26:42.844
Thanks.

00:26:48.804 --> 00:26:49.723
Get some rest.

00:27:09.324 --> 00:27:10.284
Over at the mine,

00:27:10.284 --> 00:27:11.276
Big Head and Shan Qiang

00:27:11.276 --> 00:27:13.003
temporarily restrained those underlings.

00:27:13.844 --> 00:27:15.203
The biggest gain this time

00:27:15.203 --> 00:27:17.283
is finding that Earth Fiend
down in the mine.

00:27:17.564 --> 00:27:21.683
So, that Earth Fiend down in the mine

00:27:23.084 --> 00:27:24.683
had already taken on human form

00:27:25.564 --> 00:27:28.084
but still retained some brutish nature.

00:27:28.683 --> 00:27:30.604
In the middle of a humanoid Earth Fiend

00:27:31.364 --> 00:27:33.564
and a primal Earth Fiend.

00:27:33.564 --> 00:27:34.164
Exactly.

00:27:34.644 --> 00:27:35.604
That mine

00:27:35.604 --> 00:27:37.164
was likely a transition spot

00:27:37.164 --> 00:27:39.084
for Earth Fiends freshly
transformed into humans.

00:27:39.644 --> 00:27:41.683
They need a transition spot

00:27:42.003 --> 00:27:44.203
to adapt and learn
how to live on the ground.

00:27:46.763 --> 00:27:49.283
Could there be more
humanoid Earth Fiends down there?

00:27:49.483 --> 00:27:50.243
Not sure.

00:27:50.804 --> 00:27:51.963
Without Sun Zhou,

00:27:52.243 --> 00:27:54.203
we couldn't even handle that big guy.

00:27:55.124 --> 00:27:56.404
No time to explore further.

00:27:59.324 --> 00:28:01.203
This mine must be

00:28:02.283 --> 00:28:03.723
critical to them.

00:28:06.283 --> 00:28:07.364
Must make good use of it.

00:28:25.003 --> 00:28:25.723
(Tuo.)

00:28:28.963 --> 00:28:31.283
(Your biggest helper all along)

00:28:32.243 --> 00:28:33.124
(was me.)

00:28:33.844 --> 00:28:34.884
(But such things)

00:28:35.683 --> 00:28:36.804
(won't happen again.)

00:28:37.963 --> 00:28:40.124
(Everything is clear now.)

00:28:41.243 --> 00:28:42.763
(So you have nothing to fear.)

00:28:43.884 --> 00:28:45.283
(Starting today,)

00:28:46.164 --> 00:28:48.523
(we draw distinct lines)

00:28:49.044 --> 00:28:51.483
between humans and fiends.
