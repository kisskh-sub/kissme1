[The Sparrow's Gambit]

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.860
[Episode 16]

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.900
What are you talking about?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.660
I've been in the hospital
the whole time.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.980
Why are you slandering me?

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.420
Lin Qingyi!

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.980
I am Qingmao.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.420
I've come back.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.140
Lin Qingyi?

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.260
More than ten years ago,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.100
Mr. Wang framed the Lin family

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.020
for opium trafficking.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.860
I knew nothing about it.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.580
I won't help you commit perjury.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.180
Framed?

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.020
The Lin family?

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.700
Miss Liu, are you referring

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.740
to the former Chamber
of Commerce President, Mr. Lin,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.540
who was once
Song City's leading philanthropist?

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.620
Rumors said the Lin family

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.460
resisted arrest for opium trafficking

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.820
and set a fire, committing suicide,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.020
killing all thirteen members.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.180
It seems there's more to the story now.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.380
I know the story.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.180
A great fire destroyed the Lin family
back then.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.780
The police rushed to close the case
without evidence.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.060
Soon after,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.140
a butler named Wang
from the Lin household,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.260
using a letter from President Lin
as proof,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.180
took over
all the Lin family's businesses.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.860
This butler named Wang

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.660
couldn't be you, could it, Mr. Wang?

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.180
So it was him all along!

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.300
How despicable!

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.500
I'm sorry.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.140
It was not me.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.660
All of this

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.380
is a lie she fabricated to frame me.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.060
Since you are ruthless,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.220
don't expect loyalty from me.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.220
Who between us is really lying,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.740
Butler Wang?

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.180
The year I turned seven,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.180
you started trafficking opium.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.460
Back then, to help you make money,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.940
I would pour basin after basin

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.380
of cold water over myself

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.820
until I made myself sick.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.660
That way,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.740
you could use the excuse
of buying medicine

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.940
to traffic opium.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.940
Shut up!

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Nonsense!

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.300
Mr. Wang,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.740
why not hear the rest?

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.740
The year I turned ten,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.220
you were caught.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.820
They urged you to turn yourself in,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.540
but you set a fire

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.580
that burned the entire Lin family.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.780
Then you raised their daughter

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.940
to be your own executioner.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.860
You are evil to the core!

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.780
Wang Wan'er!

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.620
You're spewing lies!

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.020
Liu Rumeng, that you are Lin Qingyi

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.340
doesn't surprise me in the least.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.140
I have no regrets.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.860
I'd rather die than become a ghost
under your command.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.580
I still have more revelations.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.820
Back then, Wang Penghui and...

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.940
Put the gun down!

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.260
It wasn't me!

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.660
How can you still deny it at this point?

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.540
What a show, father
and daughter turning on each other!

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.380
Just one woman reduced you to this?

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.780
What woman?

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.580
The Lin family... That Lin family girl?

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.980
Lin Qingyi?

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.740
I told you to kill her back then.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.020
I did kill her!

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.380
But... but... who knew...

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.660
You've brought this on yourself.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.780
Find a way to get me out.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.180
I'll settle this with her myself.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.660
You know.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.420
I never give a second chance.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.020
I still have opium!

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.340
I still have opium!

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.860
In the warehouse!

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.020
I can still be useful to you!

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.340
It's over.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.460
It's not over yet.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.740
Liu Rumeng.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.460
Wang Wan'er was shot from a distance.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.420
It wasn't done by Wang Penghui.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.460
Traces of Qingmao's weapon

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.620
were found on the injured officers
at the scene.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.820
Some witnesses confirm

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.700
that Hua, from The Paramount,
appeared at the dock

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.220
under the identity of Qingmao.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.380
She needs to be arrested
for questioning.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.780
But she's missing now.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.060
Please cooperate with our investigation.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.860
Hua, you must leave Song City.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.940
I can't lose you.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.740
I know.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.540
If I stay,

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.180
I'll become a weapon
they can use against you.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.180
Meng has loved dumplings
since she was a child.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.060
I'm afraid that after I leave,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.180
no one will be left
to make them for her.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.420
So, Wenbin, you need to learn properly,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.660
so you can take care of her for me
in the future.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.540
Hua, don't worry.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.740
I will definitely take good care of her.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.940
Here, Wenbin,

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.420
learn how.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.540
Okay.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.420
Rumeng, besides vengeance,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.180
you must live a good life too.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.620
Let go!

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.780
Let go!

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.540
I have Hua.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.100
If Qingmao doesn't turn herself in
within three days...

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.780
I'm going to the police station!

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.100
No! It's too dangerous for you
to go alone now!

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.740
I can't let Hua die in my place.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.420
I'll say this one last time.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.220
As long as you go to the police

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.980
and expose Liu Rumeng as Qingmao,

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.540
the true culprit who killed Wang Wan'er,

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.140
I can let you live.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.300
Moreover,

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.180
I can guarantee you

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.820
a life of wealth and luxury
for the rest of your days.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.260
If you refuse,

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.020
I won't beat you anymore.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.740
But my men here

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.140
haven't had any fun in quite a while.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.900
So?

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.380
Do you agree or not?

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.980
Not bad looking.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.060
Come here.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.460
Let go!

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.620
Come on, chick.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.580
Let go!

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.660
I'll do it.
