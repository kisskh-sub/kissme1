Greetings, Miss Ling.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.660
I've gathered all members of Fenglai Pavilion from every region.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.540
They've been slipping into the Capital in secret

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.530
You've served two reigns

you rose and fell three times

Your Majesty's decision to exile me

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.940

to select worthy talents for Great Qi

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.060
I'm here.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.100
Don't be afraid, Ying.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:24.890
Huan.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.530
What exactly happened

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.100
during the fire at Luling Palace that day?

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.180
What do you think happened?

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.940
Why did you abandon Ying?

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.460
You knew how she loved you, respected you.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.890
Why didn't you save her?

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.850
You and I

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.820
were born into the imperial family.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.100
Yes.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.820
We were born into the imperial family.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.130
Is this

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.700
the ending you all wanted?

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.730
What did Du Tingxin do to you?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.250
Xiao Huan.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.770
Why did you choose to jump from Phoenix Terrace?

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.370
You haven't even told me the truth.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.820
What should I do now?

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.910
[Virtue Held Within]

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.460
Your Highness,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.650
the Imperial Preceptor ordered me to bring the Princess of Ding'an back.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.650
Where's Cangcang?

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.100
Even like this,

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.220
all you care about...

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.730
Tell me where Ling Cangcang is!

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.610
She's fine.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.890
She's the Empress of Great Qi.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.340
Of course, she's in Linghe Hall.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.060
Your Majesty,

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:15.850
it's been a long while.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.940
It feels like a lifetime.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.010
Preceptor Du, you went to all this trouble

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.980
to bring me back to Linghe Hall.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.340
Surely it's not for a casual chat.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:28.650
You're the Empress.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.890
Naturally, you should be in Linghe Hall.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.770
I'm only doing my duty as Imperial Preceptor

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.610
to escort Your Majesty back to the palace.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.580
You want to kill me?

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.490
Of course.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.700
I can't wait to cut you into pieces.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.420
If not for you,

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.980
Xiao Huan wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.850
His condition today

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.890
is all thanks to you.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.220
Your fate is said to curse His Majesty.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.730
As long as you're near him,

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.770
he will never meet a good end.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:09.910
He's not dead.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.900
He can't be dead.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.220
I saw him jump from Phoenix Terrace with my own eyes.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.330
Even if you lie to yourself,

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.620
I'm telling you, he will not survive.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.220
For you,

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.330
Xiao Huan gave up the only medicine that could save him.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.570
What were you doing?

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:29.490
For you,

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.660
he risked his life to travel alone to Xijiang for peace negotiations.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.050
What were you doing?

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:34.900
Ling Cangcang,

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.050
he gave you everything he could.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.250
Now that he's already jumped from Phoenix Terrace.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.730
Why are you still alive?

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.380
Why didn't you

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.420
die with him?

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.090
Madam.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.180
Madam.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.140
They found this blood-soaked robe in the Qining River.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.420
How could I...

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.050
How could I possibly

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.570
let you die so easily?

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.420
Don't worry.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.700
I won't torment you for long.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.050
Once I've had my fun,

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.290
I'll send you

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.530
to your demise.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.460
Du Tingxin,

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.010
if you want to kill me,

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.330
do it now.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.530
Otherwise,

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.900
I swear I'll make you pay.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.770
As matters stand,

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.980
what price could you make me pay?

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.730
It's been three days since His Majesty fell into the river.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.980
The Capital Patrol Office has been dispatched

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.860
and searched the entire Qining River,

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.980
but they've found no trace of him.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:12.530
Your Highness,

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.660
the Qining River is dangerous.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.180
There are countless undercurrents and whirlpools.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.460
I fear His Majesty

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.290
may not survive.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.920
- Yes. - Yes.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.490
The nation can't be without a ruler for even a day.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.050
His Majesty has met with disaster

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.180
and left no heir.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.290
Prince of Yuzhang, you're the regent now.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.730
For the sake of the people of Great Qi,

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.180
you should...

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.220
How presumptuous!

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.700
Minister Xing,

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:52.290
what are you trying to say?

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.220
His Majesty's condition remains unclear,

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:56.380
and all of you

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.810
are already rushing to curry favor

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.770
with the Prince of Yuzhang.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.380
How shameful.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.090
If His Majesty

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.220
never returns,

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.220
what will become of Great Qi?

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:12.810
What will become of the imperial court?

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.960
In my opinion,

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.330
at a time like this,

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.290
only the Prince of Yuzhang...

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:19.860
I'm not interested.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.010
Prince of Yuzhang.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.180
If any of you

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.420
wish to fight over the throne, go ahead.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.380
I'm not stepping into this mess.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.860
His Majesty slipped

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.860
and fell into the river from Phoenix Terrace.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.180
All the ministers present saw it with your own eyes.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.220
No one who falls into the Qining River

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.140
has ever survived.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.140
Even though the Capital Patrol Office

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.900
is still searching...

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.220
Whether alive or dead,

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:57.900
we must find His Majesty.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.900
Until it's confirmed,

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.090
no one

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.490
is to covet the throne.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:07.730
Minister Lin,

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.090
I know you're loyal to the Emperor.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.220
I myself have known His Majesty since childhood.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.180
All the more reason I can't accept this either.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.860
But if His Majesty can't be found,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.620
we can't wait forever.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.900
You're right, Preceptor Du.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.940
- True. - Yes.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.460
However,

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.490
according to the founding laws of Great Qi,

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.810
if the emperor's life or death remains unknown,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.090
only after one hundred days

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.220
with no word

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.860
may the throne pass to another.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.770
One hundred days?

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.620
If any of you doubt it,

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.380
you may consult the law

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.810
and see whether I lie.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:52.700
Uh...

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.530
Minister Lin has served two reigns

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:03.010
and even helped the late Emperor revise the code.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.660
He's never mistaken.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.490
However,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.770
during these one hundred days...

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.330
We must ask the Prince of Yuzhang

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.290
to act as Regent

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.010
during this period.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.700
When His Majesty returns,

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.090
all will naturally return

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.660
to its rightful order.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:22.170
Yes.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:24.360
That makes sense.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.730
Please stay, Prince of Yuzhang.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.980
His Majesty jumped from Phoenix Terrace,

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.420
and we don't know if he's alive.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.090
You don't seem to care.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.570
Why should I care about

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.770
the murderer who killed my mother and Ying?

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.420
Do you have no interest in the throne?

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.380
Since when have I ever cared for it?

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.570
I only wanted the throne

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.050
because Xiao Huan valued it more than his own life.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:10.730
If he dies,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.900
what use

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.700
is the throne to me?

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.770
Right now I have only one thought.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.810
I hope he doesn't die in the Qining River.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.250
I want to take his life with my own hands.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.530
Then you should think about

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.250
how to find His Majesty first.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.530
By the way,

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.620
the Empress weeps day and night.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.490
She says she wants to die with His Majesty.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.490
Your Highness,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.770
what do you think we should do with her?

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.900
What do the rites say?

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.220
If there is no news

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.090
from His Majesty after a hundred days,

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.770
the Empress must be buried with him.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.180
We'll follow this rite then.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.040
I shall obey.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:26:59.600
Your Highness,

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.990
when the decree announcing the emperor's passing

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.460
is issued,

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.050
please deliver the decree

He fooled me.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.970
Now it's clear

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.010
that he was the one who killed Ying.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.810
He would rather choose death

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:26.620
than admit it.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.380
So he can't blame me

Her Majesty is grieving too deeply

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.300
and shouldn't be disturbed.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.250
But she must repay me

Give it back to me.

The pain of having your heart ripped out.

The pain of a thousand arrows through the chest.

You will be buried with him.

But before that,

I want you to eat well

Truly a lovely couple who would die for each other.

He said he wanted to die with dignity.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.410
Then he turned around

and disappeared.

there's still hope.

No.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.410
Because they use more sugar.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.530
When it's sweet,
