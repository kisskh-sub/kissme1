00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.940
Xubu Huai, come out.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.010
The daughter of the lord is sassy.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.920
- Mr. Xubu will suffer. - Where are you?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.630
Come out.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.060
Xubu Huai.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.560
Princess.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.220
I was going to the Lord's Mansion

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.450
to meet you.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.340
Why are you so impatient?

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.370
You came to me early in the morning.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.860
Couldn't you

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.770
wait a few hours?

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:21.830
I couldn't wait.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.460
If I don't make it clear to you,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.760
I can't eat.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.000
All right. Come to my tent, and we'll talk it over.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.480
It's not appropriate for us to be alone.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.270
People will misunderstand us.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.560
Mr. Wen has promised to marry you to me.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.080
Then you're my fiancée.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.870
What are you worried about?

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.560
That's why I'm here.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.520
Xubu Huai.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.070
I don't want to marry you.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.880
Forget about it.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.430
You can't disobey your parents.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.120
I heard that you're a filial daughter.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.660
Do you want Mr. Wen to be accused

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.480
of failing to educate his daughter?

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.080
You...

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.830
Princess.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.680
You're not married.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.520
So is Xubu Huai.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.270
I think it's good for you

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.470
to get married.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.870
Leader Che.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.680
I've made it clear.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.520
I don't want to marry him because I'm arrogant.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.040
If you want to call off the engagement,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.000
you should ask Mr. Wen to come in person.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.190
Princess, you came to call it off alone.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.800
I think

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.390
it's not appropriate.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.600
Since when did the Ma Gang value the rules?

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.560
We're going to marry the Lord's Mansion.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.950
Then,

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.640
we have to follow the rules here.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.120
If you're thirsty or hungry,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.560
you're welcome to come.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.640
If there's nothing else,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.000
please leave.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.430
I heard that the couple-to-be shouldn't see each other

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.950
until they get married.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.870
It is

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.790
unlucky.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.790
Don't think I can't read your mind.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.080
You don't want to marry her.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.790
Leader, you saw it.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.790
I'm afraid

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.160
I can't control her.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.520
Have pity on me.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.120
Don't let me suffer.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.830
Do you think

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.120
anyone is good enough for her?

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.640
She's the only daughter of the Lord's Mansion.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.640
If you marry her,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.680
the Ma Gang and the Lord's Mansion

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.160
are a family

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.240
and partners.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.790
Then,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.080
we don't have to be afraid of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.750
We're not afraid of them now.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.120
Idiot.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.200
If you don't marry her,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.680
maybe Mr. Wen

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.910
will choose his son-in-law

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.790
in the Chamber of Commerce.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.910
If they join forces,

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.560
can you fight them?

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.680
Besides,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.750
she's pretty.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.340
You

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.000
are very lucky

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.200
to marry this straight,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.680
beautiful woman.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.730
You're so lucky.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.390
Leader.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.520
You guys,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.240
kill someone for me?

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.790
Who do you want to kill?

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.040
Xubu Huai from Ma Gang.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.680
What did he do to you?

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.680
He wants to marry me.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.120
He wants to die.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.200
What did you say?

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.350
Will you do it for me?

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.000
I'm no match for him.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.470
I'll die.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.120
Coward.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.080
You come with me.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.790
I'm worse.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.950
I only know how to save people, not how to kill.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.390
I don't need you to kill him.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.080
You will pretend to be my lover.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.270
So that Xubu Huai can call off the engagement.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.240
Wait.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.040
Why doesn't he

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.200
have to fight for you?

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.950
Why did you ask me to kill him?

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.000
Will you go?

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.080
Never mind.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.200
I'd better not go.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:58.850
Fu Sheng doesn't want to go either.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.650
Right, Fu Sheng?

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.160
No.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.950
I've never

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.080
been a lover.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.530
How do I fake it?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.240
You don't have to do anything.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.660
Just cooperate with me.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:13.560
All right.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.720
What? You can't do that.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.720
You should at least change your clothes.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.640
Your clothes are not good.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.200
Don't embarrass Xichuan's Princess.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.910
That makes sense.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.200
I'll take care of it.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.830
That's a deal.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.750
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.830
Then,

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.910
enjoy yourselves.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.600
Are you leaving?

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.310
See you.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.120
What's wrong with my clothes?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.740
They are nice.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.830
It's another fake.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:53.390
Chairman.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.300
I think it's a good thing.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.200
Good thing?

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.120
Yes.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.200
Look.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.630
Since the people of Xichuan

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.390
started looking for it,

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.040
many bad people

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.460
have taken the opportunity

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.540
to make fake Bird Jade Plates

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.160
that look like the real one.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.460
Now, Xichuan

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.330
is full of these things.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.140
Even we can't find the real one.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:17.900
Song Jingye

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.810
is even less likely to find the real one.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.370
Who are you to talk?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.520
How dare you call Song Jingye by his name?

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.470
Chairman Song.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.080
That old thing is in my way.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.920
Yeah, he's in our way.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.640
But he knows all our men.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.430
We can't get close to him.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.620
We have Sun Siming.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.200
He came to us,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.160
and he's close to that old thing.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.470
Help me get out of the carriage.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.980
You'll wrinkle it.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.650
It's not as comfortable as my coarse clothes.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.250
We'll fix it quickly.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.170
Just bear with it.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.690
Let's go.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.500
Princess, Physician Fu.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.770
What brings you here?

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.690
Be natural and say hello.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.650
Hello.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.330
Mr. Xubu.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.940
I'm here to call off our engagement.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.020
Call off our engagement?

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.140
Fu Sheng and I are in love.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.210
We've pledged to get married.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:13.980
Right?

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.120
Our engagement was approved

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120
by our parents and the matchmaker.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.910
Your marriage

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.750
can't be taken seriously.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.470
Besides,

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.720
if you are willing to give me a chance,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.000
I'm sure

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.040
I can make you like me.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.640
I won't like you.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.680
I'll be blunt.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.390
You have to call off the engagement

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.430
no matter what.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.200
All right.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.680
It's okay if you want to call off the engagement.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.390
Does Mr. Wen know it?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.830
Mr. Xubu, if you don't agree to call off the engagement,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.830
you'll lose your reputation.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.200
What are you talking about?

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:55.750
Because

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.120
Fu Sheng and I...

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.500
We have...

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.200
You say it.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.510
What should I say?

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.120
Do you want me,

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.790
a girl, to say it?

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.430
I don't know what you're going to say.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.680
All right.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.430
Let's talk about it later.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.270
Someone.

Serve.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.050
This is a lamb

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.770
two or three months old.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.980
It's delicious and tender.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.520
It's rare to have you here.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.270
Have a taste.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.870
Princess.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.470
You eat first.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.560
Eat it yourself.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.430
Leave her alone.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.790
Let's eat.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.520
Come on.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.040
Wait.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.750
Then...

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.870
Taste it.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:52.200
Come on.

You're not dead yet?

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.880
You won't let me die,

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.550
so I dare not, sir.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.830
This poor life of mine

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.350
remains

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.720
at your disposal, sir.

Do something for me.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.040
Just say the word, Mr. Chairman.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.270
Tonight, make sure Song Jingye sees this.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.790
I don't care how, just do it.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.270
But he mustn't catch you.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.270
If you mess this up,

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.950
do you understand the consequences?

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.390
This...

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.040
What?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.270
You can't do it?

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.830
It's quite easy.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.480
Just,

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.160
my life is worthless

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.350
yet,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.350
for such a crucial task,

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.830
shouldn't there be a price?

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.950
You've got some nerve.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.550
Cowardly people

wouldn't dare to work for you, sir.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.040
Once it's done,

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.950
your whole family will be freed from slavery.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.760
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:18.880
Chairman,

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.270
this man cannot be kept around.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.070
You don't need to tell me.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.230
Any news

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.480
from the Lord's Mansion?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.880
He has rarely been seen lately.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.740
But his daughter Wen Jue

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.760
was seen making a scene

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.640
at the Ma Gang's gate this morning.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.800
That old fox Wen Yu

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.680
is aware that our association is gaining prominence.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:43.560
He's starting to fear us,

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.000
or he knows his time is running out.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.950
So, he wants to find a backer for his daughter.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.240
It seems the rumors around town

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.760
hold some truth.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:58.360
Chairman,

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.880
what if those two gangs join forces?

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.640
Tell our men

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.880
to keep a low profile for now.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.470
Until I get rid of that old fool

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.830
and secure my position as Chairman,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.470
they will pay back a hundred times

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.030
what they took from me.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.270
Miss,

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.070
has Xubu Huai agreed to break off the engagement?

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.510
I've thought it through.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.070
Calling off an engagement can't depend on others,

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.360
it must be up to me.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.120
The reason that my dad wants to marry me off

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.800
is his illness.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.910
But, what does that have to do

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.680
with your marriage?

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.030
Think about it,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.360
he's worried something might happen to him

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.640
and I'll be left all alone.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.950
If his illness can be cured,

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.030
and I play the sympathy card a couple of times,

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.240
I don't believe

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.640
he'd have the heart to marry off

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.360
his precious daughter.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:14:59.880
Indeed,

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.680

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:12.680
I won.

You are really smart,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.640

Young hero,

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.830
the last time I saw you,

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.510
you were still wearing that Chi You mask

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.800
and scamming food and drinks at the entrance of Chunyun House.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.640
How come just one day apart

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.000
and you've transformed completely

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.150
from a street performer to a miracle physician?

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.710
Never thought I'd leave such a lasting impression on you,

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.760
after just one brief meeting.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.320
Could it be

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.070
that you have taken a fancy to me?

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.240
I reckon,

next time you go out, young hero,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.830
maybe leave that Chi You mask at home.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:35.760
Why,

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.620

your skin is as thick as city walls,

Looks like the lady here is feeling shy.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.440
True.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.320
It's quite embarrassing

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.590
to expose someone's affection in public.

I'm not sick.

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:26.150
It's my brother who insisted I come.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.800
Miss,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.390
if you don't treat an illness,

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:30.240
it could lead to endless troubles.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:46.840
How is my sister doing?

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.790
Her pulse is steady,

muscles and veins strong,

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.760
except a bit physically weak

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.360
she has no other symptoms.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.000
So, that means,

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.080
she's not sick.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:58.880
But that doesn't make sense.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.360
I think the lady

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.240
must be suffering from sleeplessness and frequent dreams.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.880
That's why you look so haggard.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.150
There should be symptoms.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.360
I've already told you, I'm not sick.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.550
It's just too many trifles,

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:11.550
keeping me up at night.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.000
Then there must be some mistake.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.360
Jiangnan is known for its beauties.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.120
No wonder you are so beautiful.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.080
Do you remember when you came to Xichuan?

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.600
In the first year of Yongshou, on the seventh day of the ninth month.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.080
The seventh day of the ninth month,

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.240
which was thirteen years ago.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.080
You must be six or seven years old then.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.360
Five years old.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.670
Five years old?

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.960
After you arrived, Miss,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.760
what was the first meal you had?

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.670
How could she remember that?

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.190
It was flatbread, sheep's milk,

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.640
and some fruits.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.840
What fruits?

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.080
Grapes, pomegranates, melons.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.390
How many grapes did you eat?

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.670
Six.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.190
How many seeds did you spit out?

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.190
Fifteen.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.480
I...

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.600
Miss,

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:28.030
you are sick.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.310
What kind of sickness is that?

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.360
I once read in my master's medical book,

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.390
this illness is called 'Hyperthymesia'.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.000
It's when memories are too complex,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.360
making some hard to forget,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.000
thus causing sleepless nights.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:45.840
Can this disease be cured?

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.390
Now that we've known the cause, it's easier to deal with.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.030
The prescriptions are readily available.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:50.960
Here's what we'll do, Miss.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.880
I'll prescribe some sedatives for you,

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.880
and add some acupuncture therapy.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:55.760
You'll definitely recover.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:56.880
Then,

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:58.360
about the consultation fee...

00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:59.720
Forget the fee,

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.600
just treat us to a meal.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.240
We can even skip the meal.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.880
This disease is quite rare,

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.670
I'd like to see if the medicine works.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.550
That's not right,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.190
how can I have Physician Fu work for free?

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.190
I've got an idea.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.190
You're looking for Song Jingye, right?

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.000
I'll help you with that.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.880
Didn't you say

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.240
he's hard to approach?

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.600
I have a way.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.760
He always bullies my sister,

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.510
so I'll find a chance

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.600
to teach him a lesson.

If Hulu doesn't lie,

Song Jingye will be here today.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.240
This place...

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.270
Never been here before?

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.550
Well, I have,

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.840
but only to settle my father's accounts.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.840
Today, your big brother here will show you around.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.030
We just go in like this?

Follow me and you'll be fine.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.880
It's like coming home

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.120
Sir,

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.600
is this your first time in Xichuan?

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.670
This place was built by craftsmen

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.270
from Daqin hired by our boss.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.190
I'm confident that

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.880
it's one of the kind in the whole world.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.270
Interesting.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:40.760
Our Chunyun House,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.600
attracts officials, the wealthy, and gentlemen.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.030
Its scale,

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.080
certainly can't be matched by ordinary places.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.000
Naturally,

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.760
the price here...

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.240
is not something you find just anywhere.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.960
We're out of money.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.960

You should know,

I'm not here for tea.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.760
Yingying understands.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.000
But this is no small matter.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.800
I hope Chairman Song

can give Yingying some time to think.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.600
Could it be

that I haven't shown enough sincerity?

During our transport of the jades,

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:23.750
I fear

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.520
I can't protect this item.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.040
It might be better if we each kept one.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.950
Since you are loyal to the esteemed one,

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.710
you keep

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.470
this jade piece for him.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.470
As for the other two jades,

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.280
they are lost without a trace.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.800
You must know

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.120
where the Treasure of the Sealed Book is?

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.640
I do not.

Do you also seek the Treasure of the Sealed Book?

Yes.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.150
It was my father's dying wish.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:59.040
If the treasure

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.710
is found by those with bad intent,

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.190
it will surely lead to chaos,

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.840
and people will suffer greatly.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.560
Jibei Chamber of Commerce issued a reward

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.770
for this Bird Jade Plate.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.560
So, are you also looking for me?

That reward wasn't issued by me.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:19.950
It was Vice Chairman Li Zhizhuo.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.230
I fear he has some guys backing him,

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.230
perhaps the same people who killed your father.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.190
I can't give you the Cloud-shaped Jade just yet

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:42.600

I need to verify if what you said is true.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:45.640
Second,

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.430
I've found some clues recently.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.390
Maybe I can figure out who's behind this.

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:55.390
So, you stay in Xichuan for a few days.

Can you tell me,

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.320
who's the one behind all this?

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:22.320
That organization,

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.230
is called Breakwall.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:27.190

He told me some things from the past.

I also saw the Cloud-shaped jade.

Are you dumb?

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.520
He's just fooling you.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:32:59.360
What if he goes back,

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.880
and sends people for your jade?

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:02.670
He won't, will he?

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:03.880
