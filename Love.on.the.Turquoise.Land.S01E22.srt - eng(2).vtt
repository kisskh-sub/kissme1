(Cang Water)

00:04:09.738 --> 00:04:11.417
I lost track of days and nights.

00:04:11.858 --> 00:04:14.058
I completely forgot the date.

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:17.258
Chinese New Year
is in about ten more days.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.730
Good.

00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:28.011
Have a tangerine. Wish for good fortune.

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:31.530
Auspicious sign.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.571
Here, have one.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.970
Stop hanging in.

00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:42.090
I can beg Ms. Lin for mercy.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.011
Just tell her

00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:46.050
about your cooperation
with South Mountain Hunters

00:04:46.131 --> 00:04:47.891
and where Lin Ling went.

00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:50.891
Ms. Lin will soften up.

00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:55.905
Did she send you to persuade me?

00:04:57.066 --> 00:04:58.866
Why bother?

00:07:22.026 --> 00:07:23.346
He's so obedient.

00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:27.666
It seems promising.

00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:32.906
Hope we won't need to use him.

00:07:35.346 --> 00:07:36.505
Anyway,

00:07:37.185 --> 00:07:39.026
we'll find him a proper place.

00:07:42.505 --> 00:07:43.945
What kind of proper place?

00:07:45.786 --> 00:07:47.146
If Yuwang Meat

00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:49.706
enables positive gene fusion,

00:07:51.146 --> 00:07:52.985
it could also reverse the process.

00:07:53.745 --> 00:07:55.305
Then it is

00:07:57.865 --> 00:07:59.146
very useful.

He still retains his humanity.

00:09:06.226 --> 00:09:09.466
Just keep it till Chinese New Year.

00:09:10.346 --> 00:09:11.466

Your broth.

00:09:38.346 --> 00:09:39.426
Thank you.

00:09:40.385 --> 00:09:41.385
Seems you got used to it.

00:09:42.385 --> 00:09:43.946
I can't freeload forever.

00:09:43.946 --> 00:09:45.106
I should help somehow.

00:09:45.346 --> 00:09:47.106
Have you eaten?
Let me cook you dumplings.

00:09:47.106 --> 00:09:47.706
No need.

00:09:47.706 --> 00:09:49.106
I've eaten plenty here already.

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:51.265
I made these myself today.

00:09:51.385 --> 00:09:52.025
It's different.

00:09:54.426 --> 00:09:55.385
Come and chat.

00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:57.025
Go ahead.

00:10:01.186 --> 00:10:03.186
Lin Xirou has been searching for you.

00:10:03.905 --> 00:10:06.025
This place is well-hidden,

00:10:06.186 --> 00:10:07.745
but I can't guarantee absolute safety.

00:10:08.265 --> 00:10:08.946
So,

00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:11.265
I want you to be somewhere more secure.

00:10:17.385 --> 00:10:18.665
Can't I stay here?

00:10:30.826 --> 00:10:31.665
I'm sorry.

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:33.346
You just got settled.

00:10:34.145 --> 00:10:34.865
It's fine.

00:10:35.466 --> 00:10:37.546
I cause you trouble

00:10:37.546 --> 00:10:38.665
and make you worry.

00:10:40.505 --> 00:10:41.265
Besides,

00:10:41.745 --> 00:10:43.546
I'm used to hiding.

00:10:47.466 --> 00:10:48.226
Check please.

00:10:48.586 --> 00:10:49.226
Coming.

00:10:52.265 --> 00:10:53.145
20 yuan in total.

00:10:55.106 --> 00:10:56.306
Thanks. Take care.

00:10:56.985 --> 00:10:59.466
Ling, chop the scallions finer.

00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:00.385
Okay.

00:11:00.586 --> 00:11:01.226
Mr. Changxi.

00:11:01.226 --> 00:11:02.306
Miss Nie, you're here.

00:11:02.905 --> 00:11:04.226
How are you lately? Feeling well?

00:11:04.226 --> 00:11:05.025
All good.

00:11:05.946 --> 00:11:08.306
I came to discuss something with you.

00:11:08.586 --> 00:11:09.186
What is it?

00:11:10.426 --> 00:11:11.145
Lin Ling

00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:15.745
might need to stay here longer.

00:11:15.985 --> 00:11:17.186
I'd like to keep her company.

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:18.426
Do you mind?

00:11:18.946 --> 00:11:20.186
Why do I mind?

00:11:20.385 --> 00:11:21.466
No problem.

00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:22.226
Welcome.

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:23.865
Good you'd keep her company.

00:11:24.665 --> 00:11:25.985
Sorry for bothering you.

00:11:26.106 --> 00:11:26.665
Not at all.

00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:27.426
Mr. Liu.

00:11:27.426 --> 00:11:28.905
- Any leek dumplings?
- Degui.

00:11:29.145 --> 00:11:30.466
- Long time no see.
- Back from a business trip.

00:11:30.466 --> 00:11:31.066
Have a seat.

00:11:31.586 --> 00:11:32.385
Really?

00:11:34.385 --> 00:11:35.025
Don't worry.

00:11:35.466 --> 00:11:36.625
You're safe with me here.

00:11:39.745 --> 00:11:40.946
I'll go chop scallions then.

00:11:43.226 --> 00:11:44.025
Watch your fingers.

Chinese New Year?

00:16:06.786 --> 00:16:08.707
Chinese New Year's Eve is coming.

00:16:14.786 --> 00:16:15.627
Good.

00:16:17.627 --> 00:16:18.907
Good day.

00:16:20.866 --> 00:16:22.627
I love the Chinese New Year most.

00:16:23.907 --> 00:16:25.907
What an eventful year.

00:16:26.266 --> 00:16:27.506
Gou Ya was omnivorous.

00:16:28.586 --> 00:16:30.467
Han Guan and Chen Fu disappeared.

00:16:31.627 --> 00:16:33.306
South Mountain Hunters resurfaced.

00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:35.266
Four of our people got captured.

00:16:35.987 --> 00:16:38.066
Even the most obedient
Lin Ling ran away.

00:16:39.947 --> 00:16:42.866
Now you're the only one left
to spend Chinese New Year with me.

00:16:45.427 --> 00:16:48.066
Legend has it that long ago

00:16:49.707 --> 00:16:51.866
there was a monster called Nian.

00:16:52.987 --> 00:16:55.627
It loved devouring people
on Chinese New Year's Eve.

00:16:57.627 --> 00:17:01.667
But it feared fire, the color red,

00:17:03.627 --> 00:17:04.786
and firecrackers.

00:17:05.907 --> 00:17:08.187
So people set off firecrackers,

00:17:09.707 --> 00:17:12.707
posted red couplets,
and wore red clothes

00:17:13.707 --> 00:17:15.066
to drive it away.

00:17:16.147 --> 00:17:19.266
That's how we
celebrate Chinese New Year.

00:17:26.474 --> 00:17:27.315
Though

00:17:29.355 --> 00:17:31.674
I don't wear in red,

00:17:37.034 --> 00:17:38.794
I think your eyes

00:17:40.354 --> 00:17:42.314
are already red, right?

00:17:45.435 --> 00:17:47.755
I wish I could set off firecrackers

00:17:53.675 --> 00:17:55.274
to drive away

00:17:58.395 --> 00:17:59.715
all you monsters.

00:18:05.834 --> 00:18:08.314
This might be your
last dinner for Chinese New Year's Eve.

00:18:09.754 --> 00:18:11.635
Have some farewell dumplings.

00:18:26.634 --> 00:18:28.114
For my final journey,

00:18:29.753 --> 00:18:31.033
I don't need you to farewell me.

00:18:32.594 --> 00:18:33.394
Rest assured.

00:18:34.674 --> 00:18:37.914
I won't let you leave alone.

00:18:39.194 --> 00:18:41.473
I'll have all the South Mountain Hunters

00:18:41.914 --> 00:18:44.273
and that Mad Blade
who gave you the needle

00:18:44.713 --> 00:18:45.914
keep you company

00:18:46.513 --> 00:18:47.713
on your final journey.

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:08.298
The hunting hounds of that Hunter Tu

00:19:08.858 --> 00:19:10.777
accidentally ate Yuwang Meat

00:19:11.138 --> 00:19:12.537
and preyed on hares.

00:19:13.378 --> 00:19:14.537
After they died suddenly,

00:19:14.658 --> 00:19:18.618
they transformed beneath Turquoise Land
into creatures resembling

00:19:19.098 --> 00:19:21.257
both dogs and rabbits.

00:19:22.818 --> 00:19:25.418
This suggests the mysterious Yuwang Meat

00:19:26.658 --> 00:19:27.457
contains

00:19:27.457 --> 00:19:30.497
microorganisms that enable
stable genetic fusion.

00:19:34.618 --> 00:19:36.017
Yes, that's right.

00:19:36.658 --> 00:19:40.418
The structure of cell membranes
has changed.

00:19:40.858 --> 00:19:43.937
The cells merged

00:19:44.537 --> 00:19:48.818
the gene of both the spider
and the insects it ate

00:19:49.177 --> 00:19:50.618
and showed stability.

00:19:51.257 --> 00:19:52.378
This indicates

00:19:53.537 --> 00:19:55.497
Earth Fiends must be hybrid creations

00:19:55.497 --> 00:19:57.017
from cross-species genetic fusion

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.977
for their shady experiments.

00:20:00.298 --> 00:20:02.257
So, Roadsound Pharmaceuticals
acts as a front.

00:20:03.257 --> 00:20:05.697
With their resources and technology,

00:20:06.017 --> 00:20:08.937
they could fully exploit Yuwang Meat

00:20:09.257 --> 00:20:11.497
and transform Earth Fiends

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:12.858
into humans.

00:20:23.818 --> 00:20:26.217
I can always get good tea in your place.

00:20:27.858 --> 00:20:29.058
I'm flattered.

00:20:29.737 --> 00:20:30.298
You came

00:20:30.298 --> 00:20:32.017
when Wanbao Tower opened.

00:20:32.138 --> 00:20:33.338
And you brought your own tea.

00:20:36.697 --> 00:20:38.977
Sometimes, it's hard to distinguish

00:20:40.017 --> 00:20:42.217
what's mine and what's yours.

00:20:43.777 --> 00:20:46.578
Today I'm not sure

00:20:47.737 --> 00:20:48.898
if I should drink

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:50.697
the tea you offer here.

00:20:55.217 --> 00:20:55.898
Wait.

00:20:56.537 --> 00:20:57.898
What do you mean? I don't get it.

00:21:07.497 --> 00:21:10.058
You came, and then Lin Ling got injured.

00:21:10.818 --> 00:21:12.937
And you insisted on taking her here

00:21:13.537 --> 00:21:15.378
to handle her wound.

00:21:16.537 --> 00:21:19.618
Once you came, she was taken away.

00:21:21.177 --> 00:21:23.338
What a coincidence.

00:21:25.098 --> 00:21:26.338
By heaven's truth,

00:21:26.697 --> 00:21:28.058
you told me to get along well

00:21:28.058 --> 00:21:29.217
with Lin Ling.

00:21:29.578 --> 00:21:30.497
When she got hurt,

00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:31.818
I wasn't even there.

00:21:31.898 --> 00:21:33.457
It's Sis who was with her.

00:21:33.977 --> 00:21:36.497
That day she bled so much
and came for treatment.

00:21:36.497 --> 00:21:38.818
I focused on her wound

00:21:38.818 --> 00:21:39.658
all the time.

00:21:39.818 --> 00:21:41.818
And someone knocked me out,

00:21:42.138 --> 00:21:43.737
and twisted off

00:21:43.737 --> 00:21:44.658
my arm.

00:21:44.658 --> 00:21:45.858
I'm still in pain right now.

00:21:46.658 --> 00:21:47.338
Sorry.

00:21:59.497 --> 00:22:00.618
Last night at City Hospital,

00:22:00.618 --> 00:22:02.017
I vomited several times.

00:22:03.058 --> 00:22:05.138
The doctor said it might
be post-concussion syndrome.

00:22:05.737 --> 00:22:06.977
I am asked to stay longer.

00:22:08.058 --> 00:22:08.977
I said no.

00:22:09.618 --> 00:22:11.098
The Group might need me.

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:12.658
The buddies need...

00:22:14.058 --> 00:22:16.298
Hei, why didn't you tell Ms. Lin

00:22:16.298 --> 00:22:18.017
how I have treated you buddies normally?

00:22:18.257 --> 00:22:18.898
Tell her.

00:22:24.418 --> 00:22:25.898
I thought you'd

00:22:25.898 --> 00:22:27.098
at least say something like,

00:22:27.098 --> 00:22:28.418
"My child, you've suffered."

00:22:29.058 --> 00:22:30.298
Instead, you interrogated me.

00:22:45.058 --> 00:22:45.858
I see.

00:22:47.217 --> 00:22:49.217
I have to tell you the truth today.

00:22:55.098 --> 00:22:55.898
I have vile desires.

00:23:01.457 --> 00:23:03.298
My love for Lin Ling wasn't pure.

00:23:06.098 --> 00:23:07.378
I thought if we were married,

00:23:08.017 --> 00:23:09.177
I would strengthen our bonds,

00:23:09.977 --> 00:23:12.177
so I could secure
my position in the Group

00:23:12.777 --> 00:23:13.578
and earn more money.

00:23:14.977 --> 00:23:15.858
B-But if you think

00:23:15.858 --> 00:23:17.017
I don't like Lin Ling at all,

00:23:17.017 --> 00:23:18.017
that's not true.

00:23:18.737 --> 00:23:20.578
But she's not the one
I care about the most.

00:23:21.177 --> 00:23:21.937
It's you.

00:23:24.298 --> 00:23:26.737
Love can change in an instant,

00:23:27.818 --> 00:23:30.058
but Roadsound Group can stand forever.

00:23:48.017 --> 00:23:48.898
Don't worry, Ms. Lin.

00:23:49.697 --> 00:23:52.457
We'll keep close contact

00:23:52.737 --> 00:23:53.578
with Dr. Lv.

00:23:55.177 --> 00:23:57.818
I'll also station men at Wanbao Tower.

00:23:58.658 --> 00:24:00.697
If Lin Ling contacts Dr. Lv,

00:24:01.058 --> 00:24:04.177
we'll be the first he sees.

00:24:05.497 --> 00:24:06.578
My arm!

00:24:07.257 --> 00:24:08.098
No problem.

00:24:08.777 --> 00:24:10.378
My injury won't heal soon anyway.

00:24:10.497 --> 00:24:11.602
I won't open Wanbao Tower.

00:24:12.257 --> 00:24:13.737
Just focus on this.

00:24:50.642 --> 00:24:52.978
(Leisure Time Teahouse)

00:24:53.697 --> 00:24:55.177
Ling!

00:24:55.378 --> 00:24:56.737
Smash some cucumbers for me now.

00:24:56.737 --> 00:24:57.937
I'm too busy to do that.

00:24:58.298 --> 00:24:59.737
I've already served them.

00:25:03.818 --> 00:25:05.457
When I worked alone,

00:25:05.497 --> 00:25:06.578
I always needed more help.

00:25:06.578 --> 00:25:07.977
Now with two helpers,

00:25:08.098 --> 00:25:09.217
I'm still overwhelmed.

00:25:09.418 --> 00:25:11.418
Don't get used to it, Mr. Changxi.

00:25:11.497 --> 00:25:12.578
Once we all leave,

00:25:12.578 --> 00:25:13.658
you'll miss this.

00:25:13.737 --> 00:25:14.497
Exactly.

00:25:15.257 --> 00:25:16.697
Stay permanently then.

00:25:18.298 --> 00:25:19.937
Welcome. For how many people?

00:25:20.898 --> 00:25:21.457
One.

00:25:27.898 --> 00:25:28.697
Have a seat.

00:25:28.937 --> 00:25:29.658
Order anything?

00:25:29.937 --> 00:25:31.578
I'll handle this. You check the kitchen.

00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:33.658
Alright, you take over.

00:25:42.618 --> 00:25:44.338
I thought you're quite busy.

00:25:47.697 --> 00:25:49.858
Shan Qiang found some

00:25:50.138 --> 00:25:51.058
suspicious mines.

00:25:51.777 --> 00:25:53.537
We're investigating them now.

00:25:53.818 --> 00:25:55.058
We should get something.

00:26:03.497 --> 00:26:04.537
How suspicious?

00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:10.177
Roadsound Group evolved
from Roadsound Mining.

00:26:10.898 --> 00:26:13.618
Those private mines
should've been abandoned.

00:26:14.177 --> 00:26:16.217
But there are still
traces of people now.

00:26:16.697 --> 00:26:17.457
Therefore,

00:26:18.618 --> 00:26:19.537
something is wrong.

00:26:22.154 --> 00:26:23.034
Would it be

00:26:25.233 --> 00:26:26.953
where they're hiding Jiang and Yan Tuo?

00:26:28.634 --> 00:26:30.713
Not sure. We are still investigating.

00:26:38.154 --> 00:26:39.594
Xing Shen worries about you two,

00:26:39.794 --> 00:26:40.874
so he sent me to check.

00:26:43.394 --> 00:26:44.554
You came all this way

00:26:44.993 --> 00:26:46.154
just to tell me this?

00:26:48.114 --> 00:26:48.913
Of course not.

00:26:49.594 --> 00:26:51.074
Have a hearty meal as well.

00:26:52.273 --> 00:26:54.394
Beef scallion dumplings, please.

00:26:58.794 --> 00:27:00.433
Right away. Just a moment.

00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:07.394
(Changxi Dumplings)

00:27:07.394 --> 00:27:08.433
Lin Ling, let me.

00:27:08.473 --> 00:27:09.074
It's fine.

00:27:09.154 --> 00:27:09.834
This is dirty.

00:27:10.354 --> 00:27:11.993
Okay, I'll clean the table then.

00:27:18.114 --> 00:27:18.874
Go get some rest.

00:27:19.074 --> 00:27:19.834
Got it.

00:27:21.074 --> 00:27:21.834
It's a long day.

00:27:23.114 --> 00:27:24.354
You go rest as well.

00:27:30.322 --> 00:27:33.459
(Changxi Dumplings)

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.049
Had a nightmare?

00:30:38.474 --> 00:30:39.714
I'll get you some water.

00:30:40.313 --> 00:30:41.553
No need, Luo.

00:30:45.002 --> 00:30:45.681
Could you

00:30:48.042 --> 00:30:49.681
sleep here with me?

00:30:58.986 --> 00:31:05.770
(Changxi Dumplings)

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:07.170
Happy Chinese New Year.

00:31:07.449 --> 00:31:08.489
Happy Chinese New Year.

00:31:08.609 --> 00:31:09.730
You've brought the lanterns?

00:31:10.538 --> 00:31:11.410
(Open)

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.252
(Closed)

00:31:16.009 --> 00:31:17.210
Morning, Mr. Changxi.

00:31:17.569 --> 00:31:18.410
You're up.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.850
Wait here.

00:31:30.489 --> 00:31:32.170
Like Tuo, you're all kids

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:33.890
to me.

00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.730
Take this.

00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.730
(Blessing)
Lucky money.

00:31:42.449 --> 00:31:43.210
For good fortune.

00:31:45.009 --> 00:31:46.129
Thank you, Mr. Changxi.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:48.770
Tuo isn't here.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:50.810
You take it for him.

00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:53.170
Give it to him when you see him.

00:31:56.129 --> 00:31:57.370
Thanks, Mr. Changxi.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:59.290
It's Chinese New Year,

00:31:59.449 --> 00:32:00.569
so let's be cheerful.

00:32:02.609 --> 00:32:05.449
This is my first time
receiving lucky money.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.250
Since I opened this shop,

00:32:11.569 --> 00:32:14.449
this is the first time someone has
celebrated Chinese New Year with me.

00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:16.770
Don't just stand there.

00:32:17.089 --> 00:32:19.290
I bought lots of nuts
and candies yesterday.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.210
Check the bedroom for the snack tray.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.290
I think it's on top of that big cabinet.

00:32:23.649 --> 00:32:25.129
Got it, we'll handle it, Mr. Changxi.

00:32:25.529 --> 00:32:26.009
Let's go.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:39.529
Here.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:48.609
Be careful.

00:32:53.489 --> 00:32:55.770
Look, this is Mr. Changxi
when he was young.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:57.170
He looked so energetic.

00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:59.609
He is still energetic now.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:01.690
He used to have delicate features.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.730
Now he looks benevolent.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.410
Let's put it back.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:10.410
Where should we put it?

00:33:10.969 --> 00:33:12.250
(Roadsound Mining)
Many photos!

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:16.410
Here, I guess.

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:25.290
Did you find it?

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:26.649
Mr. Changxi,

00:33:26.649 --> 00:33:27.330
we accidentally

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.330
saw your old photos from younger days.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.129
Mr. Changxi,

00:33:31.569 --> 00:33:32.730
who's this person?

00:33:33.449 --> 00:33:34.210
Let me see.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.850
These were my mining coworkers
back then.

00:33:37.089 --> 00:33:39.129
We were all wearing uniforms.

00:33:40.489 --> 00:33:42.129
Let me check
how many years ago this was.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:47.330
Quanshun, Zhang Guangdong,
Li Yunxiang, Dalieba,

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.049
and this is Li Ergou.

00:33:50.009 --> 00:33:50.649
He

00:33:50.649 --> 00:33:51.770
got along well with us,

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.170
but he had sticky fingers.

00:33:53.489 --> 00:33:55.449
He stole mining company's
money and ran off.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.089
Tuo's father was kind-hearted.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:33:59.290
He didn't punish him,

00:33:59.529 --> 00:34:01.290
and took pity on his poor family

00:34:01.529 --> 00:34:04.330
and hired his sister as a housekeeper.

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:07.330
A woman

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:09.649
ruined my family.

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:12.410
She even stole my mother's name.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:14.129
(Lin Xirou)
Lin Xirou

00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:17.210
is in charge
of the entire Roadsound Group,

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:18.569
and living carefree.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.609
So Li Ergou's sister

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:27.129
was the housekeeper
in Yan Tuo's family later?

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:27.969
Yes, that's her.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:28.929
Li Shuangxiu.

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:32.290
She was quite pretty,

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.410
but lacked integrity.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:35.529
Later, because of her,

00:34:36.609 --> 00:34:38.250
Tuo's family's fate has changed.

00:34:46.058 --> 00:34:47.994
After making all these efforts,

00:34:48.074 --> 00:34:49.674
we found nothing.

00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:51.034
I'm starving.

00:34:52.434 --> 00:34:53.154
And you?

00:34:55.034 --> 00:34:56.154
Only two sites are left.

00:34:56.954 --> 00:34:57.794
Work harder,

00:34:58.554 --> 00:34:59.714
and we'll finish tomorrow.

00:35:05.434 --> 00:35:07.274
Bid farewell to the old year with vigor,

00:35:07.474 --> 00:35:09.394
and welcome the new year joyfully!

00:35:11.834 --> 00:35:14.234
On this Chinese New Year,

00:35:14.754 --> 00:35:16.714
I hereby represent...

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:18.474
Stop that.

00:35:19.354 --> 00:35:20.994
You really scared me!

00:35:21.074 --> 00:35:22.314
I almost smashed you.

00:35:22.474 --> 00:35:23.434
We have already eaten.

00:35:24.514 --> 00:35:25.194
But...

00:35:26.826 --> 00:35:31.210
♪Heaven-sent tides can't
quench this reckless fire♪

00:35:33.554 --> 00:35:34.234
Dumplings.

00:35:38.674 --> 00:35:39.874
Shen told us

00:35:39.874 --> 00:35:41.274
to save these for you two.

00:35:41.274 --> 00:35:42.114
Come on, eat up!
