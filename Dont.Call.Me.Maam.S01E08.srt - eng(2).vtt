(This drama is a work of fiction.
Names and contents of people, places,)

00:00:29.126 --> 00:00:30.127
(organizations, events, and backgrounds
are not related to real life.)

00:00:30.127 --> 00:00:31.128
(Child actors filmed under guardian
supervision in a safe environment.)

00:00:33.697 --> 00:00:39.069
(2019)

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.706
I've been trying it at home,
and the coverage is really amazing.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.308
And it doesn't transfer.

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:46.644
How is it?

00:00:46.644 --> 00:00:48.712
Moms really hate looking shiny,

00:00:48.712 --> 00:00:49.747
and this stays matte.

00:00:50.214 --> 00:00:51.915
It even feels nice and cooling.

00:00:51.915 --> 00:00:54.184
I think it'd be good if Ye Na and I
take turns doing the demo.

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:57.021
Producer Noh.

00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:57.888
Yes?

00:00:57.888 --> 00:01:00.557
I'm only saying this because
it's your first time handling cosmetics.

00:01:00.557 --> 00:01:03.427
This much is a top tier finish
and coverage.

00:01:05.062 --> 00:01:06.463
Ye Na, how was it for you?

00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:08.265
I think it's great.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.235
You have dry skin, right?

00:01:11.235 --> 00:01:12.703
How long does it last?

00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:15.205
How long was it again?

00:01:19.977 --> 00:01:21.545
Seriously?

00:01:24.548 --> 00:01:26.250
Why do you keep staring at me like that?

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.085
Is something bothering you, Producer Noh?

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:30.120
Well,

00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:34.658
are you not sleeping well
these days, Ms. Cho?

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.827
Sorry?

00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:39.430
Why do you have
so many bumps on your face?

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:43.200
They're pimples. Okay.

00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:49.773
I guess you like being blunt.

00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:53.110
So this makes it perfect
for showing off the coverage, right?

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.011
Here, look.

00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:55.479
Here's the before,

00:01:57.348 --> 00:01:58.983
and the after.

00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:08.092
No.

00:02:08.492 --> 00:02:09.827
Instead of the demo,

00:02:10.394 --> 00:02:12.930
let's build the segment
around the special bonuses and gifts.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.699
This main product alone
is 75 dollars at the department store,

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.969
but this package includes two refills,
concealer, essence, and facial mist.

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.204
Listen, Producer Noh.

00:02:20.704 --> 00:02:23.741
The biggest strength
of Perfect Cushion is its coverage.

00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:26.810
It's already been proven in blind tests,
and I've tried it myself.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.014
And above all, showing the demo...

00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:32.683
is the best way to grab
the viewers' attention...

00:02:33.517 --> 00:02:34.418
I'm not sure.

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.188
If that gets caught on camera,

00:02:38.188 --> 00:02:39.890
they're going to look
way bigger than you think.

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.926
The pimples.

00:02:45.162 --> 00:02:48.165
Anyway, since the configuration
is this product's strength,

00:02:48.165 --> 00:02:49.767
let's just do it my way.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.336
What a jerk.

00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:56.373
He's so annoying.

00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:59.343
Why pick on someone's looks?
Unbelievable.

00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.547
Still, I heard he was a promising producer
back at Our Home Shopping.

00:03:04.615 --> 00:03:06.550
And he's good-looking.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.819
Good-looking? Says who?

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.689
Just because someone's good-looking,
they get to be rude?

00:03:12.957 --> 00:03:16.360
It's still way better
than some ugly guy being rude.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.194
Wait.

00:03:17.528 --> 00:03:19.463
Did you even try the product?

00:03:20.631 --> 00:03:22.666
Of course, I did.
You did too, right?

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.436
Then why couldn't you answer
when I asked about wear time?

00:03:28.572 --> 00:03:30.107
How many times have I told you?

00:03:30.107 --> 00:03:31.742
You always have to study the product...

00:03:31.742 --> 00:03:33.811
and make it your own before going on air.

00:03:34.178 --> 00:03:36.513
You can't just rely on the producer
spoon-feeding you everything.

00:03:37.114 --> 00:03:38.215
Actually...

00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:39.249
Forget it.

00:03:42.987 --> 00:03:44.355
This is driving me crazy.

00:03:44.355 --> 00:03:47.524
Why do these always come up
every time I ovulate?

00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:49.226
Hello, everyone.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.564
Bringing you the most perfect
Perfect Cushion package,

00:03:53.564 --> 00:03:55.399
I'm your show host, Cho Na Jeong.

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:57.368
And I'm show host Song Ye Na.

00:03:57.368 --> 00:03:58.802
Today,

00:03:58.802 --> 00:04:01.739
we're introducing a product
everyone's talking about.

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.073
Perfect Cushion!

00:04:03.073 --> 00:04:05.142
It doesn't transfer.

00:04:05.142 --> 00:04:07.344
As for coverage,

00:04:07.344 --> 00:04:09.280
it ranked number one in blind testing.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.514
Start with the package.

00:04:10.948 --> 00:04:13.951
Let me walk you through the package.

00:04:14.218 --> 00:04:17.554
This is the exact same product
currently sold at department stores.

00:04:17.554 --> 00:04:21.258
The cushion that sells for 75 dollars
at department stores,

00:04:21.258 --> 00:04:22.926
and from Perfect,

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:25.262
something they really rarely ever include,

00:04:25.262 --> 00:04:27.765
the antioxidant essence base,

00:04:27.765 --> 00:04:30.601
plus two refills and a concealer,

00:04:30.868 --> 00:04:31.969
and you also get a facial mist.

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:33.237
And for all that?

00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:36.307
For all that, 79.90 dollars.

00:04:36.307 --> 00:04:39.310
Yes, can you believe it?

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.811
Please show the demo.

00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:43.047
- Show the coverage, please.
- This package, at this price?

00:04:43.047 --> 00:04:45.616
A groundbreaking package...

00:04:45.616 --> 00:04:46.951
first introduced here
on Sweet Home Shopping.

00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:48.719
The lines are good. Now show the demo.

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:49.553
What the...

00:04:49.553 --> 00:04:51.422
He told me not to do demos in the meeting.

00:04:51.422 --> 00:04:54.358
Okay, let me show you the case.

00:04:54.591 --> 00:04:55.826
First of all,

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:59.563
we've gotten so many compliments
on how pretty the case is.

00:04:59.563 --> 00:05:01.031
Isn't it so sleek?

00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:03.167
Now, when you open it,

00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:04.268
there's the puff.

00:05:04.268 --> 00:05:06.604
Now it's showtime.

00:05:06.604 --> 00:05:08.439
This magical coverage,

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.642
you won't believe it
unless we show you live.

00:05:11.642 --> 00:05:13.077
That pimple is too big.

00:05:13.077 --> 00:05:14.745
Ms. Song should do it, not you.

00:05:14.745 --> 00:05:17.348
Ye Na, could you demonstrate as well?

00:05:17.348 --> 00:05:18.649
Sure.

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:20.985
Let me show you...

00:05:20.985 --> 00:05:22.786
how much brighter the skin tone looks.

00:05:23.087 --> 00:05:25.189
Say something. Don't just do the demo.

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:26.890
You have to explain features
and ingredients too.

00:05:27.858 --> 00:05:28.726
Okay.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.196
Look, both sides look
completely different, right?

00:05:32.496 --> 00:05:35.199
We're having trouble
connecting callers right now.

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.068
Please use the app
or the automated order line.

00:05:38.068 --> 00:05:39.670
Now, moving to CTA video.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.405
Video 3, cut.

00:05:46.644 --> 00:05:47.578
Producer Noh.

00:05:47.878 --> 00:05:49.680
If the plan changed,
you should request it.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.881
Why do you talk like that?

00:05:52.082 --> 00:05:53.717
Calls are pouring in. Please focus.

00:05:53.717 --> 00:05:54.652
Okay, focus.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.721
Camera 1, standby.

00:05:59.556 --> 00:06:00.357
Cue!

00:06:02.993 --> 00:06:04.128
Everyone.

00:06:04.128 --> 00:06:07.564
Over 10,000 people
have already placed their orders.

00:06:07.564 --> 00:06:11.435
This package is only available
during this broadcast,

00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:14.138
so you'll really regret missing it.

00:06:14.138 --> 00:06:16.173
Try it today.

00:06:16.173 --> 00:06:18.375
Your skin will change.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.511
Sold out.

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:27.584
You didn't forget
about this week's team dinner, right?

00:06:28.686 --> 00:06:29.687
Producer Noh.

00:06:29.954 --> 00:06:31.956
Why do you talk to people that way?

00:06:31.956 --> 00:06:34.124
Don't you know the hosts get thrown off
when you talk like that?

00:06:34.124 --> 00:06:35.960
You say no demos,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.561
then you order a demo again?

00:06:37.561 --> 00:06:40.197
At least explain why.

00:06:40.197 --> 00:06:43.601
How can I explain everything
in the little time we have?

00:06:44.068 --> 00:06:45.502
And shouldn't a show host...

00:06:45.502 --> 00:06:47.905
be flexible enough to adapt on the spot?

00:06:47.905 --> 00:06:50.841
Is this how you've always run
your shows, Producer Noh?

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:52.943
We sold out.

00:06:52.943 --> 00:06:55.312
Why make such a big deal out of nothing?

00:06:55.312 --> 00:06:57.114
Nothing?

00:06:57.114 --> 00:06:59.516
Let go of me.

00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:02.019
Look here, Producer Noh Won Bin.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.622
Do you think a shopping host...

00:07:04.622 --> 00:07:06.156
is just a parrot
repeating whatever you say?

00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:08.192
And you call yourself a pro?

00:07:08.192 --> 00:07:09.927
Really?

00:07:09.927 --> 00:07:12.630
Say something.
Talk like you did earlier.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.531
Cat got your tongue
now that I set the stage for you?

00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:17.501
Go on.
Talk like earlier, you piece of garbage.

00:07:27.478 --> 00:07:28.345
Stop.

00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:43.327
Ms. Cho, I'm sorry.

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:47.865
The truth is,
I've only been a producer for three years.

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:51.635
People around me said I needed
to establish dominance early on,

00:07:52.803 --> 00:07:54.204
so I overstepped.

00:07:56.473 --> 00:07:57.675
I'm really sorry.

00:07:58.609 --> 00:07:59.576
Producer Noh.

00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:03.280
When a show host is on stage,

00:08:03.547 --> 00:08:06.417
it feels like they're standing...

00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:10.220
in the middle of an eight-lane highway
wearing nothing but a bikini.

00:08:10.754 --> 00:08:13.824
And if you put them on the spot there,

00:08:13.824 --> 00:08:15.526
imagine how lonely they'd feel.

00:08:18.729 --> 00:08:21.332
Ms. Cho, I...

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:24.468
I'm sorry, Ms. Cho.

00:08:27.204 --> 00:08:28.806
Seriously.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.377
Anyway, I'm also sorry...

00:08:33.377 --> 00:08:35.479
for calling you a piece of garbage.

00:08:36.213 --> 00:08:37.147
No.

00:08:37.848 --> 00:08:39.383
I am a piece of garbage. Yes, I am.

00:08:39.383 --> 00:08:41.151
I'm a total piece of garbage.

00:09:01.272 --> 00:09:03.574
Wait, why is he handsome?

00:09:05.476 --> 00:09:08.112
You're really handsome.

00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:11.382
You actually are.

00:09:15.853 --> 00:09:16.987
Where do you live?

00:09:18.122 --> 00:09:18.989
Ms. Cho.

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:23.994
Ms. Cho, where do you live?

00:09:25.496 --> 00:09:26.497
Nowhere.

00:09:26.497 --> 00:09:28.565
You can't stay here.

00:09:28.565 --> 00:09:31.635
We both have work tomorrow.

00:09:31.635 --> 00:09:33.938
So tell me. Where do you live?

00:09:34.571 --> 00:09:37.975
I don't have a home.
I'm garbage, remember?

00:09:37.975 --> 00:09:40.177
I already told you I'm the garbage.

00:09:40.177 --> 00:09:40.978
Right.

00:09:40.978 --> 00:09:44.581
But seriously, if you stay here like this,
you're going to get in trouble.

00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:46.917
Where do you live? Your place.

00:09:48.018 --> 00:09:49.453
- My place?
- Yes.

00:09:51.088 --> 00:09:52.022
My place...

00:09:52.523 --> 00:09:53.557
is right there!

00:09:53.557 --> 00:09:54.425
Where?

00:09:55.426 --> 00:09:56.493
(Hotel)

00:09:57.194 --> 00:09:57.962
What?

00:09:57.962 --> 00:09:59.730
You're garbage, Cho Na Jeong.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.432
That place over there is my home!

00:10:01.432 --> 00:10:03.400
Be careful.
You're going to get into trouble that way.

00:10:08.238 --> 00:10:09.807
Let's get into big trouble.

00:10:10.708 --> 00:10:11.909
Catch me if you can.

00:10:12.843 --> 00:10:14.011
Seriously?

00:10:14.578 --> 00:10:16.513
Why are you doing this to me?

00:10:17.114 --> 00:10:18.315
Your bag is right here.

00:10:18.716 --> 00:10:20.484
Na Jeong, wait for me.

00:10:22.953 --> 00:10:24.855
You already caught me.

00:10:26.323 --> 00:10:30.861
(Hotel)

00:10:39.737 --> 00:10:45.542
(Intensive Care Unit)

00:10:48.012 --> 00:10:50.481
(Executive Director Seo Gyeong Seon)

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.817
Yes?

00:10:53.817 --> 00:10:55.886
Won Bin, I heard the news.

00:10:55.886 --> 00:10:57.421
She still hasn't woken up?

00:10:57.421 --> 00:10:59.223
But she's not in critical danger, right?

00:10:59.857 --> 00:11:01.191
Yes, it seems that way.

00:11:03.227 --> 00:11:04.762
Anyway, thank you for all your work.

00:11:05.195 --> 00:11:08.465
And I'm telling you this so you don't
go around saying something you shouldn't.

00:11:08.465 --> 00:11:10.768
This is no one's fault.

00:11:10.768 --> 00:11:11.635
Understand?

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:16.941
No.

00:11:17.808 --> 00:11:18.842
It's my fault.

00:11:21.312 --> 00:11:23.113
If I hadn't pulled out at the end,

00:11:23.113 --> 00:11:24.615
it wouldn't have gotten this bad.

00:11:26.817 --> 00:11:28.185
I looked away just to save myself,

00:11:29.753 --> 00:11:31.755
to protect my own family.

00:11:37.094 --> 00:11:38.429
It's all my fault.

00:11:53.777 --> 00:11:54.678
Honey.

00:11:55.312 --> 00:11:56.413
What's going on?

00:11:57.247 --> 00:11:58.582
So did she die?

00:12:00.451 --> 00:12:01.418
Damn it.

00:12:04.488 --> 00:12:05.689
She didn't die, right?

00:12:06.256 --> 00:12:07.124
Right?

00:12:07.891 --> 00:12:09.560
Damn it.

00:12:14.365 --> 00:12:16.567
Be honest.

00:12:17.901 --> 00:12:20.904
Did you contact Kim Seon Min after that?

00:12:20.904 --> 00:12:22.273
What are you talking about?

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.575
Never! I swear!

00:12:26.577 --> 00:12:28.212
I told you already.

00:12:28.812 --> 00:12:30.981
She wasn't the victim, but I was.

00:12:31.448 --> 00:12:32.516
Then what about Song Ye Na?

00:12:35.352 --> 00:12:36.353
No.

00:12:36.353 --> 00:12:37.588
Be honest!

00:12:37.588 --> 00:12:39.923
I said no! I didn't!

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.094
Listen carefully, Kim Jeong Sik.

00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:48.866
The reason I haven't divorced
a bastard like you...

00:12:48.866 --> 00:12:50.834
is not because I trust you
or care about you.

00:12:52.169 --> 00:12:53.370
It's because I don't want
trash like you...

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.706
to leave a stain on my career,

00:12:55.706 --> 00:12:58.309
and because I refuse to let
my daughter's life get ruined.

00:12:59.677 --> 00:13:02.112
So if you pull even one reckless stunt,

00:13:02.112 --> 00:13:03.948
before the law judges you,

00:13:05.683 --> 00:13:06.917
I'm going to kill you myself.

00:13:08.452 --> 00:13:09.386
Do you hear me?

00:13:10.854 --> 00:13:11.889
Damn it.

00:13:29.773 --> 00:13:30.774
You scared me.

00:13:32.543 --> 00:13:33.510
What are you doing here?

00:13:41.151 --> 00:13:42.653
You reek of alcohol.

00:13:43.587 --> 00:13:45.289
Why did you drink so much?

00:13:45.956 --> 00:13:46.824
Hey.

00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:52.096
Deputy Editor?

00:13:54.999 --> 00:13:57.301
Hi, Deputy Editor!
What a surprise running into you here.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.672
This is my usual spot.

00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:04.441
Manager Eom must've brought you here.

00:14:05.709 --> 00:14:06.710
Let's go somewhere else.

00:14:08.712 --> 00:14:10.881
Let's just sit here.

00:14:10.881 --> 00:14:12.316
Come here.

00:14:14.018 --> 00:14:15.986
It's okay if we sit here, right?

00:14:16.487 --> 00:14:17.588
I said let's go somewhere else.

00:14:18.088 --> 00:14:19.256
No.

00:14:19.256 --> 00:14:20.991
Why should we go somewhere else?

00:14:24.561 --> 00:14:25.396
Hey.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.299
Is she the one who had an affair
with Eom Jong Do?

00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:30.301
Yeah.

00:14:30.868 --> 00:14:32.303
That bitch.

00:14:35.072 --> 00:14:36.974
You must be her friends.

00:14:36.974 --> 00:14:38.976
We came to see an exhibit nearby,

00:14:38.976 --> 00:14:40.177
and heard this place was a hot spot.

00:14:41.211 --> 00:14:42.680
But Deputy Editor,

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.982
you didn't lose your mood
because of us, right?

00:14:45.849 --> 00:14:46.917
Of course not.

00:14:47.952 --> 00:14:51.655
"Blunt Sister's Sensible Advice"
is so fun these days.

00:14:51.655 --> 00:14:53.090
Especially that one...

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.459
where the show hosts appeared
and spilled everything.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.695
Was that your idea?

00:14:58.262 --> 00:14:59.196
Yes.

00:14:59.663 --> 00:15:01.065
See?

00:15:01.065 --> 00:15:03.500
This is why I can't bring myself
to fire our deputy editor.

00:15:07.404 --> 00:15:10.207
I was joking.
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:15:11.875 --> 00:15:12.743
But who's this?

00:15:15.346 --> 00:15:17.514
Your new boyfriend?

00:15:17.915 --> 00:15:18.782
Yes.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.218
Nice to meet you.

00:15:21.218 --> 00:15:24.922
I'm Il Ri's new boyfriend, Byeon Sang Gyu.

00:15:28.192 --> 00:15:30.761
Judging by the vibe,
you're Il Ri's coworkers.

00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:31.762
Right?

00:15:31.762 --> 00:15:32.563
Yes.

00:15:33.797 --> 00:15:34.765
What would you like to have?

00:15:34.999 --> 00:15:36.033
Tonight, it's all on me.

00:15:36.033 --> 00:15:38.402
As a way of asking you
to be nice to Il Ri.

00:15:38.802 --> 00:15:40.904
Excuse me, could we get the menu here?

00:15:42.239 --> 00:15:44.808
Your new boyfriend is so cool,
Deputy Editor.

00:15:44.808 --> 00:15:45.609
The best.

00:15:45.843 --> 00:15:47.878
Then we can order
something expensive, right?

00:15:47.878 --> 00:15:49.113
Of course.

00:15:49.113 --> 00:15:50.848
Just order whatever you want.

00:15:52.016 --> 00:15:52.983
Okay.

00:15:56.587 --> 00:15:57.554
Wait, Il Ri.

00:15:58.222 --> 00:15:59.056
Come here a sec.

00:16:00.224 --> 00:16:03.460
Why is your face so red?
Are you not feeling well?

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.296
- No...
- Hold still.

00:16:08.632 --> 00:16:10.801
You're burning up.

00:16:10.801 --> 00:16:11.669
No, I'm...

00:16:11.669 --> 00:16:13.604
Are you okay, baby?

00:16:14.905 --> 00:16:16.407
I don't want you to get sick.

00:16:34.024 --> 00:16:35.025
This is embarrassing.

00:16:35.359 --> 00:16:37.494
I was blushing like crazy.

00:16:38.262 --> 00:16:40.130
What is Sang Gyu thinking?

00:16:41.031 --> 00:16:43.233
Whatever. I'll just play along for now.

00:16:44.001 --> 00:16:45.903
It'd be weird to suddenly say
it was a lie.

00:16:51.942 --> 00:16:52.943
Be honest.

00:16:53.877 --> 00:16:55.079
He's not really your boyfriend, is he?

00:16:55.779 --> 00:16:56.647
Why do you care?

00:16:57.681 --> 00:16:59.717
People say tastes change with age.

00:16:59.717 --> 00:17:02.086
So do you like someone local
and old-fashioned now?

00:17:02.086 --> 00:17:04.054
My taste used to be pretty terrible.

00:17:04.555 --> 00:17:06.190
I'm just trying to upgrade.

00:17:08.192 --> 00:17:09.426
We need to talk.

00:17:09.727 --> 00:17:11.095
I have nothing to say, so get lost.

00:17:12.129 --> 00:17:13.731
I said let's talk.

00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:15.332
- Let go!
- Il Ri.

00:17:16.767 --> 00:17:18.869
What do you think you're doing
to my girlfriend?

00:17:21.305 --> 00:17:22.206
Let go of me.

00:17:24.141 --> 00:17:25.309
I said let go.

00:17:31.382 --> 00:17:32.216
Hey.

00:17:33.851 --> 00:17:35.185
The past is the past.

00:17:36.553 --> 00:17:38.355
It's already over between you two,
isn't it?

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.525
Aren't you ashamed
in front of your current girlfriend?

00:17:47.431 --> 00:17:48.265
Damn it.

00:17:57.274 --> 00:17:58.142
Let's go.

00:17:58.642 --> 00:17:59.710
Honey, where are you going?

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.612
- Come.
- Honey.

00:18:01.946 --> 00:18:02.846
Eom Jong Do.

00:18:03.981 --> 00:18:05.916
He's so annoying.

00:18:08.118 --> 00:18:09.987
Those guys.

00:18:10.287 --> 00:18:12.790
Look at all this food they ordered
that they're not even going to eat.

00:18:34.678 --> 00:18:35.946
Right.

00:18:35.946 --> 00:18:37.982
I need to make a quick call.

00:18:37.982 --> 00:18:39.550
Do you guys want to go first?

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.085
Go on, I'll be right behind you.

00:18:41.085 --> 00:18:41.986
Hey!

00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:44.321
We'll wait for you.
Come when you're done.

00:18:50.728 --> 00:18:52.830
Do you want to sit on that bench
for a bit while we wait?

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.531
Yes.

00:18:54.531 --> 00:18:55.366
Over there.

00:19:15.152 --> 00:19:16.587
Thanks for today, dude.

00:19:18.088 --> 00:19:19.690
I didn't do anything.

00:19:20.424 --> 00:19:21.492
He seemed strange.

00:19:23.127 --> 00:19:25.629
But still,
you pretended to be my boyfriend...

00:19:25.629 --> 00:19:27.064
when you like someone else.

00:19:28.999 --> 00:19:29.767
Pretended?

00:19:31.969 --> 00:19:35.239
That sounds kind of sad.

00:19:36.006 --> 00:19:37.975
Why? It's true.

00:19:38.742 --> 00:19:40.978
I feel sorry for whoever it is.

00:19:42.179 --> 00:19:43.314
Did you tell her how you feel?

00:19:44.548 --> 00:19:45.349
No.

00:19:46.483 --> 00:19:47.318
Why not?

00:19:48.352 --> 00:19:52.289
I just feel like I need some time.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.024
For what?

00:19:56.126 --> 00:19:58.595
I need time to think...

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.533
about what I should say
to best express my feelings.

00:20:04.902 --> 00:20:05.936
Lucky her.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.805
You're so serious.

00:20:08.405 --> 00:20:09.940
Who is it? Someone I know?

00:20:16.347 --> 00:20:17.181
Hey.

00:20:18.415 --> 00:20:20.851
Do you really not know,
or are you pretending not to know?

00:20:24.254 --> 00:20:25.389
You knew...

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:27.925
I liked you.

00:20:28.926 --> 00:20:30.027
And you know...

00:20:31.128 --> 00:20:33.797
I still like you.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.370
It's been 20 years
since we met again like this, right?

00:20:41.772 --> 00:20:42.973
It's crazy.

00:20:45.042 --> 00:20:45.943
Are you...

00:20:47.678 --> 00:20:48.712
Lee Il Ri?

00:20:52.816 --> 00:20:53.550
Hey.

00:20:55.986 --> 00:20:58.155
Hey, are you okay?

00:20:58.789 --> 00:21:00.491
The moment I saw you that day,

00:21:01.025 --> 00:21:03.594
it felt like I'd gotten in a time machine.

00:21:04.295 --> 00:21:05.729
I knew right away.

00:21:08.232 --> 00:21:09.300
In my whole life,

00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:12.503
I'd never liked anyone
as much as I liked you.

00:21:16.206 --> 00:21:17.541
Unbelievable.

00:21:20.644 --> 00:21:24.014
I wanted to confess to you
in a really cool way,

00:21:25.249 --> 00:21:26.150
but I failed.

00:21:29.186 --> 00:21:31.055
Since it's already come to this,
I guess there's nothing we can do.

00:21:36.226 --> 00:21:37.061
Il Ri.

00:21:39.663 --> 00:21:40.564
How about you?

00:21:41.799 --> 00:21:42.733
What do you think of me?

00:21:45.603 --> 00:21:48.639
How about dating me?

00:21:53.177 --> 00:21:54.578
You don't want to?

00:22:00.117 --> 00:22:01.485
It's not exactly that.

00:22:01.485 --> 00:22:03.687
Then what's making you hesitate?

00:22:08.759 --> 00:22:09.693
It's just...

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:13.764
No.

00:22:14.832 --> 00:22:16.433
You don't have to answer right now.

00:22:17.301 --> 00:22:19.403
Take your time and think it over,

00:22:22.473 --> 00:22:23.807
and maybe feel a little pressure too.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.054
What's that?

00:22:44.128 --> 00:22:45.796
Should we ride this back home?

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.739
I can't believe it.
Sang Gyu is such a macho man.

00:22:56.206 --> 00:22:58.609
Hey, come to think of it,

00:22:58.609 --> 00:23:01.045
I remembered how Sang Gyu was
always looking out just for you...

00:23:01.045 --> 00:23:02.680
back in college.

00:23:03.547 --> 00:23:04.615
What's with that face?

00:23:04.949 --> 00:23:05.950
Is something wrong?

00:23:07.084 --> 00:23:08.218
I don't know.

00:23:08.719 --> 00:23:10.387
What do you mean, you don't know?

00:23:10.654 --> 00:23:12.122
Don't tell me you don't like Sang Gyu.

00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:15.693
It's not like that.

00:23:19.163 --> 00:23:20.197
(Eom Jong Do)

00:23:20.197 --> 00:23:22.700
Why is this punk calling
in the middle of the night?

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:23.901
Pick up.

00:23:25.636 --> 00:23:26.470
What?

00:23:27.104 --> 00:23:28.839
Put it on speaker.

00:23:31.342 --> 00:23:32.276
Il Ri.

00:23:32.643 --> 00:23:34.278
How could you change like that so fast?

00:23:35.079 --> 00:23:36.513
Was that really all
our relationship meant to you?

00:23:37.548 --> 00:23:38.849
What are you even talking about right now?

00:23:39.283 --> 00:23:41.051
I still like you, Il Ri.

00:23:42.686 --> 00:23:44.922
I felt like crap
the whole way over to my place.

00:23:44.922 --> 00:23:47.191
After I saw that guy last time,
I couldn't even sleep.

00:23:47.191 --> 00:23:48.292
I kept wondering why I was like that,

00:23:49.827 --> 00:23:52.096
and then I realized.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:53.764
I'm really sorry,

00:23:55.332 --> 00:23:56.734
but I still love you, Il Ri.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.139
I know I've messed up.

00:24:02.873 --> 00:24:05.342
But it wasn't that I didn't like you.

00:24:05.342 --> 00:24:06.977
I was scared of getting married.

00:24:07.645 --> 00:24:10.214
I was crushed by the weight of having
to take responsibility for someone,

00:24:10.214 --> 00:24:12.850
so I ran away like a coward.

00:24:14.118 --> 00:24:16.020
But that happens, right?

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.755
People do that sometimes,

00:24:17.755 --> 00:24:18.622
right?

00:24:18.622 --> 00:24:19.857
Sure, it happens.

00:24:20.591 --> 00:24:22.993
But a guy who actually does that...

00:24:22.993 --> 00:24:24.795
really is a total bastard.

00:24:25.763 --> 00:24:26.664
I know.

00:24:28.098 --> 00:24:29.166
So I'm sorry.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.968
I'm really sorry.

00:24:31.835 --> 00:24:33.470
I must've lost my mind for a while.

00:24:34.505 --> 00:24:35.739
What are you trying to say?

00:24:37.074 --> 00:24:40.144
I'll break up with So Young.
So you break up with that jerk too,

00:24:41.912 --> 00:24:43.113
and marry me.

00:24:46.917 --> 00:24:50.087
Are you apologizing right now,
or proposing?

00:24:50.087 --> 00:24:51.855
Does it bother you that much
that I'm seeing someone?

00:24:52.189 --> 00:24:54.091
Enough that you want to stop it
with marriage?

00:24:54.091 --> 00:24:55.259
It's because I like you that much.

00:24:55.259 --> 00:24:57.194
I'm saying I'll even marry you.

00:24:57.194 --> 00:24:58.062
Don't you get it?

00:24:58.629 --> 00:24:59.630
So,

00:25:00.965 --> 00:25:02.166
let's start over.

00:25:03.167 --> 00:25:04.935
I'll really treat you right
this time, okay?

00:25:08.505 --> 00:25:09.907
Hey, why'd you hang up?

00:25:10.574 --> 00:25:13.444
Hearing that bastard beg like that
is so satisfying.

00:25:13.811 --> 00:25:15.679
I don't even need to hear it.

00:25:18.882 --> 00:25:21.185
No matter how hard I try to hide my charm,

00:25:21.185 --> 00:25:22.853
it just won't stay hidden.

00:25:22.853 --> 00:25:26.090
Why can't anyone get over me,
and they keep clinging like this?

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:27.958
Are you bragging right now?

00:25:31.462 --> 00:25:32.630
I'm jealous.

00:25:33.197 --> 00:25:34.798
Back when I was single,

00:25:34.798 --> 00:25:37.101
I had guys flocking to me left and right.

00:25:38.435 --> 00:25:39.270
Hey.

00:25:39.803 --> 00:25:42.539
Don't you think
I've been looking younger lately?

00:25:43.707 --> 00:25:44.742
Is it because of this?

00:25:44.742 --> 00:25:47.278
Hey! Go easy on that!

00:25:47.711 --> 00:25:48.979
You're so stingy.

00:25:58.789 --> 00:26:00.457
(Sweet Home Shopping)

00:26:05.496 --> 00:26:07.531
Did you hear about Seon Min?

00:26:08.265 --> 00:26:09.066
Ye Na.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.769
Do you really think it's right
to just stay quiet like this?

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:14.505
Keeping the truth buried any longer.

00:26:14.505 --> 00:26:16.607
Don't you think that's way too unfair
to Seon Min?

00:26:18.475 --> 00:26:20.444
But I only heard it secondhand,

00:26:20.444 --> 00:26:22.179
so it doesn't carry any weight
when I say it.

00:26:22.179 --> 00:26:23.047
That's why I really hope you...

00:26:23.047 --> 00:26:24.248
I told you before.

00:26:25.516 --> 00:26:26.517
I...

00:26:26.817 --> 00:26:28.686
never had anything like that happen to me.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.022
Why do you keep trying to drag me
into something so filthy?

00:26:32.022 --> 00:26:34.124
What on earth did you hear from her?

00:26:34.124 --> 00:26:36.126
I get that this puts you
in a tough spot, but...

00:26:36.126 --> 00:26:37.261
Who do you think you are, Producer?

00:26:38.395 --> 00:26:41.065
Were you seriously dating
Seon Min or something?

00:26:41.065 --> 00:26:44.101
Or do you just enjoy playing the hero?

00:26:44.935 --> 00:26:46.870
Why are you trying to meddle
in someone else's life?

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:47.871
Song Ye Na.

00:26:50.774 --> 00:26:53.911
Why do you think
Seon Min tried to kill herself?

00:26:56.347 --> 00:26:57.414
Maybe Seon Min...

00:26:58.115 --> 00:26:59.984
actually wanted to bury all of that...

00:27:00.884 --> 00:27:02.820
and go back to living like before.

00:27:03.354 --> 00:27:04.488
But then,

00:27:04.488 --> 00:27:06.056
you stuck your nose in for no reason,

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.159
and things blew up beyond repair.

00:27:09.526 --> 00:27:11.762
And when you couldn't take responsibility,
you backed out!

00:27:12.463 --> 00:27:14.298
How do you think
Seon Min felt at that moment?

00:27:16.166 --> 00:27:17.735
In the end, what pushed her that far...

00:27:18.235 --> 00:27:19.970
wasn't Kim Jeong Sik, but you.

00:27:20.404 --> 00:27:21.505
So...

00:27:22.373 --> 00:27:23.440
please,

00:27:24.742 --> 00:27:26.944
stop pretending to be some good guy
and just stay out of it.

00:27:40.724 --> 00:27:41.792
What happened to Seon Min?

00:27:41.792 --> 00:27:42.760
How is she?

00:27:44.128 --> 00:27:46.764
Her vital signs are back to normal,

00:27:47.498 --> 00:27:49.199
but she still won't wake up.

00:27:49.199 --> 00:27:50.601
The doctor says it's strange...

00:27:51.368 --> 00:27:53.437
and that it seems
like she's refusing to wake up.

00:27:54.805 --> 00:27:56.573
I should've asked to see her sooner.

00:27:56.573 --> 00:27:59.076
She ignored my calls a few times,

00:27:59.076 --> 00:28:00.077
so I just left her alone.

00:28:00.978 --> 00:28:03.113
It was awkward for us to reach out too.

00:28:03.113 --> 00:28:05.683
We all knew what happened,
but we couldn't really take sides.

00:28:05.683 --> 00:28:07.885
But we couldn't
exactly preach at her, either.

00:28:07.885 --> 00:28:08.786
But...

00:28:09.219 --> 00:28:12.056
what could've hurt so much
that she'd take pills?

00:28:12.456 --> 00:28:13.590
It's obvious.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.259
Producer Noh probably told her
they should break up.

00:28:15.592 --> 00:28:18.762
These days, Na Jeong
and Producer Noh look really close.

00:28:21.065 --> 00:28:24.201
Is it really right to keep hiding this
from Na Jeong?

00:28:24.535 --> 00:28:25.803
Forget it.

00:28:25.803 --> 00:28:27.771
Why should we step into
something this messy?

00:28:27.771 --> 00:28:30.007
What useless talk
are you two chattering about?

00:28:33.077 --> 00:28:34.345
Do you really have that little to do?

00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:37.247
You've got that much time...

00:28:37.247 --> 00:28:39.216
to gossip about baseless
and pointless rumors?

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:41.452
It's just...

00:28:41.452 --> 00:28:42.987
I don't care what it's about.

00:28:44.054 --> 00:28:46.090
Don't go around
spreading pointless rumors.

00:28:47.424 --> 00:28:50.527
Nothing like that
helps the company in any way.

00:28:51.295 --> 00:28:53.797
Do you want to stir up trouble
just by running your mouth?

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:01.472
Hello.

00:29:06.176 --> 00:29:07.344
You scared me.

00:29:07.344 --> 00:29:08.812
Why? What's going on?

00:29:09.213 --> 00:29:10.080
Hey.

00:29:10.514 --> 00:29:12.650
Do you know a woman named Seon Min?

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.151
Seon Min?

00:29:14.685 --> 00:29:16.387
Yeah, I've seen her.

00:29:16.687 --> 00:29:18.022
I heard she couldn't renew contract...

00:29:18.022 --> 00:29:20.791
and was having a hard time finding work.

00:29:21.091 --> 00:29:22.092
Hey, you idiot.

00:29:22.326 --> 00:29:24.528
This is not the time to be so calm.

00:29:24.528 --> 00:29:27.264
They say that woman
called Seon Min took pills.

00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:30.334
Why? Did something bad happen?

00:29:31.568 --> 00:29:33.270
Because of your husband.

00:29:33.637 --> 00:29:34.772
My husband?

00:29:35.806 --> 00:29:37.341
Tell me everything, in detail.

00:29:38.342 --> 00:29:39.677
Because of Producer Noh,

00:29:40.444 --> 00:29:42.246
Kim Seon Min took pills?

00:29:43.247 --> 00:29:45.582
No, Na Jeong, don't get the wrong idea.

00:29:45.582 --> 00:29:48.252
I was just speculating when I said that.

00:29:48.252 --> 00:29:49.486
Still,

00:29:49.486 --> 00:29:52.656
you must have had some reason
to think that, ma'am.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.195
I'm sorry, Na Jeong.

00:29:58.696 --> 00:30:00.464
Actually, for a while now,

00:30:00.464 --> 00:30:03.734
people have been saying
Producer Noh and Seon Min...

00:30:03.734 --> 00:30:05.069
were dating.

00:30:05.903 --> 00:30:07.671
I wanted to tell you,

00:30:07.671 --> 00:30:10.274
but since we didn't see it ourselves,
it felt wrong to say anything.

00:30:25.089 --> 00:30:26.957
Then why did that rumor start?

00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:29.893
There must've been something behind it.

00:30:30.527 --> 00:30:31.795
Well,

00:30:32.696 --> 00:30:35.866
some people saw Seon Min
grabbing onto Producer Noh...

00:30:35.866 --> 00:30:38.102
and crying in the conference room.

00:30:38.869 --> 00:30:41.438
And people saw them alone together
outside the office...

00:30:41.438 --> 00:30:43.140
multiple times.

00:30:43.474 --> 00:30:46.844
And a few colleagues said
that on their way out for drinks,

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:51.782
they saw Mr. Kim, the head of division,
alone with Producer Noh.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:57.187
And apparently,
Mr. Kim threw a drink in his face...

00:30:57.187 --> 00:30:59.223
and said this.

00:30:59.723 --> 00:31:02.393
Don't you feel even a little sorry
for Na Jeong waiting at home?

00:31:03.093 --> 00:31:05.129
Watch yourself and behave, you punk.

00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:32.389
Don't try to dodge this,
and answer me honestly.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.693
What exactly is going on
between you and this woman, Kim Seon Min?

00:31:37.861 --> 00:31:40.130
I don't know what you heard,

00:31:40.898 --> 00:31:43.167
but it's not what you think,
so don't get the wrong idea.

00:31:43.867 --> 00:31:45.336
Like I told you before,

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.404
she lost her job
and couldn't renew her contract,

00:31:47.404 --> 00:31:49.640
so I met her a few times
to connect her with people.

00:31:50.874 --> 00:31:52.309
I'll explain the details later.

00:31:52.743 --> 00:31:54.211
What are you playing at right now?

00:31:54.778 --> 00:31:58.315
I saw you with that woman myself,

00:31:58.315 --> 00:32:01.251
and everyone at work knows
you're having an affair with her.

00:32:02.152 --> 00:32:05.489
And yet you don't even think
you owe me an explanation?

00:32:06.557 --> 00:32:08.892
Do you seriously want to see me snap?

00:32:09.126 --> 00:32:11.195
I am not having an affair.

00:32:12.129 --> 00:32:14.298
There's something I can't tell you
that has to do with Seon Min.

00:32:14.932 --> 00:32:17.101
It's not something
I can just casually talk about.

00:32:17.434 --> 00:32:20.137
Once everything is settled,
I'll tell you everything. Okay?

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:21.839
Yeah.

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:23.607
This is exactly it.

00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:26.977
The part of you
that really drives me crazy.

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:31.348
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
that I believe you.

00:32:32.716 --> 00:32:34.084
But that's not the issue.

00:32:34.618 --> 00:32:36.854
All this time living with you,

00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:39.356
this is what's annoyed me the most.

00:32:40.397 --> 00:32:44.094
That dogmatism of deciding everything
on your own without ever talking to me.

00:32:44.094 --> 00:32:45.296
That patriarchal attitude.

00:32:46.997 --> 00:32:48.265
Do I look that pathetic to you?

00:32:48.666 --> 00:32:49.566
That easy to push around?

00:32:50.234 --> 00:32:53.604
If I'd known you were this stubborn
and impossible to talk to,

00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:56.640
I never would've married you.

00:32:57.608 --> 00:32:59.843
What, are you mad?

00:33:00.577 --> 00:33:03.547
You cheated with another woman,
got caught by everyone,

00:33:03.547 --> 00:33:05.416
and you can't even explain yourself.

00:33:05.749 --> 00:33:06.850
So what exactly are you mad about?

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.218
I told you it's not like that.

00:33:09.853 --> 00:33:12.856
Do you think I never say anything
because you don't have any flaws?

00:33:12.856 --> 00:33:14.058
You don't even look at the bigger picture.

00:33:14.058 --> 00:33:16.060
You jump to conclusions and go after
people like you're out to kill a rat.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.861
You treat me like a cheater
without a second thought.

00:33:20.364 --> 00:33:22.933
Every time this happens,
I get so sick and tired of it.

00:33:24.068 --> 00:33:26.770
Why do you always tear me down
and treat me like a criminal?

00:33:29.873 --> 00:33:30.774
You're...

00:33:32.242 --> 00:33:33.177
sick of me?

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:35.913
So what you're saying is,

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:39.149
you're fed up and worn out
from living with me, right?

00:33:42.853 --> 00:33:44.355
If you're that sick and tired,

00:33:45.255 --> 00:33:46.190
then let's end it.

00:33:47.825 --> 00:33:49.994
As if letting rumors spread
that you're cheating was not enough,

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:52.196
you're dumping the blame on me now.

00:33:52.429 --> 00:33:53.731
I don't want to live
with someone like that, either.

00:34:57.861 --> 00:34:59.163
Where are you?

00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:00.297
Did you actually walk out on the house?

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.174
(Won Bin)

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:11.075
Sorry.

00:35:11.508 --> 00:35:13.210
I'll be sleeping at the office
for a while.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:14.411
How can you be like this?

00:35:14.778 --> 00:35:16.480
So you really just don't care anymore?

00:35:17.147 --> 00:35:19.817
You're basically saying
you have no intention of fixing this.

00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:22.353
Fine, forget it.

00:35:22.786 --> 00:35:25.623
I don't want to live with someone
as irresponsible as you...

00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:27.024
anymore, either.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.907
(Filing for Mutual Divorce)

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:51.215
Please hand me your ID card.

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:58.389
The mutual-consent divorce application,

00:35:58.389 --> 00:36:00.557
your family relation certificate,
and marriage certificate.

00:36:00.557 --> 00:36:01.592
You brought them, right?

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:13.904
As you know, the hearing date
to confirm your intent to divorce...

00:36:13.904 --> 00:36:15.706
is set for four weeks from now.

00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:20.778
(Seoul Family Court)

00:36:31.722 --> 00:36:32.823
Go.

00:36:32.823 --> 00:36:33.991
See you on the hearing date.

00:36:35.592 --> 00:36:36.527
Wait.

00:36:40.164 --> 00:36:42.733
Can we at least grab a coffee
before we go?

00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:53.911
Say whatever you want to say.

00:37:02.252 --> 00:37:03.520
If you've got nothing to say, I'll go.

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:04.989
I'm sorry.

00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:10.794
For the way I spoke to you back then.

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:13.597
I've regretted it ever since.

00:37:18.435 --> 00:37:20.271
You wanted so badly to be a mom,

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.842
and I'm so sorry about that too.

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:30.948
It's fine.

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:34.118
Now that it's come to this,

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:36.854
what's the point of saying all that?

00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:40.190
When I think about it,

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:44.128
did I really want a baby?

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.465
Maybe because our relationship felt
so fragile and unstable,

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:51.902
I just clung to the idea even more.

00:37:55.272 --> 00:37:56.573
Maybe it's for the best.

00:37:58.409 --> 00:37:59.610
If we'd had a kid,

00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:02.479
divorce wouldn't be this easy.

00:38:07.851 --> 00:38:09.787
There's still one thing I want to know.

00:38:12.222 --> 00:38:13.691
When you married me,

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:17.594
was it really because you loved me?

00:38:22.666 --> 00:38:24.368
Then why did you need them?

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:36.614
I'm leaving.

00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:55.666
Gu Joo Young, your show was amazing.

00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:58.002
I was so moved I almost cried.

00:38:58.002 --> 00:39:00.771
Hey, you're supposed to swallow
your emotions, not your snot.

00:39:00.771 --> 00:39:01.839
With you sniffling like that,

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:04.208
I could barely focus.

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:06.310
- Won Bin.
- Yes?

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.778
What do you even like
about someone like her?

00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:09.446
Well,

00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:14.852
she's just pretty.

00:39:17.154 --> 00:39:18.188
I can't even.

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:20.157
Seriously?

00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:21.925
Cheers.

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:24.161
- Congrats, Gu Joo Young.
- Congrats!

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:25.062
Hey, Sang Min.

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:26.497
Long time no see.

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:28.732
Won Bin, long time no see.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.801
Who's that?

00:39:31.235 --> 00:39:32.903
A club friend from college.

00:39:34.738 --> 00:39:37.441
It looks like he came alone.
Invite him to join us.

00:39:37.441 --> 00:39:38.409
Yes, do that.

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:39.944
Ask him to drink with us.

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:41.612
Okay.

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:44.048
Hey, Sang Min.

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:46.116
If you came alone, come sit with us.

00:39:46.116 --> 00:39:47.751
No, I'm fine. Don't mind me.

00:39:47.751 --> 00:39:49.787
Hey, get over here and drink with us.

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:57.361
- This is my girlfriend.
- Hello.

00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:58.429
And these are her friends.

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:00.030
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.733
Sang Min works as an engineer at Naver.

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:04.969
Right? Naver?

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:05.836
Yeah.

00:40:06.236 --> 00:40:07.504
Great company you work for.

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:09.974
You must be a real talent in IT.

00:40:10.207 --> 00:40:11.108
Not really.

00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:12.910
- Would you like a drink?
- I don't drink.

00:40:15.245 --> 00:40:16.981
You don't need to feel awkward.

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.083
We're all just as awkward.

00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:39.169
Wait.

00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:43.574
Honey, aren't those so pretty?

00:40:44.308 --> 00:40:45.576
Yeah, they're pretty.

00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:49.413
Then can you buy them for my birthday?

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:52.182
Nope.

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:53.317
Why not?

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:56.687
They say if you buy someone shoes,
they'll run away.

00:40:59.456 --> 00:41:00.724
I don't want you to run away.

00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:02.293
What?

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.795
If you're not going anywhere,
I'll buy them.

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:55.112
Won Bin didn't come home
last night, either?

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:57.448
He didn't.

00:41:57.881 --> 00:42:00.718
That fool.

00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:04.154
Breaking his wife's heart like that.

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:09.627
Na Jeong.

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:12.630
Don't be too angry with him, okay?

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:17.601
When people hit their forties,

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:19.703
even the nicest ones...

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.206
start acting weird...

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.942
and can't get their head on straight.

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:27.444
It's part of growing up.

00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:31.181
Becoming a real adult isn't easy,
you know.

00:42:37.054 --> 00:42:38.122
Father.

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.123
Yeah?

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:41.558
You've lived with your wife
for 40 years, right?

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:43.861
Not only 40.

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:45.763
It's been 45.

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:50.901
You must've gone through everything.

00:42:52.436 --> 00:42:53.971
How did you make it work?

00:42:55.773 --> 00:42:57.441
Don't even get me started.

00:42:58.876 --> 00:42:59.843
But...

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:03.280
when you go through
all kinds of things together,

00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:05.883
you start to feel for each other.

00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:09.086
Once that tenderness kicks in,

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:12.456
that's the scariest part of all.

00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:48.792
(I Am the Best)

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:51.261
Guys.

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:53.430
You doing okay?

00:43:59.903 --> 00:44:01.005
Are you so blinded by success...

00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:03.274
you just threw your pride away?

00:44:03.274 --> 00:44:05.609
I told you not to grovel
to trash like her.

00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:28.832
Sang Gyu.

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:31.335
You look great in a suit.

00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:32.469
Right, Il Ri?

00:44:32.469 --> 00:44:33.270
Yeah.

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:35.406
Come on, let's go.

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:39.243
Okay.

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:55.526
Ms. Cho, you're here.

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:58.829
Congratulations, Hye Jeong.

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:00.230
You look gorgeous.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:01.765
Thank you, Na Jeong.

00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:03.767
When you're broke
and trying to get married,

00:45:03.767 --> 00:45:05.803
you've got no choice
but to lean on friends.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.540
I hope I didn't ask for help
when you were too busy.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.008
No, not at all.

00:45:11.008 --> 00:45:13.477
But where are the flowers, balloons,
and all the decorations?

00:45:13.477 --> 00:45:15.946
- Around that corner over there.
- Okay.

00:45:17.314 --> 00:45:18.983
By the way, where are Ms. Lee and Ms. Gu?

00:45:18.983 --> 00:45:20.117
They're not here yet.

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:21.852
Don't worry,
we'll finish it together when they come.

00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:25.723
You look beautiful.

00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:28.525
CEO Choi and Manager Eom.

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:30.227
How are you this early?

00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:31.662
It just happened.

00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:33.797
But what is all this?

00:45:33.797 --> 00:45:35.799
You said it'd be simple,
but it's beautiful.

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:38.035
I'm getting a little annoyed.

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:41.105
Thanks.

00:46:22.146 --> 00:46:23.247
Have you been waiting long?

00:46:25.316 --> 00:46:26.583
It turns out I'm in early menopause.

00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:30.054
What I thought were irregular periods...

00:46:30.054 --> 00:46:31.822
was actually early menopause.

00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:34.925
So I snapped at you for nothing.

00:46:34.925 --> 00:46:35.826
You'll just have to understand.

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:39.129
This feels a lot stranger than I expected.

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:41.599
Everyone else has it,
and I'm the only one who doesn't.

00:46:42.566 --> 00:46:43.734
It kind of feels like I got cut out.

00:46:47.605 --> 00:46:49.840
Don't cry yet.
I've got something to confess too.

00:46:50.808 --> 00:46:52.176
What is it?

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:54.178
I got divorced.

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:55.479
What?

00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:58.382
It's a long story,

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:00.684
but in short, he was a pervert.

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:03.320
A creepy pervert who talks to mannequins.

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:09.994
Why are you doing this?
You're embarrassing us.

00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:10.694
Shush.

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:12.896
Stop.

00:47:12.896 --> 00:47:14.932
Sorry.

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:16.867
I'm the terrible one.

00:47:17.868 --> 00:47:19.703
Keep your voice down.

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:24.975
What's wrong with you?

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:39.456
What do you think you're doing right now?

00:47:39.456 --> 00:47:40.391
Just be honest.

00:47:41.392 --> 00:47:42.893
You're not really her boyfriend, are you?

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:46.196
Why do you keep picking fights with me?

00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:49.266
Il Ri really hates anything tacky.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.168
And you...

00:47:52.036 --> 00:47:54.538
You're just so wrong.

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:56.073
Excuse me.

00:47:57.107 --> 00:47:59.410
If you still have feelings for your ex,

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.246
shouldn't you apologize properly
and ask her how she feels?

00:48:03.147 --> 00:48:05.249
Why scheme behind her back like a coward?

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:06.583
Aren't you ashamed?

00:48:09.053 --> 00:48:10.988
Who are you to butt in and lecture me?

00:48:11.689 --> 00:48:12.923
Who do you think you are?

00:48:15.025 --> 00:48:16.427
What am I supposed to do with this punk?

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:19.997
You didn't want responsibility before,

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:21.632
but now that someone else might take her,
you can't stand it?

00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:24.702
Does Il Ri know how pathetic you are?

00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:26.136
Pathetic?

00:48:27.204 --> 00:48:28.339
I can't even.

00:48:30.174 --> 00:48:31.108
Come outside.

00:48:35.813 --> 00:48:37.014
She took pills?

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:39.683
Unbelievable.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.820
So the two went and played
Romeo and Juliet?

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:45.222
Like this is some epic tragic love story,

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:47.424
she took pills
and ended up in the hospital,

00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:49.860
and after all that,

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.595
he just walked out with no explanation?

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:53.330
Just divorce him already.

00:48:53.831 --> 00:48:55.599
Still, we don't know the whole story.

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:57.434
Jumping straight to divorce feels harsh.

00:48:57.835 --> 00:49:00.671
Did you do some huge investigation
before you divorced?

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.273
My situation was different.

00:49:02.273 --> 00:49:04.975
I caught them myself with my own two eyes.

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:07.511
Na Jeong said
she saw the two of them together too.

00:49:08.112 --> 00:49:10.147
Come to think of it, when you said
you were joining the company,

00:49:10.147 --> 00:49:11.482
he tried so hard to stop you.

00:49:12.383 --> 00:49:14.385
I guess he was scared
he'd get caught having an affair.

00:49:16.954 --> 00:49:19.023
How far are you going?
We can talk right here.

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:22.259
Why are we having this conversation
at a wedding hall?

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.094
What was that about "pathetic" before?

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:26.130
Say it again.

00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:27.331
Hey.

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:29.433
Your guys are fighting.

00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:33.437
They've lost it.
What's wrong with them?

00:49:34.138 --> 00:49:35.639
Hey, what is happening?

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:37.341
Since when is Sang Gyu Il Ri's man?

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:40.077
He confessed his feelings to her
not long ago.

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:41.812
What? Then what's with Eom Jong Do?

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.681
He asked Il Ri to marry him.

00:49:43.681 --> 00:49:46.250
Lee Il Ri, why are you so popular?

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:48.752
This stupid popularity
is driving me insane.

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:50.020
Hey.

00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:58.462
Stop it already!

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:03.634
Il Ri, be honest.

00:50:04.368 --> 00:50:06.270
You're not actually dating
this guy, right?

00:50:07.071 --> 00:50:09.273
You're just pretending
so I'll get jealous, right?

00:50:10.574 --> 00:50:11.675
Il Ri, you're my girl.

00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:13.377
You can't get over me, so why...

00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:14.244
No!

00:50:14.545 --> 00:50:16.580
I like him, not you.

00:50:17.615 --> 00:50:18.616
We already slept together.

00:50:21.318 --> 00:50:22.152
Liar.

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:24.622
You're lying, right?

00:50:24.622 --> 00:50:25.589
I'm not lying.

00:50:26.357 --> 00:50:28.592
I don't have any feelings left for you.

00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:29.426
Il Ri.

00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:32.529
Until recently, you wanted to marry me.

00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:34.031
Yeah, I did.

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:36.233
I pretended I didn't, but I did.

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.003
But the moment you asked me to marry you,

00:50:39.003 --> 00:50:40.037
everything became clear.

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:42.473
The person I want to marry...

00:50:42.473 --> 00:50:44.174
isn't you. It's him.

00:50:47.311 --> 00:50:48.579
They're getting married?

00:50:48.579 --> 00:50:50.114
Even if I hadn't screwed up,

00:50:51.582 --> 00:50:52.716
woul you still have dated him?

00:50:53.517 --> 00:50:54.485
Yeah.

00:50:55.586 --> 00:50:56.654
I think I would have.

00:50:58.088 --> 00:51:00.991
Then I would've been the one cheating,
not you.

00:51:05.229 --> 00:51:06.263
Do you get it now?

00:51:06.997 --> 00:51:09.867
You and I are really over.

00:51:10.935 --> 00:51:13.370
So let go and live your life.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.285
What now? What's going on?

00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:39.396
Hey, why are you dumping your confession
on someone else?

00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:40.297
Wait!

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:41.398
Don't come any closer.

00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:48.138
The truth is, I...

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:50.608
actually...

00:51:55.346 --> 00:51:56.180
I can't have...

00:52:00.284 --> 00:52:02.386
Can we take things a little slower?

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.689
I'm sorry,
but I'm still not sure about you.

00:52:06.824 --> 00:52:07.825
Well,

00:52:08.626 --> 00:52:10.127
no matter how old we are,

00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:12.162
we should move forward step by step...

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:15.332
while we're seeing
if we're really right for each other.

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:18.535
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?

00:52:20.771 --> 00:52:22.506
That's how I see it.

00:52:23.374 --> 00:52:24.708
You're right.

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:27.745
But we already, you know...

00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:32.816
Yeah, you're right.

00:52:37.955 --> 00:52:40.224
I can't even.

00:52:41.125 --> 00:52:43.060
They say the quiet cat
is the first to jump on the stove...

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:46.230
Hey, say it right. She's not a quiet cat.

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:48.832
True.

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:50.668
She's a wild, delinquent cat.

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:55.005
But did you also not know
that they slept together?

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:55.873
I had no idea.

00:52:57.708 --> 00:53:00.110
The more I think about it,
the more upsetting this is.

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:01.712
We tell her everything,

00:53:01.712 --> 00:53:03.013
but she keeps things from us.

00:53:04.214 --> 00:53:05.549
Because it was Sang Gyu.

00:53:06.617 --> 00:53:09.153
To us, Sang Gyu is pretty much family.

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:13.290
Yeah.

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:16.460
There are things you can't say
because they're family.

00:53:23.601 --> 00:53:25.536
Hey, then...

00:53:26.804 --> 00:53:28.872
about your husband and my husband.

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.576
Maybe there's something
they couldn't tell us...

00:53:32.576 --> 00:53:35.279
for that same reason.
Because we're family.

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:38.682
You're right.

00:53:40.084 --> 00:53:41.919
A line from a drama
just popped into my head.

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:43.654
What?

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:46.390
"Even if everyone else knew,

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:48.225
I just hoped my family wouldn't."

00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:07.845
Hello, Mr. Kim.
This is Cho Na Jeong.

00:54:07.845 --> 00:54:11.048
If you have a moment,
could I see you for a bit?

00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:20.924
I'm sorry to bother you
when you're off the clock.

00:54:23.794 --> 00:54:25.162
I'm the head of division.

00:54:25.696 --> 00:54:27.431
I should've been the one to ask you first.
Sorry about that.

00:54:28.165 --> 00:54:30.401
How's your internship going?

00:54:31.936 --> 00:54:33.037
Anything giving you trouble?

00:54:33.971 --> 00:54:35.172
It's not that.

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.609
There's just one thing I wanted to ask.

00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:39.610
What is it?

00:54:40.978 --> 00:54:42.513
I heard that Producer Noh Won Bin...

00:54:43.681 --> 00:54:46.016
and former show host Kim Seon Min,
who left,

00:54:46.383 --> 00:54:49.219
were in an inappropriate relationship.

00:54:51.355 --> 00:54:52.423
Is that true?

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:54.625
Why ask me that?

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:56.927
I heard that because of it,

00:54:56.927 --> 00:54:59.496
you called Producer Noh in
and gave him a scolding.

00:55:01.165 --> 00:55:02.266
That.

00:55:04.735 --> 00:55:08.005
When that ridiculous rumor
started going around the company,

00:55:08.739 --> 00:55:11.041
I called him in and told him
to watch his behavior.

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:12.042
I just gave him a talking-to, that's all.

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:14.511
I don't really know the details, either.

00:55:20.351 --> 00:55:22.653
When I heard those rumors,

00:55:23.854 --> 00:55:25.522
you were the first person
who came to mind.

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:27.324
You know I was really fond of you.

00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:29.960
I thought about how crushed you must be.

00:55:30.594 --> 00:55:33.464
So I scolded him...

00:55:33.464 --> 00:55:35.165
like an older brother would.

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:38.068
So you only heard it as a rumor too, then?

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.037
Yeah.

00:55:40.504 --> 00:55:43.207
Did you call in show host Kim Seon Min
and ask her as well?

00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:47.111
Well,

00:55:47.111 --> 00:55:50.381
by then, Seon Min had already resigned.

00:55:50.381 --> 00:55:52.116
And usually, in situations like that,

00:55:52.583 --> 00:55:55.753
people assume the married man
is more at fault, not the single woman.

00:56:22.313 --> 00:56:23.981
Seon Young, it's me.

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:27.851
Do you happen to know
which hospital Kim Seon Min is in?

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:41.599
(Wishing you a speedy recovery,
Kim * Min)

00:56:53.177 --> 00:56:54.011
I'm sorry.

00:56:55.012 --> 00:56:55.946
Seon Min.

00:56:59.049 --> 00:57:00.751
I know you wouldn't want me here,

00:57:01.952 --> 00:57:02.987
but I came anyway.

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:05.990
If I don't see you,

00:57:07.358 --> 00:57:09.360
I don't think I'll be able to sleep.

00:57:11.695 --> 00:57:13.130
You resented me a lot, didn't you?

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.434
I'm sorry.

00:57:17.935 --> 00:57:19.703
But I was so scared.

00:57:20.471 --> 00:57:22.539
I was scared I'd be blacklisted
in the industry.

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:29.546
Still, why did you have to take pills?

00:57:30.648 --> 00:57:33.417
How am I supposed to live
with this guilt now?

00:57:37.988 --> 00:57:39.290
Ye Na, what do you mean by that?

00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:40.924
Na Jeong.

00:57:41.492 --> 00:57:43.193
Why are you here?

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:46.163
What did you mean by what you just said?

00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:48.565
It's nothing.

00:57:50.501 --> 00:57:51.869
Don't lie to me.

00:57:51.869 --> 00:57:53.504
You clearly know what's going on.

00:57:53.737 --> 00:57:56.674
Explain to me
why Seon Min took those pills.

00:58:00.544 --> 00:58:01.512
Ye Na.

00:58:02.179 --> 00:58:03.180
Ye Na.

00:58:17.227 --> 00:58:20.731
I report sexual harassment
by K, the Head of Division,

00:58:21.265 --> 00:58:22.366
at Sweet Home Shopping.

00:58:24.768 --> 00:58:25.502
(Yang Mi Sook)

00:58:27.404 --> 00:58:28.372
Mi Sook.

00:58:28.372 --> 00:58:30.541
Hey, did you see the screenshot
I sent you?

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.476
What is this?

00:58:32.476 --> 00:58:35.579
I had a feeling
Kim Seon Min and your husband...

00:58:35.579 --> 00:58:38.882
had something shady going on,
so I sounded out Assistant Manager Ha.

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:39.783
Assistant Manager Ha?

00:58:40.117 --> 00:58:41.518
Who's that?

00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:42.620
Didn't I tell you?

00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.421
Someone on the company's legal team
who's been tagging along with me lately.

00:58:45.489 --> 00:58:46.323
And?

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:50.461
But the guy kept insisting
he didn't know a thing...

00:58:50.461 --> 00:58:52.062
and wouldn't talk no matter what.

00:58:52.396 --> 00:58:54.932
So while he stepped into the bathroom
for a minute,

00:58:55.232 --> 00:58:57.067
I secretly went through his phone,

00:58:57.067 --> 00:58:58.335
and that's what I found.

00:58:59.103 --> 00:59:00.304
So from that,

00:59:00.904 --> 00:59:03.073
it looks like it wasn't your husband
she had an affair with,

00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:04.942
but that rat-faced division head...

00:59:04.942 --> 00:59:07.111
she got tangled up with.

00:59:09.013 --> 00:59:10.214
The way I see it,

00:59:10.614 --> 00:59:13.584
your husband was just trying
to help his junior...

00:59:13.584 --> 00:59:14.918
and ended up cornered.

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:18.122
Since it involved the higher-ups,

00:59:18.122 --> 00:59:20.024
if he said something reckless,

00:59:20.024 --> 00:59:21.692
he probably thought
he'd get his head chopped off.

00:59:22.626 --> 00:59:25.462
That's probably why
he couldn't explain himself to anyone.

00:59:26.797 --> 00:59:29.967
Don't I sound like a detective?

00:59:41.912 --> 00:59:43.514
And usually, in situations like that,

00:59:44.014 --> 00:59:47.184
people assume the married man
is more at fault, not the single woman.

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:13.978
It was really tough.

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:16.780
Seriously.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.383
Well, look at our lovely show hosts.

01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:21.785
What's got you all smiles?

01:00:23.387 --> 01:00:27.324
We were just swapping
some scary stories from work.

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:28.859
I'd love to hear those too.

01:00:29.627 --> 01:00:31.662
I'll set up a team dinner soon, okay?

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.632
- Good work, then.
- Yes.

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:42.940
But the way he looks at us...

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.808
is kind of unsettling.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:46.343
Is it just me who thinks that?

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:48.479
You too?
Honestly, me too.

01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:54.018
He's just a nice, playful guy.

01:00:54.018 --> 01:00:56.387
If you nitpick all that,
how are you going to survive at work?

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.589
Come on, let's drink and head back in.

01:01:12.036 --> 01:01:12.970
What are you doing here?

01:01:17.975 --> 01:01:19.643
You reek of alcohol.

01:01:19.643 --> 01:01:21.211
Why did you drink so much?

01:01:23.714 --> 01:01:26.951
That habit you have of deciding everything
on your own without talking to me.

01:01:26.951 --> 01:01:28.385
That patriarchal attitude.

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:29.687
Do I look that pathetic to you?

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:30.988
That easy to push around?

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:35.125
If I'd known you were this stubborn
and impossible to talk to,

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:38.162
I never would've married you.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:15.833
(Min Woo, Min Jun's Mom)

01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:27.478
Honey, I'm sorry.

01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:33.384
You're still...

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:36.020
the man I'd most want to be married to.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:01.912
About everything,

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:04.848
I'm sorry I couldn't explain it properly.

01:03:07.418 --> 01:03:08.485
Seon Min...

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:12.056
came to me saying
there was no one else she could trust.

01:03:13.891 --> 01:03:15.893
You and the kids kept coming to mind,

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.196
but I just couldn't bring myself
to turn her away.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:22.032
And in the end,
I ended up flagged at work.

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:27.004
In the middle of all that,
you said you were joining the company.

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:30.374
And I really didn't want...

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:33.143
you to see just how pathetic I'd been.

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:38.949
Me too.

01:03:39.717 --> 01:03:41.952
I'm sorry for doubting you first
without knowing the full story.

01:03:44.555 --> 01:03:47.491
I should've trusted my own husband.

01:03:49.093 --> 01:03:50.728
But once I learned what really happened,

01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:54.898
it brought something back to me.

01:03:57.735 --> 01:03:58.769
You've always been...

01:04:00.037 --> 01:04:01.472
the kind of person...

01:04:01.472 --> 01:04:03.474
who can't just walk past
someone powerless.

01:04:05.376 --> 01:04:07.344
For someone like you to go through this,

01:04:08.112 --> 01:04:09.947
it must have eaten you up inside.

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.684
It must have been hard carrying it alone.

01:04:15.119 --> 01:04:16.654
You had to protect your family,

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:20.691
and still protect your conscience
in a mess like that.

01:04:23.127 --> 01:04:24.895
You must have been really torn up inside.

01:04:29.133 --> 01:04:30.134
But honey,

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:34.805
what happened to Seon Min...

01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:37.341
is not on you.

01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:40.377
Don't beat yourself up.

01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:46.617
Thank you.

01:04:47.518 --> 01:04:48.352
Na Jeong.

01:04:55.259 --> 01:04:57.061
Hello,
I'm show host Kim Gwan Woo.

01:04:57.061 --> 01:04:59.029
Joining you today,
I'm show host Yoon Chae Ryeong.

01:04:59.029 --> 01:05:02.666
Everyone, did you brush your teeth
after your late-night snack yesterday?

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:06.537
We brush our teeth
three times a day out of habit, right?

01:05:06.537 --> 01:05:07.771
- But did you know this?
- Know what?

01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:10.708
If you brush halfheartedly,
all the plaque that's built up all day...

01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:12.743
just stays right there.

01:05:12.743 --> 01:05:14.111
But with our Denden Brush...

01:05:14.111 --> 01:05:15.179
But that night,

01:05:15.879 --> 01:05:18.282
I could barely sleep.

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:27.191
I understood
my husband's feelings all too well,

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.928
but if we brought the truth to light,

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:34.632
we'd both have to be ready
to lose our jobs.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.901
And for our family,

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:40.604
that was just too big a risk to take.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:48.445
Honey, why aren't you sleeping?

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:53.150
Just.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.921
What's wrong? You can't sleep?

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:01.392
Honey, listen.

01:06:02.126 --> 01:06:04.862
I have a favor to ask.

01:06:11.936 --> 01:06:13.003
Why don't we...

01:06:14.738 --> 01:06:15.839
just...

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:17.975
pretend we don't know anything
about Seon Min?

01:06:23.047 --> 01:06:24.748
I know exactly
how much this is eating you up.

01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:26.050
I really do.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:27.685
But...

01:06:28.218 --> 01:06:30.587
you know what it meant to me
to join this company.

01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:33.223
You know that too.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:35.826
And more than anything,

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:39.096
we're Min Woo and Min Jun's parents.

01:06:40.998 --> 01:06:43.033
As much as it hurts
to see someone treated unfairly,

01:06:43.801 --> 01:06:47.137
keeping our family safe
matters more to me.

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:49.340
So...

01:06:51.542 --> 01:06:52.910
for our family,

01:06:56.013 --> 01:06:57.147
can we just...

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:00.517
step away from this?

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:09.787
(Don't call me ma'am)

01:08:10.154 --> 01:08:11.755
What's the rumor going around right now?

01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:13.958
You...

01:08:13.958 --> 01:08:17.227
pushed Won Bin to report
the head of division...

01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:18.929
to the ethics committee, didn't you?

01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:21.599
Let me be blunt.

01:08:21.932 --> 01:08:24.501
If you didn't have
that creepy little hobby of yours,

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.270
do you really think
things would've gone this far?

01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:27.871
Who are you calling a pervert right now?

01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:30.207
- Mom, stop.
- You should speak up if you're wronged.

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:31.542
When you get married,

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:33.577
do you want to have kids?

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:35.012
Wait.

01:08:35.613 --> 01:08:38.415
Let's stay friends as working moms...

01:08:38.982 --> 01:08:40.216
for a long, long time.

01:08:40.217 --> 01:08:41.552
Why are you trying
to slap this kind of label on me?

01:08:41.552 --> 01:08:43.454
What grudge do you have against me?

01:08:43.854 --> 01:08:47.124
Did you order this, Executive Director?

01:08:49.994 --> 01:08:51.996
