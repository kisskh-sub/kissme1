00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.719
Son,

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.719
Do you think His Majesty will really
pay extra for it?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.560
Of course.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.759
Ping'an,

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.679
Let's compete.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.319
Come on.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.480
That's pretty accurate.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.799
My turn.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.840
Son, stop playing.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.519
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.040
Dad, move aside quickly.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.959
Watch out for misfire.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.599
Th-this...

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:38.000
Y-Young Duke...

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.000
Th-this...

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.359
That's incredible.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:50.120
Ping'an,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.480
Carrying that big bow all day
isn't convenient.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.719
I'll give you a new weapon.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.920
If you ever get surrounded,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.319
while I'm loading gunpowder,

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:05.799
use this.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.040
Catch them off guard.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.319
Young Duke, how do I use this?

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.759
That's really impressive.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.400
Young Duke, Young Duke!

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:31.800
The court has sent something.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:35.680
Let's go, Dad.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.759
Let's check it out.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.800
This is from the court.

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.080
Maybe it's the silk payment
from His Majesty.

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:56.560
At court today,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.719
Ministers Li Wei and Liu Han advised

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.120
the court is short on cash.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.439
So they're using paper shares.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.240
Duke,

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.599
Each share must be exchanged
at the Imperial Estate.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.759
There's a handling fee for each.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.080
For these 510,000 shares,

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.240
just the fees alone

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.159
cost over 15,000 strings of cash.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.520
It's all small change.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.520
Let's just take these shares.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.960
I figured

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.680
His Majesty wouldn't pay so easily.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.280
Forget it.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.439
My real goal

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.000
wasn't to make money off him.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.919
But being tricked like this

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.560
really annoys me.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.000
Feifan, what do you want to do?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.439
He's the emperor.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.039
What can I do to him?

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.280
I can only use these shares

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.159
to redeem our furniture.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.360
Then go feast at the priciest
restaurant in the capital.

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:42.800
Wouldn't that be carefree?

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.240
Greedy.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.759
Go ahead.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.560
Please, have mercy, give me
some food.

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:53.159
Get lost.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.719
This is a place for nobles.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.039
You don't belong here.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:57.120
Please...

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.520
Give me food, go, get out!

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.520
Please, give me food.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.199
Stop!

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.080
Young Duke!

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.800
What brings you here today?

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.199
Please, upstairs.

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.080
Give him some food, put it
on my tab.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680
Thank you, sir.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.919
Thank you for saving me, sir.
Get up.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.520
Thank you, thank you, sir.

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:15.599
Hurry up.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.839
Thank you for saving me, sir.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.480
Thank you, thank you, sir.

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.000
What are you staring at?
Give it to him.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:24.199
Here, take it.

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:27.319
This is yours too.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.240
My sister hasn't eaten yet.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Can I trade this for more?

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.439
The Duke ordered me to
guard the princess.

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.720
She's not at the Shi residence.

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:51.920
Where could she be?

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.120
Young Duke, you're here.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.680
I'll personally take your order.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.920
What would you like?

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.519
I want Peking duck, fish head
with chili,

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:04.680
chicken with mushrooms,
Governor's tofu,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.600
lamb stew, Xinjiang big plate chicken.

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.480
Young Duke, we don't have those.

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.160
You don't even have basic dishes here.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.399
How do you stay in business?

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.800
Young Duke, you've misunderstood.

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:18.040
Although our Fan Lou

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.480
hosts so many high officials
and nobles,

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:20.959
we don't actually make money.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.720
We lose money year after year.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.319
High officials and nobles come here,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.160
which means information converges.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.360
Year after year of losses.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.839
How much silver to buy Fan Lou?

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.680
Miss,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.600
Move aside, move aside!

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.160
This is great, Southern Dynasty
lowborns!

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.560
Buy one, miss! Open your dog eyes!

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:46.720
We're envoys from Qiang Country!

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.800
Hurry up and move aside!

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.199
Step back!

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.480
I'll take this one.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.160
Move aside!

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:56.920
Thank you.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.720
Quick, go!

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.639
Move away quickly!

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:08.920
Look, look at the rouge.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.800
Smells nice.

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.800
The scent of Southern Dynasty
women in bed.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.879
Take them all.

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:18.800
Yes.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.160
Sir, you can't leave yet.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.720
You haven't paid.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.480
Get lost!

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.959
You haven't paid yet!

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:23.319
It's an honor our envoy
even wants your stuff.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.199
And you still want money?

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.319
You still want money?

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:27.680
Beat him!

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.800
What are you looking at?
Move!

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:30.040
That's what you get for
asking for money.

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.439
Imperial Jade Wine,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.120
one hundred eighty per cup.

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.399
Will you dare next time?

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.399
Do you still want this job?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.800
You don't pay and still
think you're right?

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:49.439
Let's go, take a look.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.439
You want money? I said you want money!

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:06.360
Everyone, get out of my way!

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:07.160
Stop right there!

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.000
You're really quite pretty.

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:18.040
You've got spirit. I like that.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.079
I'll have time to teach you a lesson.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.800
In broad daylight,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.360
you snatch a woman off the street.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.720
Do you think nothing of us Southern Dynasty folk?

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:31.160
A worthless drunk

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.879
dares to meddle in our business?

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.879
You must be tired of living.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.480
The Qiang envoy hit someone! I didn't hit him!

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.199
I saw it.

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.240
They started it first.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.199
The Qiang envoy is attacking people!

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.199
He's hitting people!

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:48.360
I didn't hit him!

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:50.160
He started it first.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.240
Stop shouting! I didn't hit him.

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:52.399
Get up.

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:54.600
Darn it!

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:56.600
Nice hit!

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.800
Bullying us Southern Dynasty folk—

00:07:58.079 --> 00:07:59.319
Ask me if I allow it first!

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.240
Hit him!

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:02.120
Hit him! Hit him!

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.519
Hit him!

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.040
Hit him!

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:06.360
Hit!

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:06.920
Hurry, go!

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:08.160
Go, quickly!

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.199
Don't let him get away!

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:09.639
Hit him!

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:10.399
Don't let him escape!

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:10.959
Go, hurry!

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:11.839
You sure run fast.

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:12.439
That's right.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.279
Just you wait!

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:14.199
Don't let me see you again.

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:17.279
Don't let me see you again.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:17.759
Exactly.

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:24.800
Thank you, sir.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.680
I can't repay your kindness.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.560
Shuang'er has no one to rely on.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.199
I'm willing to serve as a maid.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.440
To repay your life-saving grace.

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:35.200
Young Duke.

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:37.639
Miss Shuang'er is so pitiful.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.440
She's quite pretty, too.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.679
If Young Duke doesn't take her in,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.679
the Qiang envoy surely won't spare her.

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:53.480
It's just one more mouth to feed.

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:54.360
Let's go.

00:09:07.559 --> 00:09:08.120
Miss.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.879
Courtesan.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.519
I'm a rough man.

00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:13.279
I suggest you take off your clothes.

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:14.799
Dance for me in public.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.240
Honored guest,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.000
Get lost!

00:09:20.919 --> 00:09:22.720
Refuse a toast, get forced to drink.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.080
Strip her for me!

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:28.720
Sir.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.279
Three-pointer!

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.960
You ruined my plans again!

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:38.879
Plans?

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.759
You Qiang people only do wicked things.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:42.960
Ping'an.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.559
You—

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:55.120
Sir.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:57.879
Go, go!

00:09:58.759 --> 00:09:59.240
Move aside!

00:09:59.440 --> 00:09:59.919
Move!

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.919
You've ruined my plans twice.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.159
Then let the Southern Dynasty princess

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:06.279
become a Qiang man's concubine!

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.399
Get out!

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.240
Hurry up and get out!

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.840
Thank you, Young Duke.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.879
It was nothing.

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:17.720
Buy me a drink sometime.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.159
That'll be your thanks.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.080
Filthy man.

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:25.120
Young Duke, please.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.159
Wicked woman.

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:29.039
Just wait for trouble to come.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.320
Qiang Country is making outrageous demands.

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:37.759
They want more tribute.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.039
What do you all think?

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:45.320
Your Majesty.

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:48.159
For our great Southern Dynasty to pay tribute to that barbaric country

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:49.600
is already a blow to our dignity.

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:51.200
If we agree this time,

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.840
we'll become a laughingstock.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.120
I believe

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:57.399
now is the time to show our nation's strength.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.720
I am willing to lead troops against Qiang Country.

00:11:01.799 --> 00:11:04.159
Your Majesty, war affects the people.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.559
We should negotiate first.

00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:08.600
To avoid harming the innocent.

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:10.720
The Duke hasn't fought in ages.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.600
Why can't you even stand up straight?

00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:15.480
Your Majesty, I think

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:17.399
the Duke of Nan is right.

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:19.759
Our great nation should win with reason.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:20.960
Sending troops now

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.080
would put the people in danger.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.399
It's bad for the State.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.120
Foreigners are greedy and ambitious.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.519
Today they want tribute.

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:30.519
Tomorrow they'll want our land and cities.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.480
Should we agree to that too?

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.440
Report!

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:35.919
Your Majesty.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.720
The Young Duke of Nan attacked

00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:39.279
the Qiang envoy in the street.

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:41.600
Qiang Country demands more tribute

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:42.679
and a marriage alliance with the princess.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:43.960
What?

00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:57.960
I—

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:00.360
I'm not drunk.

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:03.960
If Qiang Country doesn't fall,

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:05.879
I won't fall.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.000
Won't fall.

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:16.000
Shuang'er.

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:17.759
I'm leaving everything here to you.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.960
I'll return to the palace first.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.519
Do as the princess commands.

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:25.480
Who's the princess?

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:28.000
You are.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:30.799
You are.

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:32.679
I'm not.

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:36.759
I am the princess.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:04.799
Imperial Brother.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.960
Imperial Brother.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.720
It was clearly the Qiang envoy

00:13:15.799 --> 00:13:17.200
who attacked our people.

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:19.000
Why must we give them more tribute?

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:20.799
And let Zhi'er marry for alliance?

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:21.759
Why?

00:13:24.159 --> 00:13:25.799
Isn't it all because of that brat from the Shi family?

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:26.840
His so-called good deeds.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.960
But Shi Feifan did nothing wrong.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.519
Your Majesty.

00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:34.440
Feifan hit the Qiang envoy.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.480
On the surface, he seems at fault.

00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:38.360
But, Your Majesty, think about it.

00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:41.480
He was actually showing our dynasty's might.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.840
Now our dynasty is prosperous and strong.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.679
As for the matter of tribute,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.120
first, Qiang Country shouldn't raise it at will.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.279
Second,

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.759
whether to continue it

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.679
is still up for discussion.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.639
The Empress makes a good point.

00:13:58.519 --> 00:13:59.639
But this Qiang envoy

00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:01.240
is a complete scoundrel.

00:14:01.559 --> 00:14:02.799
If we send a civil official,

00:14:03.159 --> 00:14:04.480
the outcome is predictable.

00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:05.879
If we send a military official,

00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:08.120
it might backfire.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.360
If this isn't handled well,

00:14:11.799 --> 00:14:13.679
it'll be hard to silence public opinion.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.519
Everything has its counter in this world.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.480
A rascal for a scoundrel—

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.960
might just work.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.360
A rascal...

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:26.159
That brat from the Shi family.

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:31.360
But...

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.879
Imperial Brother,

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:35.759
Zhi'er worries about her marriage,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.320
but she's even more concerned for the state.

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:39.559
Think about it, after all these years,

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:40.720
only Shi Feifan

00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:42.279
made the Qiang envoy suffer.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.559
So be it.

00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:47.120
Attendant!

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.879
Summon Shi Feifan.
