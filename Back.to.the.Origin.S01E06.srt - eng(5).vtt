It's over here.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.600
Okay.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.720
What are you doing with that hanger?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.800
Take it easy.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.680
[You're too far back.]

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.680
[You should lean back.]

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.560
[A little more.]

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.000
What's this hanger for?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.160
[Why do you take that?]

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.280
[You'd lose face]

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.240
[in front of your parents]

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.360
[for my wrinkled suit.]

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.440
[Then where are]

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.120
[you putting it?]

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.520
[Economy class]

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.720
[passengers aren't allowed to hang it.]

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.240
Excuse me?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.880
Excuse me?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.520
Thank you.

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:28.600
See?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.640
I didn't give her.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.520
She took it from me.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.320
[I'd say those fourteen hours]

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.840
[on the plane were]

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.520
[the most agonizing time of my life.]

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.400
[Unbelievable.]

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.400
[What an]

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.040
[startling coincidence:]

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.640
[my cousin and I]

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.080
[took the same flight back.]

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.880
[I wish I'd had this luck during all the time]

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.480
[I spent waiting]

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.440
[for my immigration visa.]

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.400
[How ironic!]

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.680
[Just as the saying goes:]

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.080
[when it rains,]

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.560
[it pours.]

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.840
[It's quite ridiculous.]

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.320
[Although we've both been in Toronto]

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.760
[over the past eight years,]

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.640
[we've only exchanged]

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.760
[holiday greetings]

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.640
[through text messages.]

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.760
[Fortunately,]

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.800
[she probably didn't notice me.]

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.560
[After all the sufferings,]

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.960
[I finally found a budget]

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.160
[hotel room with]

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.680
[a similar arrangement]

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.240
[to my home in Canada.]

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.480
[My entire suitcase was stuffed]

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.520
[with my old curtains]

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.280
[and knickknacks.]

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.920
[How pathetic.]

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.600
[It seems like all I have left]

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.680
[from my eight years]

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.160
[in Canada are these things.]

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.079
[I'm such a failure.]

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.280
[Anyway, I need to]

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.960
[fool my mom first.]

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.200
Miss me?

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.800
Yes.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.240
Why are you wearing so little?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.000
[I thought Canada]

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.240
[has been pretty cold lately.]

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.839
It's pretty warm

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.760
indoors today.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.240
[Mom.]

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.200
[I'll be busy with work]

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.440
[for a while.]

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.200
We might not

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.320
be able to video chat for a while.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.560
Okay, I know.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.040
You've just renewed your work visa.

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.920
You should focus on your job.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.520
Well,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.640
your cousin and her husband are back.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.480
[Yesterday, the entire family]

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.200
[went to your aunt's place for a gathering.]

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.880
Did you watch

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.760
the video I sent you?

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.800
What video?

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.000
The video about

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.480
your cousin being an overseas personal shopper.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.240
She looked a mess.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.640
She said she wants to

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.560
work as a live streamer in China.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.000
Not to mention her husband.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.520
He's worse than her ex.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.440
[Her life is on the decline.]

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.680
[Excuse me, may I come in?]

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.760
Who was that just now?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.800
Mom?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.160
Hello, mom?

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.400
Xinying?

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.040
Hello?

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.640
Didn't you

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.000
see the "Do Not Disturb" sign?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.200
Why did you knock?

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.000
Would you like some bottled water?

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.120
No, thank you.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.320
The room is such a mess.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.600
Should I clean up?

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.120
No,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.600
thank you.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.160
Just close the door, please.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.720
Okay.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.120
[Alright.]

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.840
[Mom, I'm going to bed.]

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.320
[Once I'm done with this busy period,]

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.280
[I'll video call you.]

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.520
[Take care of yourselves, you and Dad.]

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.840
Okay.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.400
Well,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.880
go to sleep then.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.400
Talk to you later.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.240
[I really regret my choice back then.]

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.159
[I wish]

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:53.520
[I had a time machine]

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.400
[to take me back,]

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.760
[so I could choose again.]

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.440
[If I hadn't met that jerk,]

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.160
[I wouldn't have ended up in this mess.]

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.640
[Who would have thought that only]

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.680
[one month could change one's entire life?]

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.640
[I have to cling to the last sliver of hope.]

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.280
[If I can find that crooked lawyer]

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.520
[and that jerk, maybe I still]

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.960
[have a chance to go back.]

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.560
Welcome to FIB.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.440
Welcome to FIB.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.720
[Miss Lu.]

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.840
The bank closes at 4:00 p.m.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.960
Does that mean

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.000
you get off work at that time too?

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:56.880
Let's go for

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.960
Italian food after your work.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.200
Please take this

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.600
to the counter for the procedures.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.200
Thank you.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:34.880
Government bonds of

higher safety

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.240
are suitable

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.720
for long-term investment.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.480
I'd recommend GIC to you.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.480
This is also

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.280
a safe investment option.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.400
It has a flexible term, ranging from

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.400
several months to several years.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.600
[What are you talking about, girl?]

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.600
[I don't understand you.]

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.320
You talk too fast.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.440
I can't keep up.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.440
I don't understand Mandarin.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.800
Ma'am,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.480
excuse me.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.480
I am the branch

manager, Karen.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.120
I can explain it to you if you don't understand her.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.680
[Please follow me to the office]

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.440
[on the second floor.]

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.880
I'll create a detailed investment

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.640
plan for you.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.720
Okay.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:12.840
Hanna.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.120
[Can you help me to take care of this client?]

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:15.760
Sure.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.040
You speak Cantonese really well, girl.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.200
Thank you.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.200
This way, please.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.400
Okay. See you.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720
I'm coming soon.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.840
I've already told you

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.880
to send these clients

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.080
directly to my office.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.680
You don't know their needs.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.480
You even don't know their language.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.440
Learn some Cantonese.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.240
Remember this, Cynthia.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.680
Cantonese.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.360
[Yes, the transition period is already over.]

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.880
[Our branch is running pretty well.]

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.200
Yeah.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.760
Most of our clients

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.960
are Cantonese.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.080
[So, Sophie and I can handle them. Exactly.]

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.120
And you know, Chinese, right?

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.080
When you speak

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.240
their language, they think they're honored,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.000
and enjoy the interaction.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.720
Yeah, exactly.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.920
[So, I suggest]

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.320
[that you don't need that]

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.720
[Mandarin-speaking girl anymore.]

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.480
[Jennifer is learning Mandarin.]

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.840
[She can take her place.]

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.520
[I want to hire a new guy]

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.840
[who speaks Korean.]

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.480
[We don't need these interns]

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.520
[anymore.]

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.760
[Talk to you later.]

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.600
Bye.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.400
My dear.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.720
You're not allowed to loaf on the job like this.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.040
To be clear, I'm not your rich parent

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.040
and I won't tolerate such behavior.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.520
If I see this again,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.440
I'll definitely put it in your records.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.680
Now, go back to your work.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.480
You may also put this sentence

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.640
on your own record.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.240
Karen Dorman is a hypocrite.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.400
What?

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.000
What do you mean?

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.640
Do we have a problem here?

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.160
Go back to work, now!

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.440
I'm on my way.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.480
Emily and Aunt Zhang's niece

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.600
got their PR Visa

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.880
in the first year there.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.600
This is your third year.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.040
You can't blame me for this.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.800
I'm not blaming you.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.880
I'm just wondering how to

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.600
increase

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.120
your chances to get the visa.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.600
[Alright.]

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.160
[Xinying will get her visa this year.]

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.440
Thanks, Dad.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.480
How about this?

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.240
Bring your

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.200
tea leaves as a gift

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:58.960
to your manager

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.400
tomorrow when you go to work.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.240
[Her name's Karen, right?]

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.840
Mom, stop being ridiculous.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.560
That's not how things work here.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.720
[It's not about where you are.]

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.160
I tell you.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.240
It's about human nature.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.760
You can never be too polite.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.200
That chubby white guy

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.120
during your high school days

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:15.840
[loved]

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.320
[the local specialties I gave him.]

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.400
[That's why he took]

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.400
[special care of you.]

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.760
If you don't get your

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.200
PR Visa this year...

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.760
I don't want to jinx it,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.760
[but it's better]

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.800
[to be safe than sorry.]

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.040
[If you fail this time,]

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.040
[you'll need to renew your work visa.]

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.480
At least, you can build

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.400
connections by giving gifts.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.600
Yes, connections matter.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.960
[Your mom is right about it.]

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.160
I know.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.720
I believe in you.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.520
[Thank you, Dad.]

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.680
Dad, aren't you busy with work today?

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.080
[It's...]

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.360
It's fine.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.280
Xinying,

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.520
how do you get along

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.640
[with your manager?]

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.520
Karen is very kind to me.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.840
For any business

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.040
matters I don't understand,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.800
she immediately

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.280
takes over for me.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.840
She takes special care of me.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.560
Have you had dinner yet?

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.000
Yes.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.000
I just had dinner with

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.160
my coworker after work.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.560
Listen.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.920
Don't associate

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.800
with shady people.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:29.760
Don't go to

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.920

[Clear?]

[It's just a coworker.]

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.680
[We just had dinner.]

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.560
Don't worry, mom.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.040
I don't have

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.080
a single friend here.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.240
[My mom sent me]

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.880
[to Canada starting from my high school.]

It's called Zuminus.

Yeah.

It's always packed.

Yeah, no wonder.

Okay. Let's play it by ear.

Yes, at half past four.

Did you prepare the documents?

Okay. It's easier.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.200
Yes. My credit card, bad.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.240
Sorry. I can speak Chinese.

You're Chinese?

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.680
I just spent ages talking to that guy.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.840
This is your bank's credit card. It had

[automatic payments set up.]

[But since last month,]

The automatic payment deduction is down.

Do you have a debit card

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:49.960
from our bank?

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.800
They're all here.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.200
I remember you.

[Which one still works?]

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.720

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.760
what you bought and why.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.360
So the things you bought,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.400
I need to look at them

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.800

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:01.840
Also,

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.160
Still studying.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.640
Mr. Ge asked me to say

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.040
he wants you to graduate soon.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.200
Because after that,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.800
you pay your own living costs.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.520
He also told me

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.200
to pass this on:

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.920
keep a low profile,

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.000
don't show off.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.200
Got it.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.680
Okay, see you next time.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.160
Bye.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:36.920
Bye.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.640
Hello, actor.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.680
Your card's all set.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.600
I've set up

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.600
an auto payment alert.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.240
If next month

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.560
the payment doesn't go through,

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.520
the bank will send a text

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.200
to remind you.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.600
Okay, thank you.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.560
That's it?

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.480
What else?

00:26:59.240 --> 00:26:59.800
You helped me solve

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.680
such a big problem.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.960
How can I thank you?

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.640
It's okay.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.680
It's just my job.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.560
Let me buy you dinner.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.800
No, thanks.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.440
How about this:

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.080
come watch our play.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.960
We don't usually

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.760
invite people to rehearsals.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.560
You'll be the only one.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.960
Say whatever you think.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.800
Really, just don't be too harsh.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.800
Actors are all fragile.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.760
I'm very fragile, actually.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.840
Forget it, I've got things to do.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.400
Wait.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.320
Listen...

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.280
Hey, what are you doing?

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.240
Trying to fake it?

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.360
There's CCTV everywhere.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.800
You pulled me down.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.440
Nice.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.880
Hi, Cynthia.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.040
Let go.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:45.840
Hi, Cynthia.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.160
Get up, get up first.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.160
If you don't say yes,

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:49.800
I'm not getting up.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.120
Bye, Cynthia.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.680
Get up, come on.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.760
Bye-bye, Cynthia.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.080
Bye.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:58.680
Bye.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.800
Okay, okay, I agree.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.480
Now get up.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.800
Okay.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:04.680
Okay.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.200
But right now

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.600
I can't really get up.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.240
Give me a hand.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.040
My hand, my hand.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:17.960
I'm sorry.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.840
I lied to all of you.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.880
You asked me to drop my mask.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.360
But I don't even understand

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.280
what counts as a mask

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.280
and what is real.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.480
So how can I take it off?

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.800
My reason is simple.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.760
I just want to be different.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.000
Even just a little bit.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.320
If you force me to drop my mask,

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.040
I'll fight to keep it on.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.320
Because once it's gone,

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.000
I'll lose who I am.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.480
Stop eating, drink with me.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.200
Come on, have a drink.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.080
Come on, come on.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.520
Come on, come on, come on.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:20.920
So what do you think,

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.600
how we did today?

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.560
Good. Really good.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.960
You're not being objective.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.600
I'll ask Xinying.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.000
Xinying.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.280
You're this play's

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:27.880
very first audience member.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.440
What did you think?

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.040
Good.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.280
I think everyone's acting

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.160
was really great.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:32.680
Right?

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.080
She's praising you.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:33.600
What about the lines?

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.160
Yeah.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.160
I added the last line.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:35.840
How was that?

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.080
Ge Kaiyang.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.000
That last line,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:40.920
where did you see it?

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.640
It's from Zhuangzi.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.520
Zhuangzi.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.240
So pretentious.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:46.560
Zhuangzi.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.280
So, so pretentious.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.320
I think

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:51.960
this script

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.400
doesn't match your acting.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.560
You all act much better.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.440
Since you know scripts so well,

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.240
join us.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.680
Our drama club

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.720
still has a spot, right?

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.000
Yeah.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:02.800
We do.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:03.600
We do.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.120
Yeah.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.280
You work at the bank

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:05.760
every day, it's boring.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.360
Join us.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.200
Come on, join us.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.400
Chen Xi's right.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.480
I read people really well.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.360
Don't I?

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.120
I think you should, Xinying.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.120
You know, you really fit in.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.880
Well, I think your script

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.320
actually has quite a few bugs

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.320
in it.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.440
I don't really get it.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.240
Why would you

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.720
spend so much time and effort

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.920
and so much money,

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.520
when in the end

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.560
almost no one

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.760
might even watch this play.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:45.920
What's the point?

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:51.960
Does everything

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.360
have to have a meaning?

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.040
If it feels fun,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.040
just do it.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.120
Doing theatre

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.080
lets you escape reality

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.080
and feel free.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.080
Isn't that meaning enough?

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.080
As the fullest you,

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.400
shouldn't you

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.560
offer something up?

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.920
Ge Kaiyang, drink.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.200
I don't know why,

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.240
I'm suddenly so happy.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.280
I'm telling you,

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.320
what we're richest in...

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.600
[I was so naive.]

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.680
[Only now do I realize.]

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.760
[He keyed his PIN wrong on purpose]

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.040
[just to meet me.]

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.240
[Later, him on the bike at the bank]

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.800
[was part of his plan too.]

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.840
[He really knows how to play people.]

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.080
[He built a dream on that stage.]

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.160
[When you live in reality too long,]

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.760
[it's easy]

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.200
[to trust people in a dream.]

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.120
[So I believed him.]

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:54.840
[I told him]

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.200
[I really needed]

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.960
[permanent residency in Canada.]

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.240
[He immediately took me]

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.440
[to see a lawyer.]

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.200
[Kuang Dazhi.]

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.400
[He said one fee was enough]

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.840
[to fix the whole thing.]

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.080
[Sure enough,]

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.600
[my sponsorship came through fast.]

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.200
[The mission my mum gave me]

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.880
[was almost complete.]

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.160
[I finally felt relieved.]

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.640
Ge Kaiyang!

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.400
You're pinching my arm!

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.800
Is that fun?

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.520
Don't shout in just one ear!

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.360
Ge Kaiyang!

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.400
Look, I'm no good at this.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.240
You should skim the water.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.560
Look, it's flying now.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:13.920
Look.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.640
Let me ask you something.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.600
When this play is over,

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.560
what are you going to do?

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.280
Truth or Dare.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.480
Winner gets to ask.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.120
Go.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.320
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.920
I'm planning to buy an asteroid.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.920
Why not just buy the moon?

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.680
I really bought an asteroid

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.520
and named it after me.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:43.880
I also want,

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.080
after finals are over,

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:45.920
to throw a space-themed party.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.760
Come over then,

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:47.720
I'll show you the certificate.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.800
You rich kids and your lives,

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.840
we common folk can't relate.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.120
Do you think "rich kid"

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.080
is a nice label?

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.240
Who likes being labelled anyway?

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:01.680
Okay.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.960
But hey, your finals...

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.760
Aren't we about the same age?

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.120
You're in grad school, right?

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.560
That's the next question.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.280
Your turn.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:13.880
Okay.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.400
I'm playing scissors again.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.600
Then I'll go with rock.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.360
Bring it on.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.960
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:20.840
See?

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.400
I keep my word.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.639
Answer that.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.560
I'm definitely older than you.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:30.679
But who decided

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.280
life has to follow a schedule?

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.639
Some start university in their thirties or forties,

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:35.159
or in their fifties, sixties,

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:36.440
and still do masters and PhDs.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.920
Besides,

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:41.000
I did foundation and language courses,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.960
then changed my major.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.600
Seven years, give or take.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.880
You spent seven years on undergrad.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.800
I have my own

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.120
subjective and objective reasons.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.400
I'm going with rock again.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.480
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:34:59.720
Cheater.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:00.560
Go on.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.640
What are your subjective reasons?

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.040
Have you seen

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.280
"The Truman Show"?

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.080
If a person,

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:10.720
from birth,

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.200
has their whole life preplanned,

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:13.920
what happens to them?

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.200
Which primary school they go to,

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.920
which high school they attend,

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.000
when they go abroad,

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.400
when they have to return,

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.160
when they join the company,

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.760
what kind of spouse they find,

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.320
how many kids they have,

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.560
which hospital they use when ill,

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.080
which cemetery they end up in.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.720
If it were you,

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.560
what would you do?

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.040
Do you think he'd go mad?

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.160
I used to think in this world,

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.000
only my life was that scripted.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.880
Now I've found my kind.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.800
What about your parents?

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.080
They sent me here

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.320
for high school and university.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.400
My family...

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.640
maybe not selling everything,

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.600
but they really gave it all.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.520
They sold an apartment for me.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.160
Mum quit her job

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.600
and came here to stay with me.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.400
She's been here six years.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:22.960
Crazy, right?

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.440
It's another era now.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.240
Your parents really love you.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.720
They do love me too much.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.120
But that love is so heavy.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.600
All I can do now

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.440
is work, work, work,

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.800
and to become that

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.200
shining child they see in their minds.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.600
So back home,

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.320
they can hold their heads high

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.120
and be the ones

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.520
people talk about

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.560
as "successful parents".

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.360
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.200
Sometimes running away is okay.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.360
Do what I do.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.480
You really don't believe

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.320
someone can skip a stone seven times?

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.560
My grandpa.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.640
When I was little, my parents were busy,

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.800
so I lived with my grandparents.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.760
I saw it with my own eyes,

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.120
he really did it.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.040
He was unbeatable in Lucheng City.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.800
You really are from Lucheng City?

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:44.800
Yeah.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.520
I'm off. Bye-bye.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:56.840
Bye-bye.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.800
I've got a question for you.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.080
Go ahead.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.480
How about I pick you up tomorrow?

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.440
Four p.m. Don't stand me up.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:26.960
Okay.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.440
I'm heading off then, bye-bye.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.040
Bye-bye.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.080
Hello?

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:44.680
Young lady.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.240
Don't try to fool me.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.360
My credit card was stolen and used.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.240
If I don't go to the bank,

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.040
who else do I go to?

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.880
I've just explained to you,

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.280
your credit card

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.720
was issued by a card company.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.200
For things like fraud,

00:38:59.200 --> 00:38:59.880
you need to contact

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.480
the issuer to sort it out.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.800
We as the bank can't just

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.680
cancel the charge on our own.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.240
Don't play games with me.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.720
If you don't want to help,

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.640
just say so.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.800
If you don't know how,

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.200
get someone else who does.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.240
Stop standing here

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.320
wasting my time.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.680
It's okay.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.400
Your

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.640
work permit,

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.320
we might still find a way.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.480
What are you all doing here?

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.120
We can't find Ge Kaiyang.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.360
Have you tried his place?

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:38.920
None of us has been there.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.160
We don't even know

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.120
who he lives with.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.680
It's like he vanished.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.280
Don't stress yourself out.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.160
Sometimes running away is fine.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:51.520
Seriously.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.000
Learn from me.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.320
Maybe he just got hit by a car.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.720
[Chen Xi's work permit]

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.560
[has run into trouble.]

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.560
[The sponsor Kuang Dazhi]

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.640
[found got investigated.]

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.200
[Apparently]

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.200
[one single address]

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.400
[was used for over twenty]

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.200
[visa applications.]

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:12.720
[That sponsor]

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.720
[has already been arrested.]

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.760
[Chen Xi and the others' visas]

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.240
[are all facing cancellation.]

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:18.720
[Kuang Dazhi]

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.080
[has shut down his firm too,]

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.840
[probably to lie low.]

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.400
[No one knows where he is now.]

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.720
[I used to think in this world,]

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.760
only my life was that scripted.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.520
Now I've found my kind.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.400
Ms. Lu.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.440
Ms. Lu.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.440
So after that,

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.720
you never saw that Ge...

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.560
Ge Kaiyang.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:43.760
That lawyer Kuang

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.960
was the one he introduced to me.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.840
And that dodgy

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:47.560
private sponsorship,

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.000
they were the ones who fixed it up.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.720
None of this has anything to do with me.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.080
I knew nothing about it.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.600
Does that count as a defense?

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.800
In law,

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.480
this so-called

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.280
"private sponsorship"

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.280
does amount to visa fraud.

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.320
From what I hear,

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.960
you did know about it.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.000
No,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.440
I didn't know this

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.200
was against the law.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.640
But you did it, right?

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.840
Visa fraud is very serious.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.280
I know your situation.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.120
Your parents did so much

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.240
to get you here to Canada.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.480
You've had a work permit for three years.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.600
This year you had a real shot

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.080
at being picked for permanent residency.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.800
I do feel sorry for you.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.400
And I believe that in this matter,

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.600
you really were duped.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.000
But the law is the law.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.520
Whether it was intentional or not,

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.840
you've already broken it.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.080
So...

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.440
there's nothing I can do.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.440
Then can I sue them?

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.480
Sue that lawyer Kuang,

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.640
and that private sponsor,

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.400
and Ge Kaiyang.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.760
They were all in it together.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.840
I know you want your money back.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.480
You can go back and find them.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.920
Once you track them down,

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.280
get in touch with me online.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.160
I'll help you appeal as much as I can.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.680
But you do have to leave soon.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:57.800
[I went to a fast-food stall]

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.400
[outside the Chinese supermarket.]

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.000
[I ordered a bowl of malatang.]

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:02.840
[Once I finish this meal,]

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.800
[I'll be flying back home.]

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.360
[I've always felt]

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.240
[the malatang in Toronto]

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.880
[never tastes quite right.]

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.240
[I blamed it on the water.]

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.280
[But I never thought that, before leaving,]

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.240
[my last meal here]

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.240
[would still be malatang.]

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.280
[Malatang really is]

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.640
[a comfort for lonely souls.]

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.000
[The lawyer said if I find those two,]

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.200
[there's still a tiny bit of hope.]

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.680
[I think she was just comforting me.]

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.160
[How am I supposed to find them?]

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.800
[How do I face my mum?]

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.600
[How do I even face myself?]
