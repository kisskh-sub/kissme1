00:10.385 --> 00:11.845
Shit.

00:12.512 --> 00:13.805
Wait. Get help!

00:13.888 --> 00:15.265
Get help!

00:16.641 --> 00:18.309
-Get help!
-Guards!

00:18.393 --> 00:19.477
Guards!

00:19.811 --> 00:21.646
Get him to the infirmary, now!

00:25.567 --> 00:26.776
-I'm fine.
-I got you.

00:26.901 --> 00:29.654
-I'm... I'm fine.
-Just breathe.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.031
I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:35.577 --> 00:36.619
Well?

00:39.706 --> 00:40.707
We got it.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.672
Excuse me, sir.
What the hell just happened?

00:47.756 --> 00:48.882
All right.

00:49.507 --> 00:50.633
All right, Major.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.928
Looks like it's time
to give you some answers.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.820
It's okay.

01:16.283 --> 01:17.827
Your parents will be back soon.

01:18.536 --> 01:22.414
I'll be right outside in case
there are any more... problems.

01:31.299 --> 01:34.636
I shouldn't be here.
Everyone thinks I did this.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.847
It's okay. I told them you didn't.

01:39.515 --> 01:40.767
What'd you say?

01:41.351 --> 01:43.895
That my glasses broke and they cut my eye

01:43.978 --> 01:46.606
and you were only trying to help me
when everyone showed up.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.946
They'd probably send me to Juniper Hill

01:53.446 --> 01:55.156
if I told them what I really saw.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.916
I'm so sorry, Lil.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.419
I should have believed you.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.590
You're my best friend...

02:14.509 --> 02:15.593
and I let you down.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.145
Why is this happening?

02:27.355 --> 02:29.149
We're still trying to figure that out.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.614
Is it gonna happen again?

02:40.577 --> 02:41.786
I don't know.

02:43.079 --> 02:44.914
But if it does...

02:47.333 --> 02:48.626
you won't be alone.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.929
I missed you.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.557
I really missed you too.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.811
Is Marge okay? It looked pretty bad.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.731
Her eye's a little messed up,
but she'll be okay.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.483
Look, if she wants to help,

03:12.567 --> 03:14.819
then she can tell Bowers
what really happened.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.448
Ronnie, we've tried that already.

03:19.115 --> 03:20.450
Why would they believe her?

03:20.533 --> 03:23.786
Besides, the police
probably think I attacked her,

03:24.287 --> 03:25.872
that she's covering for me.

03:25.954 --> 03:27.207
Everyone thinks that.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.924
No, Lilly, that's not what I meant.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.926
Listen, I mean, not us,

03:38.009 --> 03:41.679
but like at school,
the post office, my barber.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.864
This is a private club, announce yourself.

04:14.462 --> 04:15.588
Matty?

04:19.175 --> 04:22.345
Help... me.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.584
The Indians call them "pillars."

06:19.087 --> 06:21.255
Thirteen objects carved
from the same material

06:21.339 --> 06:23.257
that that thing apparently
fell to Earth on.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.343
"Fell to Earth"?

06:26.344 --> 06:28.805
They were buried hundreds
of years ago deep underground

06:28.888 --> 06:31.224
by the Sqoteawapskot tribe
in order to create a sort of...

06:31.766 --> 06:33.683
cage around the creature's territory.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.271
One that runs more or less
along the borders of modern-day Derry.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.984
You're telling me that Derry's a prison

06:42.568 --> 06:44.028
and we're looking for the bars?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.488
Exactly right, Major.

06:48.157 --> 06:49.200
That kid...

06:50.243 --> 06:53.371
is a member of a secret order
dedicated to keeping that thing locked up

06:53.454 --> 06:54.747
and those pillars hidden.

06:55.456 --> 06:58.292
A job that he and his pals
have succeeded at for nearly 400 years.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.044
Until now.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.423
Hallorann flipped through that boy's mind
like it was the morning paper.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.967
Now we know exactly where they are

07:06.050 --> 07:07.260
and how to get to them.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.138
To do what, sir?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.224
To reduce the size of its cage.

07:13.891 --> 07:14.892
To contain it.

07:17.061 --> 07:18.604
You mean to capture it.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.361
29 Neibolt Street.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.030
It's an abandoned home
atop a tunnel system

07:28.114 --> 07:29.991
that leads directly to the 13 pillars.

07:30.700 --> 07:34.579
Tomorrow morning, you and Colonel Fuller
will lead a small team to secure them.

07:34.662 --> 07:35.746
Once in hand,

07:35.830 --> 07:37.832
you'll tighten the perimeter
enough to control it.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.501
Imagine if we had dropped
something like this

07:40.585 --> 07:42.378
on the Pusan Perimeter in '51.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.631
Let it do the job we lost so many GIs to.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.843
How many mothers we could have
spared from heartbreak.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.804
It's time to bring this Cold War
to an end, Major.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.099
What's the problem, son?

07:58.227 --> 07:59.270
You knew

08:00.104 --> 08:01.939
that Derry was this thing's
hunting ground,

08:02.023 --> 08:03.774
and you let me move my family here.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.277
The plan was for you to stay on base.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.653
You chose otherwise.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.281
Maybe now you move them here
until this is all done with.

08:10.364 --> 08:11.782
There's no maybe about it.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.747
Excuse me, sir.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.551
Matty, where have you been?

08:37.433 --> 08:38.518
It's okay.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.645
-You don't have to--
-In the sewers...

08:42.145 --> 08:43.231
below Derry.

08:45.816 --> 08:46.984
That's where it lives.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.239
The clown.

08:51.739 --> 08:52.782
Clown?

08:55.576 --> 08:57.245
It kept some of us alive...

08:58.579 --> 08:59.747
like...

09:00.873 --> 09:02.166
like it needed...

09:03.376 --> 09:04.418
Fear.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.420
Yeah.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.384
How did you get away?

09:14.762 --> 09:16.222
It feeds at night...

09:17.848 --> 09:19.141
and sleeps in the day.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.020
And I just waited...

09:24.021 --> 09:25.022
and I ran.

09:27.149 --> 09:30.903
What about Teddy and Phil and Susie?

09:31.821 --> 09:32.989
Did you see them?

09:34.615 --> 09:36.784
Teddy was dead when it dragged him in.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.831
His skull was ripped open and it...

09:42.957 --> 09:44.542
It... It what?

09:46.669 --> 09:48.462
Ate his brains right in front of me.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.465
I think I'm gonna be sick.

09:52.550 --> 09:56.429
And Susie, one of her arms was gone.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.473
It just left her there.

10:01.642 --> 10:04.478
All night, bleeding out...

10:06.230 --> 10:07.273
and crying.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.696
Until she stopped.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.118
But Phil...

10:20.036 --> 10:21.454
he's still down there.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.040
He's alive?

10:24.999 --> 10:27.668
He can't talk or move, but...

10:28.878 --> 10:31.881
he's alive, somehow.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.300
We have to go to the police.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.762
No. No police.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.472
I have to get my dad out.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.557
And you can tell them
that he didn't take you.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.602
And Phil. Matty, we have to help him.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.271
No cops.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.482
-Matty, please.
-No.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.777
They'd send me back, back to my dad.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.156
I ran away once, I will do it again.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.495
I'd sooner go back
to the sewers than there.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.168
Obviously, the loss of even one life

11:09.251 --> 11:10.711
is one life too many.

11:12.463 --> 11:16.842
That said, the cycle has been
a lot milder than '35 and '08.

11:19.095 --> 11:22.932
Twenty-five disappearances,
seven confirmed deaths,

11:23.474 --> 11:26.686
mostly children, the oldest 16...

11:27.770 --> 11:29.230
and the youngest 5.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.816
One encouraging sign

11:32.400 --> 11:34.694
is obviously we know the creature sheds.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.198
Its discharge, you might call it,

11:39.281 --> 11:41.909
has tainted Derry's groundwater
since the town's founding.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.412
Just get on with it, John.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.538
I'm sorry.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.998
Should we not be educating
our prospective keeper?

11:48.833 --> 11:50.084
Leo.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.086
Go on, John.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.463
Well, lately our scouts have noted

11:54.547 --> 11:57.466
that the residents have been
acting more aggressively.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.551
The Augury!

11:59.552 --> 12:00.678
Exactly.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.555
And what is that, dear?

12:03.764 --> 12:07.977
One last big, bloody event
that marks the end of a cycle,

12:08.936 --> 12:10.229
after which,

12:10.312 --> 12:12.732
we get another 27 years
or so of peace and quiet.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.068
Miss Rose.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.196
You're late. Where's Taniel?

12:21.198 --> 12:22.283
I couldn't stop him.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.144
Sir, please let me speak to him.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.689
All aboard the Shawshank Express.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.112
Well, your savior
better work fast, Grogan.

13:00.988 --> 13:03.741
Last fish we sent in there
didn't survive the week.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.954
Maybe if you're lucky, you'll survive two.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.879
Burn in hell, you son of a bitch!

13:19.507 --> 13:20.591
Get off of me!

13:22.176 --> 13:23.427
You're a dead man.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.137
You're a dead man, Grogan, you hear me?

13:25.262 --> 13:28.224
You're gonna fry
for what you did to my kids,

13:28.307 --> 13:30.100
you piece of shit!

13:30.726 --> 13:31.811
Get off of me!

13:32.978 --> 13:34.188
I didn't do it!

13:53.624 --> 13:54.959
Sit down.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.299
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.301
I'm just a little shaken up is all.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.305
He's on his way there now.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.599
I just wanted to make sure
we got the paperwork in

14:10.683 --> 14:12.810
so we could...
we could get him with his family

14:12.893 --> 14:15.229
as quickly as possible
until we get a defense.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.815
All right, so you'll let me know. Okay.

14:17.898 --> 14:18.941
All right, thanks so much.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.192
All right, bye-bye.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.989
Is Will here? Where's Will?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.408
In his room. What's wrong?

14:31.495 --> 14:33.122
I gotta tell you something.

14:33.205 --> 14:36.375
Okay? And as crazy as it's going to sound,

14:36.458 --> 14:40.379
I really need you to just believe me.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.134
The National Guard was standing by

14:45.217 --> 14:47.219
in Leflore County, Mississippi yesterday

14:47.303 --> 14:51.015
during a demonstration
for Negro voting rights, during which...

14:51.140 --> 14:52.933
General? There's somebody here to see you.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.560
-Not now.
-With respect, sir,

14:54.643 --> 14:55.728
I think you're gonna want--

14:56.186 --> 14:58.647
Where is my nephew, Francis?

14:58.731 --> 14:59.815
Rose.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.775
He's safe.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.280
Once our operation is complete,
he'll be released.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.574
-You have my word.
-Your word?

15:09.325 --> 15:10.826
"Water pipelines"?

15:12.453 --> 15:14.747
I told you that my memories
of Derry came back

15:14.830 --> 15:16.040
when I first got here.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.542
That wasn't entirely true.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.210
No shit.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.630
Five years ago,

15:23.464 --> 15:26.008
I was administered a drug
by the Department of Defense

15:26.091 --> 15:29.803
as part of a security protocol,
and it all came rushing back.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.223
Every detail of that summer we shared...

15:34.975 --> 15:36.727
for the first time in 45 years.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.065
What was that thing?

15:42.191 --> 15:43.609
Why can't it leave the woods?

15:49.323 --> 15:50.616
Can you keep a secret?

15:56.538 --> 15:58.207
I remember you saved my life

15:58.874 --> 16:01.001
from something that shouldn't exist.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.345
After I processed
everything that had happened

16:11.428 --> 16:13.847
and everything you told me
about your ancestors

16:13.931 --> 16:15.975
and their sacred responsibility,

16:16.475 --> 16:19.436
I realized I was sitting
on the answer to a question

16:19.520 --> 16:21.438
that has plagued me my entire life.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.233
How to keep this country safe?

16:28.988 --> 16:32.449
You think you can put a leash
on this thing?

16:34.410 --> 16:37.621
It can't be controlled, Francis.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.500
We'll see.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.216
You wouldn't be doing any of this

16:49.299 --> 16:51.343
if you really remembered everything.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.972
What it's like
to look it right in the eye.

16:57.891 --> 17:00.185
Feel its breath on your neck.

17:01.895 --> 17:06.358
You would pack up
this entire operation and run.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.819
We know how to find the pillars.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.988
Taniel told us everything.

17:11.070 --> 17:12.448
He would never do that.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.575
Neibolt House, Rose.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.327
The tunnels below Neibolt.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.295
In that case...

17:29.173 --> 17:30.507
you'll need my help.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.886
That's out of the question, Rose.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.388
Francis.

17:47.775 --> 17:51.195
At the very least, let me prepare Taniel.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.449
Your lives depend on it.

18:19.556 --> 18:20.682
Taniel.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.684
-Aunt Rose!
-Are you okay?

18:22.768 --> 18:24.770
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to get caught.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.480
I know you didn't.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.776
You're hurt. What did you...

18:38.075 --> 18:39.701
They did something to me.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.789
Went into my mind.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.959
Into my head, into my memories.
I don't know how, but--

18:47.084 --> 18:48.168
Hey, hey, hey.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.486
English!

19:17.072 --> 19:18.157
I told them...

19:19.199 --> 19:21.160
that you'll have a better chance
of helping them find

19:21.243 --> 19:22.452
what they're looking for...

19:25.080 --> 19:26.081
with this.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.837
They've inspected it.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.590
They know it poses no threat.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.467
And they understand
that you are the only one

19:37.551 --> 19:38.719
who knows how to use it.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.310
Yes, Auntie.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.188
I understand.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.398
I'll take that.

19:53.817 --> 19:54.985
I'll take that.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.322
You won't need it till the morning.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.700
Time's up.

20:06.371 --> 20:07.497
Let's go.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.250
Do what they say.

20:13.003 --> 20:16.215
Keep it close and you'll be safe, okay?

20:44.451 --> 20:45.452
Identification.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.959
The base is far enough outside of town.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.252
You all should be safe with me

20:53.335 --> 20:55.212
-till the assignment's done.
-But, Dad,

20:55.337 --> 20:56.880
what about my friends? They need me.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.466
You'll see your friends
when this is all over.

20:59.549 --> 21:00.759
You're free to go.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.928
Trust me now. I'm taking care of it.

21:19.027 --> 21:20.237
Lilly?

21:20.737 --> 21:22.864
You said if I ever needed to talk...

21:25.617 --> 21:26.618
Come on in.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.621
Okay, so you're telling me
there's a chance

21:29.705 --> 21:31.415
that boy's still alive?

21:31.498 --> 21:32.666
Matty thinks so.

21:33.166 --> 21:36.295
But he won't go to the cops
'cause he's afraid they'll send him home.

21:36.378 --> 21:38.714
Oh God, what that poor boy's been through.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.185
Hi, Mr. Kersh.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.896
Dear, you remember Lilly.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.482
Terri Bainbridge's kid.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.401
Yes, sir.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.112
Where's my steak?

22:02.654 --> 22:03.739
It's almost done.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.574
I'll bring it to you in a minute.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.909
Don't overcook it again.

22:17.127 --> 22:20.339
If someone has that kid,
we have to go to the police.

22:20.422 --> 22:23.300
-No, I promised Matty.
-This is grownup business.

22:23.383 --> 22:25.427
It's not like
you can go down there yourself.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.305
I think we can save Phil.

22:29.097 --> 22:32.225
Lilly, you're not thinking straight.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.978
Promise me that you won't go down there.

22:36.229 --> 22:40.025
Friends or not,
it's not worth you dying too.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.819
Promise me.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.114
Promise.

22:52.412 --> 22:56.083
Well... it's not so bad, right?

22:57.709 --> 22:59.544
A little smaller than our house,

22:59.628 --> 23:01.630
but it'll do for now, right?

23:05.258 --> 23:06.718
Can I go for a walk?

23:07.260 --> 23:09.805
Thought I'd explore the base
if I gotta be stuck here.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.557
Yeah.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.852
I'm sure there's a rec center, darts...

23:16.853 --> 23:18.605
you know? Will...

23:20.524 --> 23:23.693
You'll see your friends again,
as soon as your daddy says it's safe.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.946
I love you.

23:27.823 --> 23:28.990
I love you.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.245
Local resident William Drivens

23:33.328 --> 23:36.832
was arrested for trying
to chop down one of its legs

23:37.249 --> 23:38.250
with an axe.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.215
In other news,

23:45.298 --> 23:48.635
a prison bus en route
to Shawshank Penitentiary

23:48.718 --> 23:51.471
crashed yesterday off Route 9.

23:51.555 --> 23:55.559
Sources on the scene confirmed
there were multiple casualties.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.894
And one of the passengers,

23:57.978 --> 24:01.022
notorious murder suspect Hank Grogan,

24:01.106 --> 24:03.316
is believed to have escaped.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.110
-Roads may be blocked...
-Oh my God.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.903
...as searches take effect,

24:06.987 --> 24:08.321
-and police are asking...
-Oh dear.

24:08.405 --> 24:12.659
...anyone with information
to contact the DPD tipline.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.995
If you're on the west side today,

24:15.078 --> 24:16.913
you might notice that the streets

24:16.997 --> 24:19.624
between Center and Neibolt
have been closed off

24:19.708 --> 24:21.793
due to a reported gas main leak.

24:22.294 --> 24:26.256
Authorities are urging residents
to steer clear of the area today.

24:53.200 --> 24:56.369
I've been trying for days now
to get this thing on Main Street.

24:57.370 --> 24:59.206
I've lost nine already.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.792
It's always the wind, man.

25:02.876 --> 25:03.919
Always...

25:08.798 --> 25:10.509
What's she doing here?

25:10.592 --> 25:11.927
I just want to help.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.346
I'm supposed to trust a Pattycake?

25:14.429 --> 25:15.430
Ex.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.724
Hey. It came for her too.

25:19.059 --> 25:23.104
Look, I thought about it.
And we can't make Matty go to the police.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.899
-What?
-They won't believe him.

25:25.982 --> 25:27.108
And he's right.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.027
They'll send him right back to his dad.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.905
But if Phil's really alive

25:32.739 --> 25:34.658
and can prove your dad is innocent...

25:36.243 --> 25:38.036
then we have to go save him ourselves.

25:38.119 --> 25:39.496
-Are you insane?
-No way.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.707
I'm not going down there again.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.919
You said yourself, you'd sooner go back
to the sewers than home.

25:46.419 --> 25:49.381
Well, good, 'cause you're gonna
take us down there right now

25:49.464 --> 25:52.717
and show us exactly where Phil is,
and we're gonna get him out of there.

25:54.761 --> 25:57.556
Either that, or we drag you to the cops.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.891
Right now, all of us.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.644
We can't go down there. We'll get eaten.

26:03.353 --> 26:04.813
Not if we have these.

26:05.772 --> 26:08.400
-"Mommy's Little Helper"?
-Exactly.

26:08.775 --> 26:11.444
What Will and Matty said
about it feeding on fear?

26:12.404 --> 26:15.657
Well, if it's got nothing to feed on,
then we have nothing to worry about.

26:16.324 --> 26:17.617
My mom got a refill.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.703
We'll each take as many as we can.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.246
Are you sure that's safe?

26:21.329 --> 26:23.373
My mom eats these like M&Ms.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.501
If they weren't safe,
she'd probably be dead by now.

26:27.794 --> 26:28.878
I don't know.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.049
Listen.

26:33.925 --> 26:36.636
My dad used to say, "In life,

26:36.720 --> 26:38.722
people are either anchors or lifeboats."

26:39.556 --> 26:41.891
"They drag you under
or they keep you afloat."

26:44.853 --> 26:47.105
I don't know where I'd be
right now without you guys.

26:48.064 --> 26:51.151
But Phil? He doesn't have anyone.

26:51.901 --> 26:54.237
And if we don't do something,
he won't stand a chance.

26:56.364 --> 27:01.453
So my question is,
are you an anchor or a lifeboat?

27:04.247 --> 27:05.290
Lifeboat.

27:06.082 --> 27:07.083
Lifeboat.

27:14.507 --> 27:15.717
Lifeboat?

27:27.937 --> 27:30.023
What? What'd I miss?

27:31.232 --> 27:32.567
You don't want to know.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.572
According to our friends
from Indian Marsh,

27:38.114 --> 27:41.159
the house on Neibolt Street
was built atop an old ground well

27:41.242 --> 27:42.786
that dates back to colonial days.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.081
-Clear!
-Clear!

27:46.164 --> 27:49.459
The objects we're looking for,
13 Indian artifacts

27:49.542 --> 27:51.461
that the natives refer to as pillars,

27:51.878 --> 27:53.421
were buried centuries ago

27:53.505 --> 27:55.924
and in different locations around Derry,

27:56.007 --> 27:57.717
and are now only accessible

27:57.801 --> 28:00.303
through the sewers
directly beneath that old well.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.765
Major Hanlon and his team
will secure the house,

28:03.848 --> 28:06.476
find the well, and descend
into the sewer system

28:06.559 --> 28:08.937
where our guide, Taniel,
will lead us through the tunnels

28:09.020 --> 28:10.522
to the location of the pillars.

28:10.814 --> 28:13.400
If necessary,
with the assistance of Private Hallorann.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.533
All right, boys. Down the hatch.

28:24.119 --> 28:27.288
But remember, gentlemen,
you'll be in enemy territory.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.499
Whatever form this enemy takes,

28:29.582 --> 28:32.085
it will use your own
personal fears against you.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.796
Don't freeze, don't trust it.

28:35.296 --> 28:37.799
If you see something
that by any rational measure

28:37.882 --> 28:40.093
should not be down there, shoot it.

28:40.677 --> 28:44.806
Be vigilant, stay safe,
and secure the assets.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.312
This way.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.607
Can you feel it?

28:55.817 --> 28:57.152
I feel something.

29:23.678 --> 29:24.846
Dick.

29:29.392 --> 29:30.769
Y'all hear that?

29:30.852 --> 29:31.853
Hear what?

29:59.589 --> 30:01.299
Taniel! Are you all right?

30:01.800 --> 30:02.926
Yeah.

30:03.802 --> 30:04.928
Big drop.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.280
Dick!

30:24.989 --> 30:26.115
Baby!

30:29.994 --> 30:31.830
Come on, go. We're gonna fall behind.

31:08.992 --> 31:09.993
Where is he?

31:13.496 --> 31:14.664
Hallorann!

31:17.292 --> 31:18.334
Hallorann!

31:24.424 --> 31:25.466
Where the hell'd he go?

31:25.550 --> 31:27.677
I don't know!
He went down and didn't come up.

31:46.946 --> 31:48.239
Dickie.

31:49.365 --> 31:51.534
He's coming for you again.

31:53.661 --> 31:54.704
Grandma?

32:21.773 --> 32:22.899
Grandpa.

32:23.524 --> 32:24.692
Hey, Dickie.

32:26.611 --> 32:27.862
It's time.

32:28.821 --> 32:30.198
Hallorann!

32:32.033 --> 32:33.409
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

32:34.077 --> 32:35.078
Did you hear that?

32:36.704 --> 32:37.872
Hallorann! That you?

33:13.282 --> 33:14.909
I...

33:15.535 --> 33:17.203
want...

33:17.912 --> 33:19.706
you!

33:19.789 --> 33:21.541
Fire!

33:25.378 --> 33:26.546
The hell?

33:30.008 --> 33:31.009
Hallorann!

33:31.968 --> 33:33.094
Hallorann!

33:58.244 --> 34:01.330
We should all take three.
That should be enough.

34:13.426 --> 34:14.635
It's kinda bitter.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.304
Better than getting kinda eaten.

34:18.764 --> 34:19.849
Okay.

34:20.975 --> 34:22.018
Lead the way.

35:02.475 --> 35:03.601
We're close now.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.062
What do you say, Hallorann? That right?

35:10.066 --> 35:11.275
Major Hanlon?

35:12.777 --> 35:14.487
Shit! Taniel!

35:15.154 --> 35:17.949
Stop! Taniel!

35:24.413 --> 35:26.457
Making a big mistake now!

35:27.333 --> 35:29.043
Son of a bitch!

35:39.262 --> 35:40.388
This way.

35:47.645 --> 35:48.813
Y'all are cute.

35:50.231 --> 35:51.858
Talking to each other with your minds,

35:52.525 --> 35:53.818
keeping secrets from me.

35:55.319 --> 35:58.823
I may not have had the gift,
but I ain't no dummy.

36:00.032 --> 36:02.869
I know everything
that that bitch told you.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.203
Don't listen to him.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.997
He's trying to get in your head.

36:06.497 --> 36:07.540
"Dickie."

36:08.291 --> 36:09.792
"Lock 'em away

36:09.876 --> 36:11.419
in a little box in your mind,

36:11.502 --> 36:13.004
and then throw away the key."

36:13.129 --> 36:15.089
He gonna hurt you, baby.
Don't listen to him.

36:15.298 --> 36:16.841
She don't understand like we do.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.760
Power like this is meant to be used.

36:19.844 --> 36:20.928
No.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.139
How'd you find that?

36:23.973 --> 36:25.224
How you...

36:25.308 --> 36:26.809
How you find my box?

36:27.643 --> 36:28.853
It was right there.

36:29.478 --> 36:30.646
In the...

36:31.063 --> 36:32.773
In the sphincter of your soul.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.525
You know what's in there, boy.

36:34.609 --> 36:35.610
Don't let him open it!

36:35.693 --> 36:38.487
Nowhere you can bury it
that I can't find! You hear me?

36:38.571 --> 36:40.156
They're gonna get you, Dickie.

36:40.239 --> 36:41.657
Keep that box closed.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.576
Let it all go. Come on, boy. Open it up.

36:43.659 --> 36:45.870
-I ain't opening shit.
-I ain't telling you one more time.

36:45.953 --> 36:48.122
-Open up the damn box.
-I ain't opening shit.

36:48.247 --> 36:50.082
-Open the damn box!
-No!

36:50.166 --> 36:51.542
You're gonna have to put that back

36:51.667 --> 36:53.336
where you got that from,
'cause I'm not opening it.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.630
-Or you're gonna what?
-I'm gonna f...

36:56.130 --> 36:58.341
Or you'll what? Or you'll what?

36:58.633 --> 36:59.800
Or you'll what?

37:04.513 --> 37:05.514
Grandma!

37:05.598 --> 37:06.849
What you gonna do, huh?

37:08.100 --> 37:09.727
What you gonna do, boy?

37:10.478 --> 37:11.729
You won't open it?

37:12.396 --> 37:14.023
-We'll open it together.
-No.

37:14.106 --> 37:15.650
-On the count of three. Ready?
-Stop.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.610
Stop. Stop.

37:18.319 --> 37:19.987
-Put it down.
-One.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.031
Don't do that. Don't do that.
Don't do that. Don't do that.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.075
Stop. Stop. Stop.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.035
Don't do that!

37:26.911 --> 37:29.038
-Stop.
-Two.

37:29.121 --> 37:30.498
No. Don't do that!

37:30.581 --> 37:32.667
Leave it alone! Leave it alone!

37:32.750 --> 37:34.001
What is that? What are you?

37:34.085 --> 37:35.544
What are you doing?

37:35.628 --> 37:36.963
Get out of here.

37:37.046 --> 37:38.923
Leave me alone. Get out.

37:39.006 --> 37:40.633
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Three.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.703
I think I took too many pills.

38:10.746 --> 38:12.999
Maybe we did take too many pills.

38:13.916 --> 38:15.042
What'd you say?

38:16.460 --> 38:17.837
What?

38:18.421 --> 38:19.588
What?

38:20.923 --> 38:22.091
Are you okay?

38:23.009 --> 38:24.677
Sorry I'm so slow.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.430
I can't see too well in the dark.

38:28.389 --> 38:29.890
Here, take my hand.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.604
Your hand is really soft.

38:35.688 --> 38:38.899
Oh, well, I borrow
my mom's Noxzema sometimes.

38:39.483 --> 38:42.028
No, I mean super-duper soft.

38:42.611 --> 38:44.822
Like a kitty cat's belly.

38:45.531 --> 38:47.658
That's a really weird thing to say.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.911
Are you guys feeling this?

38:51.454 --> 38:54.832
It's like that time I went to Dr. Wagner's

38:54.915 --> 38:57.418
and his hygienist gave me this gas,

38:57.501 --> 39:01.005
and I thought I was floating
right out of my...

39:03.132 --> 39:05.092
Are you two holding hands?

39:05.718 --> 39:07.678
-No.
-Yeah.

39:09.638 --> 39:10.806
We're getting close.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.146
Jesus Christ, it smells like shit in here.

39:17.229 --> 39:18.397
It's the sewers, Pauly.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.066
What did you think
it was gonna smell like?

39:22.109 --> 39:23.652
-Where the hell are they?
-I don't know.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.154
We must have got
turned around somewhere.

39:25.237 --> 39:26.947
-What are you saying, we're lost?
-I don't know.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.157
Shit!

39:28.491 --> 39:30.326
-Hello?
-Hey, calm down.

39:30.409 --> 39:32.203
I'm calm. I'm perfectly calm.
Don't I sound calm?

39:32.286 --> 39:33.287
Not really.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.041
Is it hot?

39:39.001 --> 39:40.586
Jesus Christ. I'm burning up.

39:41.712 --> 39:43.381
It's a goddamn furnace down here.
You're not hot?

39:43.506 --> 39:46.217
Pauly, I'm hot. It's hot. Take it easy.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.718
Why can't we find them, huh?

39:47.802 --> 39:49.553
I feel like something's wrong, man.
I got a feeling.

39:49.637 --> 39:52.765
Listen, we'll catch up to the others,
or we'll find our own way out.

39:52.848 --> 39:54.517
Either way, we gotta
keep moving, all right?

39:54.600 --> 39:56.227
-So, let's just move.
-All right.

39:56.310 --> 39:57.645
-Yeah?
-All right, all right.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.063
Leroy!

40:01.023 --> 40:02.525
What, what? What is it?

40:07.655 --> 40:09.115
Lee, what are you looking at?

40:10.741 --> 40:12.284
Leroy, help!

40:12.368 --> 40:13.494
I'm scared!

40:14.578 --> 40:15.913
Charlotte?

40:15.996 --> 40:17.623
I want to go home, Lee. I'm scared!

40:19.041 --> 40:20.709
Charlotte, what the hell
are you doing down here?

40:23.337 --> 40:24.630
Who the fuck you talking to?

40:26.966 --> 40:27.967
Pauly, you can't see her?

40:28.717 --> 40:30.219
See who? Are you fucking with me?

40:30.302 --> 40:32.096
Put your gun down, baby. I'm scared.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.682
What the fuck?

40:34.765 --> 40:35.891
Can we go home, Lee?

40:35.975 --> 40:37.476
Steady that light, Russo.
Steady that light.

40:37.643 --> 40:39.437
-It's not me, it's the battery.
-Let's go home, Lee!

40:39.520 --> 40:41.021
Mine's off too. Change yours. Hurry up!

40:41.105 --> 40:43.274
-Get yours on!
-What the fuck am I supposed to do?

40:50.406 --> 40:52.116
The fuck was that? What are you doing?

40:53.367 --> 40:54.493
Lee?

41:21.520 --> 41:22.938
Hey, what the hell is going on?

41:23.022 --> 41:24.064
Hey!

41:25.024 --> 41:27.026
-Lee, what the hell is going on?
-Hey!

41:27.109 --> 41:28.110
Listen, listen.

41:28.194 --> 41:30.946
Whatever you see down here
that's not supposed to be here,

41:31.030 --> 41:32.031
you fucking kill it.

41:32.114 --> 41:34.033
It doesn't fucking matter
if it's your first girlfriend,

41:34.158 --> 41:36.202
your high school gym teacher,
you fucking kill 'em.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.286
-You got it?
-All right.

41:37.369 --> 41:39.079
-Pauly!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it, I got it.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.873
-Kill my gym teacher. I got it.
-Okay, let's go.

41:40.956 --> 41:42.082
All right.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.668
Freakin' me out.

42:12.863 --> 42:14.240
Looks like a dead end.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.033
I...

42:17.368 --> 42:19.828
I could've sworn it was right.

42:20.621 --> 42:22.081
Hallorann!

42:25.626 --> 42:27.628
-You hear that?
-Hallorann!

42:27.711 --> 42:28.921
Voices.

42:30.631 --> 42:32.299
There's someone else down here.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.178
We should go back.

42:41.767 --> 42:43.102
Oh my God!

42:43.185 --> 42:45.813
It's Susie. Oh my God.

42:49.775 --> 42:50.901
Teddy!

42:52.987 --> 42:54.238
Oh my God!

42:54.321 --> 42:55.739
Is that Phil?

42:56.115 --> 42:57.616
He's dead!

42:58.242 --> 43:01.161
All of the tunnels
Are underground

43:01.245 --> 43:03.998
Where none of the children
Will ever be found

43:05.749 --> 43:08.168
They wandered away
To join the show

43:08.252 --> 43:10.796
And lost their way
In the world below

43:10.879 --> 43:12.881
They swallowed the pills
And they lost their fear

43:13.048 --> 43:14.466
But nothing they hoped to find was here

43:14.508 --> 43:15.634
That's Matty!

43:15.718 --> 43:18.012
They joined the circus
And left their town

43:18.095 --> 43:21.223
Now they live here
Down with the clown

43:21.307 --> 43:23.517
-Down with the clown
-With the clown

43:23.601 --> 43:25.603
Down here with the clown

43:25.686 --> 43:27.688
Now they live down here

43:27.771 --> 43:30.190
With the clown!

43:33.193 --> 43:35.696
Duck and cover, kiddos.

43:50.127 --> 43:51.754
Guys, wait up!

44:03.641 --> 44:05.059
Help!

44:10.439 --> 44:11.649
Help!

44:13.651 --> 44:15.778
Can anyone hear me?

44:23.661 --> 44:24.787
I see him too.

44:24.870 --> 44:27.456
It's me! Dad!

44:27.539 --> 44:28.707
He's real.

44:31.335 --> 44:32.544
Leroy, he's real!

44:38.425 --> 44:39.510
Shit!

44:39.593 --> 44:41.595
Shit. Fuck.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.097
Shit.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.391
-Fuck.
-All right.

44:47.309 --> 44:48.894
What the hell are you all doing here?

44:48.977 --> 44:51.772
Get behind me! Behind me! Move it!

44:54.775 --> 44:57.069
I got you. I got you. I got you.

44:58.904 --> 45:00.114
-Is it bad?
-Just look at me.

45:00.197 --> 45:01.865
-Is it bad?
-No, it's not. It's not bad, brother.

45:01.949 --> 45:03.158
Not bad? Yeah, it's fucking bad.

45:03.242 --> 45:04.284
-It's not bad.
-It's bad.

45:04.368 --> 45:05.869
-I just-- We're gonna patch you up.
-Yeah.

45:05.994 --> 45:08.080
So, I can get you out of here
and we're gonna patch you up.

45:08.163 --> 45:09.707
-And so, let's go.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

45:09.790 --> 45:10.958
-What?
-I wanna rest.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.626
-Let me rest.
-No. Fuck that. You can't rest.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.420
-We gotta get out of here.
-Let me rest. No.

45:14.503 --> 45:16.088
No, listen. We gotta get
the fuck out of here.

45:16.171 --> 45:18.132
-Hey, hey. Lee. Lee.
-I got you. What? What?

45:19.508 --> 45:21.510
It's okay. It's okay.

45:22.636 --> 45:23.846
What?

45:24.555 --> 45:25.723
It's my turn.

45:26.306 --> 45:27.307
It's my turn.

45:27.975 --> 45:28.976
I'm sorry.

45:36.817 --> 45:38.610
-I'm sorry, brother.
-Hey, listen.

45:39.611 --> 45:40.654
Make it count.

45:41.447 --> 45:42.614
Make it count.

46:10.142 --> 46:12.269
All right.
Kids, everybody get out of here.

46:12.352 --> 46:13.687
Run! Now!

46:38.253 --> 46:39.379
Guys!

46:40.380 --> 46:43.801
Ronnie, Marge! Can anyone hear me?

46:58.524 --> 47:01.443
Too bad. So sad.

47:01.527 --> 47:05.572
You couldn't save ol' Matty-boy.

47:06.281 --> 47:09.159
Tasty, tasty Matty-boy.

47:10.911 --> 47:14.998
You convinced everyone to come and see me.

47:17.793 --> 47:20.546
'Cause you're such a good friend.

47:21.588 --> 47:25.300
But such a bad daughter!

48:50.510 --> 48:51.595
Don't turn around.

48:52.638 --> 48:54.056
Don't say anything.

48:56.892 --> 48:59.269
Turn on the car and let's drive.

49:54.449 --> 49:56.076
I saw the news. I was so worried.

49:56.535 --> 49:58.662
Something attacked the bus.

49:58.745 --> 49:59.746
-Attacked?
-Yeah.

49:59.830 --> 50:01.415
It just happened so fast.

50:01.498 --> 50:03.625
I don't know what it was.

50:03.709 --> 50:05.210
They've put checkpoints on the state road

50:05.293 --> 50:06.545
going in and out of town.

50:06.586 --> 50:08.296
All right.
We have to find someplace for you to go.

50:08.380 --> 50:09.381
Okay. Okay.

50:09.506 --> 50:11.258
-Come home with me.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

50:11.341 --> 50:13.760
It's too risky. It's-- It ain't safe.

50:13.844 --> 50:16.138
You can't stay outdoors.
They're combing the woods.

50:18.432 --> 50:20.475
Shit. Shit.

50:21.977 --> 50:25.397
Fuck. Fuck. Shit.

50:31.778 --> 50:33.155
Yeah. Okay.

50:36.408 --> 50:38.035
There might be someone who can help.

50:54.051 --> 50:55.177
Hi.

50:55.260 --> 50:56.344
I'm Mrs. Hanlon.

50:56.428 --> 50:58.388
You called about a visitor?

50:58.472 --> 50:59.806
Mrs. Hanlon?

51:01.558 --> 51:03.101
My name is Ingrid Kersh.

51:03.977 --> 51:07.397
You don't know me,
but we have a mutual friend.

51:08.732 --> 51:10.817
And he got hit.

51:11.651 --> 51:12.694
Next thing I know,

51:14.112 --> 51:16.823
he's down, and he's bleeding out.

51:18.784 --> 51:20.243
And so, I get him up.

51:21.411 --> 51:22.579
I take him with me.

51:28.543 --> 51:29.878
It was too late.

51:32.631 --> 51:33.757
Thank you, Major.

51:34.341 --> 51:36.134
If we need any more, we'll let you know.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.442
I am so sorry, Major.

51:54.861 --> 51:56.279
Russo was a good man.

51:58.907 --> 52:00.617
Yes, he was, sir. Thank you.

52:03.620 --> 52:04.704
I want you to know...

52:05.997 --> 52:07.916
these people, they will answer...

52:08.792 --> 52:10.460
for what they led us into.

52:13.296 --> 52:14.506
That being said,

52:15.549 --> 52:17.467
I do still have a few questions of my own.

52:17.551 --> 52:18.718
Sir, I'm sorry.

52:23.473 --> 52:26.017
I would just really like
to go be with my family.

52:27.727 --> 52:28.728
Of course.

52:35.318 --> 52:36.611
General. General.

52:38.738 --> 52:39.739
Hallorann.

52:41.199 --> 52:42.450
Did he make it out?

52:43.994 --> 52:45.662
Hasn't reported back to base.

52:48.498 --> 52:50.625
How he'd have made it
out of there, I don't know.

52:52.335 --> 52:53.962
But if anyone could find a way,

52:55.755 --> 52:57.090
it's Dick Hallorann.
