HEROES NEXT DOOR

THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:44.107
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:45.067

SEONBONG TRADING

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.619
Didn't I tell you to get rid of them all?

00:00:55.702 --> 00:00:58.205
You plan to keep up with this shit job?

00:00:58.288 --> 00:01:02.125
You little shit.

00:01:02.918 --> 00:01:05.170
What should I do with you?

00:01:05.253 --> 00:01:07.214
You absolute moron.

00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:08.882
Stand straight.

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.051
Apologies, sir. I'll take care of it.

00:01:11.134 --> 00:01:13.345
Take care of what? Huh?

00:01:14.554 --> 00:01:16.932
You couldn't even keep the guy
you kidnapped.

00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:25.148
Hey.

00:01:27.192 --> 00:01:29.444
They seem to be connected to Kim In-seop.

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:31.697
Get your guys to look into them.

00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:38.161
You think I'm doing this
just for myself, you morons?

00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:40.831
I'm the only one looking after you
after your discharge.

00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:43.583
You idiots.

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:48.297
You're not listening, are you?

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.298
Sir.

00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:52.426
This is the guy who took Kim In-seop.

00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:09.693
HEROES NEXT DOOR PART 1

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.572
They're my neighbors
who helped me get Producer Kim back.

00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:16.658
She's the head of the Women's Association
in Changri-dong.

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.869
This is the youth association president.

00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:20.746
Yes, I'm the youth association president--

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.664
Now's not the time for introductions.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.587
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes?

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:30.005
What is this place?

00:02:30.422 --> 00:02:31.798
It's my first time here too, so...

00:02:32.174 --> 00:02:34.092
I'm Lee Geun-cheol,
the Vice Minister of National Defense.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.345
And this is Major Lee Su-jin.

00:02:39.348 --> 00:02:43.352
So this is a safe house?

00:02:43.727 --> 00:02:45.729
We thought it'd be best
for Mr. Kim to stay here

00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:49.483
since he's involved
in a Ministry of National Defense case.

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:53.862
No wonder the gas prices
were way too high at this station.

00:02:54.237 --> 00:02:56.615
So that was on purpose.

00:02:56.698 --> 00:02:59.576
To keep others from coming here. Right?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.788
Mr. Lee, does every neighborhood
have one of these?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.374
That's confidential. Let's sit.

00:03:05.874 --> 00:03:06.750
Okay.

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:08.502
- Oh, gosh.
- This is so cool.

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:10.253
What are you doing?

00:03:18.178 --> 00:03:22.015
So the bombs that the military snuck away
went off in our neighborhood?

00:03:24.893 --> 00:03:25.727
Yes.

00:03:27.104 --> 00:03:30.315
So that's why soldiers were there
to clean up the site.

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:31.650
To get rid of the evidence.

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:34.278
Is it even possible for the military
to sneak away bombs?

00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.530
Even a missing shell casing
is a huge deal.

00:03:36.613 --> 00:03:39.866
It could be possible
precisely because it's the military.

00:03:40.284 --> 00:03:41.785
Who snuck away the bombs?

00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:43.537
We're looking into that right now.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.706
Seeing as you've brought Producer Kim
all the way here,

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.166
I guess some big names are involved.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.335
Big names?

00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:53.547
Maybe the President
or the Minister of National Defense?

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.424
That's nonsense.

00:03:55.507 --> 00:03:57.509
That's how it always is in movies.

00:03:57.592 --> 00:04:00.387
Why would the President or the Minister
come here, of all places?

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.847
What if I'm right?

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.642
If you are, you can take your favorite toy
from my stationery store.

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:07.227
Are you here to chit-chat?

00:04:07.853 --> 00:04:10.689
- No, I just--
- "Toys," are you serious?

00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:12.566
I got scolded because of you.

00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:18.071
This is pretty cool.

00:04:21.074 --> 00:04:22.826
By the way, Mr. Choi.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.286
Yes?

00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:26.622
How do you know
the Vice Minister of National Defense?

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.082
Maybe he's a secret agent or something.

00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:34.171
Oh, well...

00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:38.300
Hold on.

00:04:39.301 --> 00:04:40.469
It's General Hwang!

00:04:40.552 --> 00:04:41.720
Who's General Hwang?

00:04:41.803 --> 00:04:43.555
- It's his wife.
- Yeah.

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.973
I'd better get going right now,

00:04:45.057 --> 00:04:47.225
so let's talk about the details
tomorrow at the bunker.

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:49.102
- Okay, goodnight.
- Bye.

00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:50.437
- Bye.
- Goodnight.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.855
Hey, I'm on my way.

00:04:52.564 --> 00:04:54.650
I'm right in front of the house. Okay.

00:04:54.983 --> 00:04:56.401
Goodnight!

00:05:01.198 --> 00:05:04.034
We'd better head home too.

00:05:04.117 --> 00:05:05.827
Tell me everything you know.

00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:07.871
Do you know about the JDD?

00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:08.997
What?

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:11.124
Just spill it.

00:05:13.043 --> 00:05:15.504
This is supposed to be a secret, but...

00:05:30.394 --> 00:05:32.896
You've been acting weird
since moving here.

00:05:34.314 --> 00:05:36.316
Me? No way.

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:39.194
You used to come straight home after work
before moving here.

00:05:39.403 --> 00:05:42.447
Since when did you start
doing a lap around town every evening?

00:05:42.698 --> 00:05:44.950
The youth association president--

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:46.618
Come up with a new excuse, at least.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.328
It's always the same story.

00:05:48.578 --> 00:05:49.997
Try a little harder.

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:53.333
Wash up and go to bed.

00:05:54.543 --> 00:05:55.419
Yes, ma'am.

00:06:08.974 --> 00:06:10.100
Hey!

00:06:12.602 --> 00:06:14.896
Were you scolded by your wife?

00:06:15.272 --> 00:06:17.107
It was fine.

00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:19.109
Really?

00:06:20.402 --> 00:06:22.779
You know that button camera
you gave me yesterday?

00:06:23.363 --> 00:06:25.240
My legendary masterpiece that you lost?

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:26.908
I didn't lose it.

00:06:26.992 --> 00:06:28.619
I planted it on one of the kidnappers.

00:06:35.917 --> 00:06:37.711
Can you track its last location?

00:06:38.462 --> 00:06:41.632
It might've captured some important clues

00:06:41.715 --> 00:06:43.342
that point to who's behind it, you know?

00:06:45.385 --> 00:06:46.678
Man...

00:06:46.762 --> 00:06:48.096
It was turned off last night.

00:06:49.056 --> 00:06:50.098
Did it run out of battery?

00:06:50.182 --> 00:06:51.558
No, it's supposed to last a month.

00:06:54.227 --> 00:06:55.729
But I can see where it turned off.

00:06:56.188 --> 00:06:57.314
Yeah? Where is it?

00:06:58.315 --> 00:07:00.525
Why? Are you going alone again?

00:07:00.817 --> 00:07:01.777
Of course I am.

00:07:05.572 --> 00:07:06.823
Only I know the location.

00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:10.410
- Give it to me.
- Hey, stop it.

00:07:10.494 --> 00:07:11.536
- Cut it out.
- You can't come!

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.830
- Just give it to me!
- Let me go with you, then.

00:07:16.917 --> 00:07:18.710
What are you guys doing
so early in the morning?

00:07:19.586 --> 00:07:21.296
Oh, nothing.

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:24.633
I'm just teaching Byeong-nam how to sweep.

00:07:24.716 --> 00:07:26.218
He was doing such a terrible job.

00:07:29.262 --> 00:07:30.347
See you at lunch.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.431
Fine by me.

00:07:33.892 --> 00:07:35.519
I have to go to work now. Bye.

00:07:35.602 --> 00:07:36.687
All right.

00:07:37.396 --> 00:07:39.147
Why are you meeting at lunch?

00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:40.524
What are you doing without me?

00:07:40.607 --> 00:07:41.608
Let me join you too.

00:07:41.692 --> 00:07:44.403
Join us on what? It's nothing.

00:07:44.486 --> 00:07:47.364
Even last night, you guys left me out...

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.659
Hey, Nam-yeon.

00:07:51.994 --> 00:07:53.704
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

00:07:53.787 --> 00:07:55.122
No, not you.

00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:56.665
I'm on my way now.

00:07:56.748 --> 00:07:59.042
I'll be right over, honey.

00:08:01.253 --> 00:08:02.087
Okay.

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:09.594
Sorry, I'm late.

00:08:10.095 --> 00:08:11.138
So what's up?

00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:12.681
SAFE GAS STATION

00:08:12.764 --> 00:08:16.018
Another order from Safe Gas Station?

00:08:16.977 --> 00:08:20.063
The same gas station
where you went with my buddies last night.

00:08:23.483 --> 00:08:25.402
Are you really not going to tell me?

00:08:26.236 --> 00:08:27.154
About what?

00:08:27.237 --> 00:08:31.116
Why were you at the gas station
with Yong-hui, Byeong-nam, and the tutor?

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.745
Stop asking.

00:08:34.828 --> 00:08:36.079
If you ask one more time...

00:08:38.373 --> 00:08:39.416
Delivery!

00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:41.209
Okay, thank you.

00:08:42.336 --> 00:08:43.920
Those must be the Changri Market flyers.

00:08:44.004 --> 00:08:45.422
Hand them out on your deliveries.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.966
Can't a man ask a question?

00:08:55.098 --> 00:08:58.352
They usually hire people from other fields
as insurance fraud investigators.

00:08:59.144 --> 00:09:03.190
Like detectives, lawyers, or nurses.
People who can easily spot fraud.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.150
But this guy, Choi Kang,

00:09:05.776 --> 00:09:08.153
quit college halfway,
was exempt from conscription,

00:09:08.236 --> 00:09:11.823
and was jobless before getting hired
without even a proper major?

00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:14.409
Do you see what I mean?

00:09:17.955 --> 00:09:21.583
And Veotigo Insurance,
where Choi Kang works,

00:09:21.667 --> 00:09:23.377
is funded by the government.

00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:26.505
Like a government grant
for private companies?

00:09:26.588 --> 00:09:27.547
No.

00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:30.384
It's a defense R&D grant
from the Ministry of National Defense,

00:09:30.467 --> 00:09:31.718
issued by Foreign Affairs.

00:09:31.802 --> 00:09:36.014
Why would Foreign Affairs
fund a grant from National Defense?

00:09:36.098 --> 00:09:40.060
It's not unheard of,
but it's not common, either.

00:09:40.143 --> 00:09:41.144
Since when?

00:09:41.728 --> 00:09:44.731
Since he started working here?

00:09:44.815 --> 00:09:45.816
Yes.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.236
And on top of that,
the grant doesn't have an end date.

00:09:49.319 --> 00:09:51.196
Hold on.

00:09:52.864 --> 00:09:55.367
A while ago,

00:09:55.993 --> 00:10:00.289
I heard about a military unit
that Foreign Affairs only station abroad.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.792
So he wasn't part of
the Ministry of National Defense?

00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:06.128
Hey, make sure to look into this.

00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:07.421
Yes, sir.

00:10:12.009 --> 00:10:13.760
Any updates on the bombs in Kiyun-si?

00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:17.681
It took real effort to smuggle them out,
so why are they back in Korea?

00:10:17.764 --> 00:10:21.018
Someone paid double the price abroad
to purchase the bombs,

00:10:21.101 --> 00:10:23.979
but the brokers lost contact,
so they want us to wait.

00:10:24.062 --> 00:10:25.897
Well, we can't wait forever.

00:10:26.231 --> 00:10:27.316
Another thing.

00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:28.859
I've been hearing rumors

00:10:30.027 --> 00:10:32.613
that the Vice Minister
is looking into the bombs.

00:10:33.155 --> 00:10:34.448
The Vice Minister?

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.699
Yes.

00:10:46.585 --> 00:10:47.669
Hello.

00:10:52.549 --> 00:10:53.800
So you've been busy lately.

00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:55.177
Sorry?

00:10:58.138 --> 00:11:01.350
I hear you've been nosing around
here and there.

00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:11.109
Actually, I had something
to report to you.

00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:15.113
Report? About what?

00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:22.746
The bombs that were
part of our military supplies

00:11:23.497 --> 00:11:25.123
went off in a civilian area.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.211
It looks like there's corruption
in our ministry.

00:11:30.712 --> 00:11:32.714
Is that so?

00:11:35.342 --> 00:11:39.805
Would you have anything
to say about this, sir?

00:11:43.308 --> 00:11:44.309
Huh?

00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:57.489
NA EUN-JAE

00:12:01.827 --> 00:12:04.705
You snuck away arms and used the money
to invest in Changri-dong,

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.292
and those weapons have returned
and are giving you a nightmare.

00:12:08.375 --> 00:12:10.085
That's not what's important.

00:12:11.878 --> 00:12:14.214
The Vice Minister seems to know something.

00:12:21.096 --> 00:12:24.975
Remember how confident you were
when you screamed at me?

00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:27.477
That you'd take care of everything?

00:12:27.561 --> 00:12:29.438
Who said I wouldn't?

00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:32.691
You know everything now, anyway.

00:12:32.774 --> 00:12:36.445
I'm just saying
we should help each other when in need.

00:12:36.528 --> 00:12:37.362
"Each other"?

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.740
Come on.

00:12:39.823 --> 00:12:41.825
Why do you have to be so uptight?

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:43.785
If this goes wrong,

00:12:44.369 --> 00:12:46.455
it's over for all of us.

00:12:47.706 --> 00:12:48.915
You know this.

00:12:59.343 --> 00:13:01.011
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER, KWON SANG-TAE

00:13:04.765 --> 00:13:06.141
Hi, Mr. Kwon.

00:13:06.224 --> 00:13:07.476
It's me, Eun-jae.

00:13:09.728 --> 00:13:11.104
Why don't we catch up over dinner?

00:13:17.194 --> 00:13:19.571
Go straight this way.

00:13:19.655 --> 00:13:20.489
Okay.

00:13:24.368 --> 00:13:26.536
About your no-comment stuff.

00:13:27.704 --> 00:13:30.666
I told Nam-yeon everything.

00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:32.834
Oh, come on.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.129
You can't keep a secret, can you?

00:13:36.213 --> 00:13:37.965
She was ready to kill me.

00:13:38.048 --> 00:13:40.008
And she saw everything,
so I had no choice.

00:13:47.683 --> 00:13:51.144
Anyway, I have a question.

00:13:51.228 --> 00:13:52.396
That'll be 500 won.

00:13:52.771 --> 00:13:53.605
Why, you...

00:13:54.648 --> 00:13:56.650
- Give me a discount.
- Fine, 300 won.

00:13:59.236 --> 00:14:02.406
Why did you join JDD?

00:14:02.489 --> 00:14:03.657
To make money.

00:14:09.037 --> 00:14:11.039
- That's all?
- That'll be extra 200 won.

00:14:11.123 --> 00:14:12.291
Hey!

00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.252
You're kidding me. Forget it.

00:14:16.169 --> 00:14:17.587
Seriously!

00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:28.265
SEOON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX

00:14:51.371 --> 00:14:53.248
Did those things block off the GPS signal?

00:14:53.665 --> 00:14:55.375
They look like regular transceivers to me.

00:14:55.834 --> 00:14:57.586
I used a cheap GPS chip.

00:14:57.669 --> 00:14:59.046
It must have overloaded.

00:15:01.715 --> 00:15:04.801
How can we find that tiny button
in such a big area?

00:15:05.552 --> 00:15:08.138
The GPS may be off,
but the recording function should be fine.

00:15:09.473 --> 00:15:10.515
What if it turned off too?

00:15:12.017 --> 00:15:13.769
It would've recorded everything
until then.

00:15:17.731 --> 00:15:20.943
Back in the day,
we used to smack appliances to fix them.

00:15:21.026 --> 00:15:24.780
And if that didn't work,
we just restarted it.

00:15:24.863 --> 00:15:26.406
But everything is digital now...

00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:29.117
- That's it!
- What?

00:15:29.701 --> 00:15:30.661
Hey!

00:15:31.328 --> 00:15:33.997
We just have to restart it!

00:15:34.247 --> 00:15:35.832
What? Did I just solve everything?

00:15:37.292 --> 00:15:41.004
If it's still recording,
it means the device is fine.

00:15:42.047 --> 00:15:44.633
All we need to do
is reset the GPS signal, then.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.347
Who are you talking to? You're scaring me.

00:15:50.597 --> 00:15:53.058
Hey, I know how we can find the camera.

00:15:53.141 --> 00:15:54.017
Follow me.

00:15:54.643 --> 00:15:55.936
You thought of a way?

00:15:56.603 --> 00:15:58.271
- What is it?
- Just follow me.

00:15:58.355 --> 00:16:00.190
- Is it something quick?
- Yeah.

00:16:02.567 --> 00:16:04.778
I wonder what it filmed.

00:16:04.861 --> 00:16:09.116
Perhaps their hideout
or the person behind it all?

00:16:10.075 --> 00:16:12.035
It'll be game over if we stream this.

00:16:12.744 --> 00:16:14.329
Aren't you scared?

00:16:15.706 --> 00:16:16.999
Of course I am.

00:16:17.666 --> 00:16:19.209
But if I hide because I'm afraid,

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.253
they'll just keep doing it.

00:16:21.753 --> 00:16:22.754
Right.

00:16:28.844 --> 00:16:31.096
You said the GPS was turned off.
How will you retrieve it?

00:16:31.388 --> 00:16:35.517
I'm going to make a simple equipment
and restart it.

00:16:35.726 --> 00:16:37.144
Byeong-nam.

00:16:37.227 --> 00:16:39.730
Are you going to send a signal
to clear the tracker's error?

00:16:39.813 --> 00:16:42.983
You really are smart, aren't you?

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.068
Get on it, then.

00:16:45.152 --> 00:16:46.445
I'm on it.

00:16:47.404 --> 00:16:48.614
There's another problem.

00:16:50.324 --> 00:16:52.618
The industrial complex is quite big.

00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:09.176
Then,

00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:12.929
why don't we try using RC cars or drones?

00:17:13.597 --> 00:17:16.016
We can set up the reset system on it
and look for the button.

00:17:16.683 --> 00:17:18.727
That'll definitely be faster than just us.

00:17:19.561 --> 00:17:23.023
There are too many electric wires,
so an RC car would work better.

00:17:23.398 --> 00:17:24.608
But here's the thing.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:29.529
A decent RC car would be quite expensive.

00:17:33.825 --> 00:17:35.994
I have two at home.

00:17:39.122 --> 00:17:42.125
I'll try to get one myself.

00:17:42.209 --> 00:17:43.418
Let's work with three.

00:17:44.002 --> 00:17:46.088
Then get some practice on your own,

00:17:46.171 --> 00:17:47.255
and let's wrap up for today.

00:17:48.548 --> 00:17:50.425
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah!

00:17:50.509 --> 00:17:52.552
- Let's go.
- Good work, everyone.

00:17:52.636 --> 00:17:53.804
All right.

00:18:03.105 --> 00:18:04.147
Yes?

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.694
May I bring a laptop?

00:18:09.528 --> 00:18:13.198
Since all signals
seem to be completely blocked here.

00:18:20.664 --> 00:18:21.623
Sure.

00:18:23.792 --> 00:18:24.876
Thank you.

00:18:30.507 --> 00:18:33.760
SAFE GAS STATION

00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:53.697
We've got three RC car units on standby.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.034
Once the target position is identified,
we'll deploy an infiltration squad.

00:18:58.493 --> 00:19:01.788
The remaining units will stay on standby
and act as Rapid Response Units as needed.

00:19:01.872 --> 00:19:04.541
Wow, look at you, Mr. Lee.

00:19:05.584 --> 00:19:06.710
Roger that.

00:19:06.793 --> 00:19:07.711
Yes, sir.

00:19:13.759 --> 00:19:15.636
- Is that it?
- Yes.

00:19:18.263 --> 00:19:19.890
It's the laptop I mentioned.

00:19:19.973 --> 00:19:22.017
Where should I put it, ma'am?

00:19:24.144 --> 00:19:25.854
- Give it here.
- Okay.

00:19:26.939 --> 00:19:29.107
Su-jin, the report you just made...

00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:30.400
It's a situational report.

00:19:30.484 --> 00:19:31.443
Right,

00:19:31.526 --> 00:19:34.112
I guess the situation
hasn't been good lately.

00:19:35.656 --> 00:19:36.490
So?

00:19:37.074 --> 00:19:39.785
So... The situation...

00:19:40.577 --> 00:19:41.870
I think it's great.

00:19:41.954 --> 00:19:44.206
You're really good
at making those reports.

00:19:50.253 --> 00:19:52.089
I have good news and bad news.

00:19:52.172 --> 00:19:53.840
I'll take the good news first.

00:19:55.008 --> 00:19:57.052
We'll be providing equipment
for this operation.

00:19:59.513 --> 00:20:00.764
What's the bad news?

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.981
If you come dressed like that again,

00:20:10.565 --> 00:20:11.900
I'll kill you.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.194
Okay.

00:20:21.994 --> 00:20:23.662
Why would you ask about the bad news?

00:20:24.454 --> 00:20:25.664
I can't believe you.

00:20:31.169 --> 00:20:32.629
Hello!

00:20:33.046 --> 00:20:34.506
Hello.

00:20:34.589 --> 00:20:35.757
I'm here to pick up some clothes.

00:20:35.841 --> 00:20:37.843
I was wondering why you weren't coming.

00:20:38.302 --> 00:20:41.346
You're here to pick up
the jacket that Kang brought, right?

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.932
Yes, do you remember
every piece of clothing you get?

00:20:44.016 --> 00:20:47.394
Of course, I've had this job for decades.

00:20:47.769 --> 00:20:49.104
All right.

00:20:50.606 --> 00:20:52.733
That'll be 10,000 won.

00:20:52.816 --> 00:20:55.569
Do-yeon, you get prettier
every time I see you.

00:20:55.652 --> 00:20:56.903
Thank you.

00:20:58.071 --> 00:20:59.364
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:20:59.448 --> 00:21:01.283
Are you done unpacking all the boxes now?

00:21:02.326 --> 00:21:07.289
Kang said that there were so many
that some hadn't even been opened.

00:21:07.372 --> 00:21:09.583
He told you that?

00:21:09.666 --> 00:21:12.544
I also know how scary you are.

00:21:13.337 --> 00:21:14.796
Me?

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.798
Why would he say something so unnecessary?

00:21:16.882 --> 00:21:19.926
I also heard many of those boxes
were Do-yeon's stuff.

00:21:20.385 --> 00:21:22.179
That's the case
for every family with kids.

00:21:22.262 --> 00:21:23.597
Oh, right.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.058
If Do-yeon has any clothes she's outgrown

00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:27.934
or toys she no longer plays with,

00:21:28.018 --> 00:21:29.895
sell them at the Changri Market.

00:21:29.978 --> 00:21:31.021
Changri Market?

00:21:31.104 --> 00:21:32.898
Oh, you don't know about it yet.

00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:35.817
It's run by the Women's Association.

00:21:35.901 --> 00:21:39.446
You can trade items and share some snacks.

00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:41.990
It's a good way
to get to know your neighbors too.

00:21:42.783 --> 00:21:45.077
- And Do-yeon would make some friends.
- Yes.

00:21:47.245 --> 00:21:49.456
- Thank you.
- Okay, goodbye.

00:21:49.539 --> 00:21:51.959
- Goodbye.
- Okay, bye.

00:22:07.599 --> 00:22:10.936
CHANGRI MARKET

00:22:16.775 --> 00:22:18.193
Oh, it's Mr. Kim.

00:22:19.069 --> 00:22:20.570
Hello, Mr. Kim.

00:22:20.654 --> 00:22:21.947
Hi, Do-yeon!

00:22:22.739 --> 00:22:24.199
- Hi.
- Do-yeon.

00:22:25.993 --> 00:22:26.952
Hello.

00:22:27.035 --> 00:22:30.956
Since I'm close with Kang,
may I call you by your name?

00:22:31.707 --> 00:22:34.042
Oh, you're the owner, right?

00:22:34.126 --> 00:22:35.669
Yes, I'm the owner,

00:22:35.752 --> 00:22:37.838
and my wife is the boss.

00:22:39.381 --> 00:22:41.341
You must be making kimchi stew
with curry powder.

00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:43.969
How did you know?

00:22:44.052 --> 00:22:46.013
Kang wouldn't stop bragging about it.

00:22:46.096 --> 00:22:48.015
He said you had a secret recipe.

00:22:48.515 --> 00:22:50.058
He really shares everything, huh?

00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:51.727
We just talk about life, you know.

00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:53.395
- Take your time.
- Okay.

00:22:53.478 --> 00:22:55.397
- Ask Mommy to get you some snacks.
- Okay.

00:22:55.981 --> 00:22:56.940
Let's go.

00:22:59.443 --> 00:23:01.570
- Hi, Do-yeon.
- Hi, Min-seo.

00:23:07.659 --> 00:23:08.785
There we go.

00:23:10.912 --> 00:23:12.998
What are you doing tomorrow?

00:23:13.749 --> 00:23:16.710
If you're not busy,
I'd love to invite you to this.

00:23:16.793 --> 00:23:19.379
Oh, the Changri Market?

00:23:19.713 --> 00:23:21.632
The laundry place owner told me about it.

00:23:22.507 --> 00:23:24.593
As expected
from the head of our neighborhood.

00:23:25.427 --> 00:23:26.887
Come with Do-yeon if you're not busy.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.221
Will Min-seo be there too?

00:23:28.847 --> 00:23:31.391
She'll probably come by
after her tutoring session.

00:23:31.475 --> 00:23:33.518
The pancakes there are the best.

00:23:33.602 --> 00:23:34.853
- Pancakes?
- Yes.

00:23:34.936 --> 00:23:36.480
Mom, I want to go.

00:23:36.563 --> 00:23:37.522
Let's go!

00:23:37.814 --> 00:23:39.191
- Should we?
- Yes!

00:23:39.608 --> 00:23:41.068
Yes, pancakes!

00:23:41.151 --> 00:23:42.527
- Pancakes!
- Pancakes!

00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:45.656
CHANGRI MARKET

00:23:47.741 --> 00:23:50.369
When did you become friends
with the daughter of the grocery store?

00:23:51.328 --> 00:23:52.996
You're so popular.

00:23:53.413 --> 00:23:54.748
I'm friends with everyone.

00:23:55.415 --> 00:23:58.043
Dad and Master Lee are also super close.

00:23:58.126 --> 00:23:59.836
They're always whispering to each other.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.047
That's so funny.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:03.215
I know.

00:24:03.298 --> 00:24:04.883
He's so talkative.

00:24:06.927 --> 00:24:08.595
We're almost home.

00:24:11.515 --> 00:24:13.266
It's the car from the laundry place.

00:24:28.031 --> 00:24:29.032
Let's go up.

00:24:29.408 --> 00:24:30.367
Okay.

00:24:42.296 --> 00:24:43.338
Why did you call me?

00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:48.802
Welcome, secret agent.

00:24:56.518 --> 00:24:57.853
How does it look?

00:24:57.936 --> 00:24:58.895
What's that?

00:24:58.979 --> 00:25:01.356
It's 350g in weight and 32cm in length.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.735
Since it's the standard size
for Special Forces worldwide,

00:25:04.818 --> 00:25:05.777
it should be good.

00:25:05.861 --> 00:25:08.864
When this is out,
use it as a tactical baton.

00:25:08.947 --> 00:25:12.242
And when it's folded...

00:25:12.326 --> 00:25:14.077
You've watched that movie, right?

00:25:15.954 --> 00:25:17.247
"What are you saying?"

00:25:17.706 --> 00:25:20.125
Use it as a hatchet or a hammer
and just strike!

00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:22.044
It'll knock out anyone's teeth in seconds.

00:25:24.004 --> 00:25:24.838
Here.

00:25:29.426 --> 00:25:30.594
This is awesome.

00:25:30.677 --> 00:25:31.637
Right?

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.309
It's useful for both
short and long distance combats.

00:25:42.648 --> 00:25:43.482
Hold on.

00:25:43.565 --> 00:25:44.483
Is this...

00:25:48.153 --> 00:25:49.905
Is this also a taser?

00:25:49.988 --> 00:25:51.365
Don't be ridiculous.

00:25:51.448 --> 00:25:53.325
I just took out the magic wand sounds.

00:25:56.828 --> 00:25:57.996
As for how it looks...

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:58.914
Yes?

00:26:00.499 --> 00:26:02.042
- it's a pass.
- Yes!

00:26:03.001 --> 00:26:04.211
Right on!

00:26:04.294 --> 00:26:06.004
What about the GPS transmitter?

00:26:06.088 --> 00:26:07.464
Don't worry about that.

00:26:16.807 --> 00:26:18.642
You attached GPS transmitters to these?

00:26:18.725 --> 00:26:20.477
That's right.

00:26:21.061 --> 00:26:22.562
I went to the industrial complex
for a scan--

00:26:22.646 --> 00:26:24.147
You're so well-prepared!

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.275
And several offices
were closed for the weekend.

00:26:26.358 --> 00:26:28.694
Well, everyone works five days a week.

00:26:28.777 --> 00:26:29.820
Many factories were empty.

00:26:29.903 --> 00:26:31.697
No surprise there. The economy is bad.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.532
Stop yapping and listen.

00:26:35.325 --> 00:26:36.243
Okay.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.997
Let's get everything done tomorrow.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.041
Are we going in immediately
once we find the location?

00:26:44.001 --> 00:26:45.794
Should we go at night, then?

00:26:45.877 --> 00:26:47.963
It'll be easier to operate the RC cars
during the day.

00:26:48.755 --> 00:26:51.550
I can't go anywhere during the day
because of Changri Market tomorrow.

00:26:51.967 --> 00:26:53.510
The recon team can go during the day,

00:26:53.593 --> 00:26:55.429
and the entry team can go at night.

00:26:55.762 --> 00:26:56.930
That should be fine, then.

00:26:57.014 --> 00:26:58.682
Mr. Choi, you can go in first.

00:26:58.765 --> 00:27:00.142
I'll support you from the back.

00:27:00.225 --> 00:27:01.393
Okay.

00:27:01.476 --> 00:27:03.854
How do we work these transmitters?

00:27:03.937 --> 00:27:05.439
It's simple.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.275
Turn it on before you drive it,

00:27:08.358 --> 00:27:10.277
and the GPS tracker
will receive the signal and reset.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.362
Then I'll see its location
on my phone again.

00:27:12.446 --> 00:27:13.864
I'll go in to retrieve it.

00:27:14.615 --> 00:27:16.742
- And Ms. Jung will back me up.
- Okay.

00:27:19.536 --> 00:27:21.872
We can communicate with you
from here with these.

00:27:23.123 --> 00:27:25.375
- How?
- It's connected to the bunker computer.

00:27:26.668 --> 00:27:29.046
This is a wiretap device.

00:27:30.255 --> 00:27:31.465
That's awesome.

00:27:31.548 --> 00:27:32.633
- Let's try them.
- Okay.

00:27:36.845 --> 00:27:37.929
Thank you.

00:27:43.602 --> 00:27:48.190
We can expedite it by assigning it
as a special disaster zone.

00:27:48.273 --> 00:27:51.777
There would be a good reason,
so we can provide some solid support

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.946
through government aid or tax benefits.

00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:55.948
That's an option,

00:27:56.031 --> 00:27:58.867
but there needs to be an actual disaster.

00:28:02.329 --> 00:28:05.874
Terrorism is a disaster to our society.

00:28:05.958 --> 00:28:08.877
It threatens national security
and social order.

00:28:10.087 --> 00:28:14.549
My local residents
are going crazy with paranoia.

00:28:15.217 --> 00:28:16.468
Cut them some slack.

00:28:16.718 --> 00:28:19.012
It's about the scale of the damage.

00:28:19.888 --> 00:28:22.432
The damage isn't big enough
to count as a disaster.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:28.689
I trust your son is doing well
and not causing any trouble.

00:28:32.776 --> 00:28:34.569
Of course, he's very well.

00:28:35.654 --> 00:28:39.199
I forgot to bring him to thank you.

00:28:41.535 --> 00:28:43.036
Thank me?

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.373
There's no need for that.

00:28:48.041 --> 00:28:51.003
Please just back me up
on the disaster zone.

00:28:51.878 --> 00:28:55.048
Your son really is unlucky.

00:28:55.132 --> 00:28:57.467
He just had to hit
Sullivan's daughter, of all people.

00:29:02.264 --> 00:29:04.057
It's hard for us too, you know.

00:29:04.641 --> 00:29:07.311
Sullivan's about to pull out
after the final verdict.

00:29:08.228 --> 00:29:11.440
It's been absolute chaos.

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:19.072
I'm out now.

00:29:19.156 --> 00:29:20.157
Bring the car.

00:29:40.886 --> 00:29:41.762
Are you...

00:30:48.078 --> 00:30:49.037
Honey?

00:30:53.041 --> 00:30:53.959
Are we moving again?

00:30:55.752 --> 00:30:57.713
These are for Changri Market tomorrow.

00:30:58.714 --> 00:31:01.174
Oh, Changri Market.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:03.802
The Women's Association is hosting it.
I hear it's a lot of fun.

00:31:03.885 --> 00:31:05.053
Yeah, I heard.

00:31:05.345 --> 00:31:06.680
Let's go tomorrow.

00:31:06.763 --> 00:31:09.016
It's been a while since we've eaten out.

00:31:09.099 --> 00:31:10.976
I have plans tomorrow evening.

00:31:11.977 --> 00:31:14.062
You're going out with the youth president
on a weekend?

00:31:14.313 --> 00:31:15.355
No, that's not it--

00:31:15.439 --> 00:31:16.273
Okay, then.

00:31:18.442 --> 00:31:22.487
Introduce me to the people
you're close to tomorrow.

00:31:22.988 --> 00:31:25.991
The neighborhood leaders seem great.

00:31:26.074 --> 00:31:27.200
They adore Do-yeon too.

00:31:27.701 --> 00:31:29.620
I'd like to get to know them as well.

00:31:30.287 --> 00:31:32.706
I'm not meeting
the youth president tomorrow--

00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:34.124
Cancel whatever it is.

00:31:35.042 --> 00:31:36.418
I'm not saying it again.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.919
Okay.

00:31:41.048 --> 00:31:42.090
Leave it.

00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:44.051
Just go and get changed.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.639
Get in.

00:32:31.181 --> 00:32:32.975
Wow, this is a new car.

00:32:33.058 --> 00:32:33.934
It's my backup car.

00:32:34.768 --> 00:32:37.145
Man, this is sick.

00:32:41.233 --> 00:32:42.693
- Let's go.
- All right.

00:32:42.776 --> 00:32:43.694
Yes.

00:33:04.006 --> 00:33:06.300
Let's see. Here.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.012
- I'll park the car and join you.
- Okay.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:11.471
Let's go.

00:33:11.555 --> 00:33:12.723
- See you soon.
- Okay.

00:33:17.644 --> 00:33:21.857
BUY, SELL, AND SHARE AT CHANGRI MARKET

00:33:24.067 --> 00:33:25.611
Don't run, Do-yeon.

00:33:25.694 --> 00:33:26.695
Okay!

00:33:27.988 --> 00:33:29.114
Hi, Ms. Hwang.

00:33:29.197 --> 00:33:30.991
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:33:31.325 --> 00:33:33.243
Where should I put the donation items?

00:33:33.327 --> 00:33:35.037
Could you take it for her?

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.122
Come and have some dried persimmons first.

00:33:37.205 --> 00:33:38.165
They're amazing.

00:33:40.334 --> 00:33:41.209
Let's have a taste.

00:33:41.293 --> 00:33:42.878
Here. Have some.

00:33:42.961 --> 00:33:44.296
- They look so good.
- They look great.

00:33:50.844 --> 00:33:51.970
It's so good.

00:33:52.054 --> 00:33:53.472
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

00:33:54.348 --> 00:33:55.265
It's amazing.

00:33:55.349 --> 00:33:57.309
Oh, they're from Sangju.

00:33:57.684 --> 00:33:59.478
Sangju has the best dried persimmons.

00:33:59.561 --> 00:34:01.229
I'm originally from Sangju.

00:34:01.313 --> 00:34:02.814
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:34:03.231 --> 00:34:05.192
You must've had a lot of these, Ms. Hwang.

00:34:05.275 --> 00:34:08.070
Please call me Mi-gyeong.

00:34:08.612 --> 00:34:10.447
Should I, Mi-gyeong?

00:34:11.156 --> 00:34:12.950
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

00:34:13.033 --> 00:34:14.159
- Try it. It's so good.
- Is it?

00:34:14.242 --> 00:34:15.285
It's amazing.

00:34:18.747 --> 00:34:21.625
By the way,
who's the youth association president?

00:34:22.417 --> 00:34:25.796
My husband always talks about him,
so I wanted to say hi.

00:34:26.755 --> 00:34:28.924
Oh, the youth association president?

00:34:30.384 --> 00:34:32.177
I guess he's gone somewhere.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.929
I don't see him.

00:34:34.262 --> 00:34:35.347
Where did he go?

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:37.182
Then how about
the manager from Yongmu Gym?

00:34:38.392 --> 00:34:40.143
Oh, my.

00:34:40.727 --> 00:34:42.396
Come to think of it,
he's not here, either.

00:34:42.479 --> 00:34:43.522
You're right.

00:34:43.605 --> 00:34:45.065
Where did they all go?

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.026
Have some more.

00:34:48.443 --> 00:34:49.444
- Isn't it good?
- Yeah.

00:34:49.528 --> 00:34:51.321
- They're amazing.
- For sure.

00:34:51.405 --> 00:34:52.739
- They're so good.
- Have some more.

00:35:01.957 --> 00:35:02.916
Hold up.

00:35:05.502 --> 00:35:06.336
Hey.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.754
How are things looking there?

00:35:07.838 --> 00:35:10.257
It's the perfect weather for a drive.

00:35:11.174 --> 00:35:13.343
Don't worry about us. You just sit tight.

00:35:13.427 --> 00:35:14.261
See you later.

00:35:16.138 --> 00:35:17.139
Did you practice a lot?

00:35:17.222 --> 00:35:18.932
Yeah, I practiced all night.

00:35:19.308 --> 00:35:20.350
Shall we begin?

00:35:21.893 --> 00:35:22.853
Yeah.

00:36:01.308 --> 00:36:02.934
We can't go too fast.

00:36:03.226 --> 00:36:04.936
The signals take some time to transmit.

00:36:06.688 --> 00:36:08.315
How fast should we go, then?

00:36:09.942 --> 00:36:11.151
At an adequate speed?

00:36:53.068 --> 00:36:54.194
Oh, no.

00:36:55.153 --> 00:36:56.029
What's wrong?

00:36:56.113 --> 00:36:58.490
Man! It's not working.

00:37:00.993 --> 00:37:02.160
What are you doing?

00:37:02.244 --> 00:37:03.912
- Just run with it, then!
- Oh, come on!

00:37:03.996 --> 00:37:06.707
You lied about practicing, didn't you?

00:37:07.541 --> 00:37:08.667
Let's see.

00:37:24.433 --> 00:37:25.392
Hey!

00:37:27.894 --> 00:37:29.438
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

00:37:32.232 --> 00:37:34.067
Oh, no. It's completely ruined.

00:37:35.736 --> 00:37:36.737
The transmitter.

00:37:37.279 --> 00:37:38.113
Okay.

00:38:35.462 --> 00:38:36.463
What the...

00:39:11.373 --> 00:39:12.416
Is it here?

00:39:17.087 --> 00:39:18.130
Found it.

00:39:18.797 --> 00:39:19.923
I found it, Byeong-nam.

00:39:21.008 --> 00:39:21.842
You found it?

00:39:22.634 --> 00:39:24.386
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:39:24.469 --> 00:39:26.138
Put the wiretap device on it.

00:39:26.722 --> 00:39:27.681
Okay.

00:39:46.617 --> 00:39:47.951
Where are you?

00:40:10.182 --> 00:40:11.433
Excuse me!

00:40:15.729 --> 00:40:16.688
Me?

00:40:20.859 --> 00:40:23.320
What are you doing with my RC car?

00:40:24.237 --> 00:40:26.114
Oh, is this yours?

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:28.492
What are you doing here?

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:32.245
What else? Practicing my driving skills.

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:35.540
This is the best place to practice
on weekends.

00:40:41.922 --> 00:40:43.090
Take it somewhere else.

00:40:50.597 --> 00:40:53.225
Hey! Retreat!

00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:55.435
Nice one, Byeong-nam.

00:41:00.774 --> 00:41:02.234
- Yong-hui.
- Yeah?

00:41:02.317 --> 00:41:03.694
- Take this.
- Why?

00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:06.530
- You two go ahead.
- What about you?

00:41:06.613 --> 00:41:09.324
I'll stay here until the entry team comes.

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:13.662
- I'll be back soon.
- Okay, see you.

00:41:21.128 --> 00:41:22.337
Wait here, okay?

00:41:22.421 --> 00:41:23.338
Okay.

00:41:26.174 --> 00:41:27.384
It's so good.

00:41:28.093 --> 00:41:29.386
They found the button.

00:41:29.469 --> 00:41:30.512
Yes, I heard.

00:41:30.595 --> 00:41:33.432
My husband will clean up for me,
so let's get going soon.

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:36.101
I'll be a bit late.

00:41:36.977 --> 00:41:38.603
What would you like? This?

00:41:38.687 --> 00:41:40.731
- Your wife?
- Yeah.

00:41:41.189 --> 00:41:43.108
Okay, drive there on your own
if you need to.

00:42:15.515 --> 00:42:17.684
You'll be blocked
if you fail more than twice.

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:21.104
Come on, Su-jin.
I served in the 900th Unit.

00:42:47.214 --> 00:42:48.715
- Amazing.
- It's nothing.

00:42:50.133 --> 00:42:51.218
Okay.

00:43:02.229 --> 00:43:03.188
Okay.

00:43:05.941 --> 00:43:07.442
You see that there? It's on.

00:43:12.906 --> 00:43:14.700
The soccer match is today, right?

00:43:14.783 --> 00:43:16.326
Yes, it's at 8 p.m.

00:43:16.576 --> 00:43:18.954
It's going to be an exciting match.

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:21.957
Order some beer and snacks for later.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:22.958
Yes, sir.

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:27.045
Nice. We can hear them loud and clear.

00:43:36.888 --> 00:43:37.889
Can you hear me?

00:43:39.266 --> 00:43:40.267
Yes, I can.

00:43:41.476 --> 00:43:43.020
When is the entry team coming?

00:43:45.981 --> 00:43:47.316
I just arrived at the market.

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:50.068
Yes, I'll head on over with them.

00:43:56.783 --> 00:43:57.701
- See you.
- Okay.

00:43:57.784 --> 00:43:58.785
See you later.

00:44:20.307 --> 00:44:22.643
We're almost there.
See you at the entrance.

00:44:33.946 --> 00:44:35.197
- Byeong-nam.
- Hey.

00:44:35.781 --> 00:44:37.783
Where's Kang?

00:44:38.033 --> 00:44:40.035
He'll be a bit late.

00:44:40.118 --> 00:44:42.329
They're having beer while watching soccer.

00:44:42.412 --> 00:44:43.747
Should we wait until they pass out?

00:44:49.378 --> 00:44:51.380
No, we have to go in.

00:44:51.463 --> 00:44:53.340
So what's the plan?

00:44:59.346 --> 00:45:01.139
You have to have fried chicken for soccer.

00:45:30.544 --> 00:45:34.673
SEONBONG TRADING

00:45:38.885 --> 00:45:40.262
Delivery!

00:45:45.726 --> 00:45:46.935
Your delivery, sir.

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:49.521
Here you go.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.320
Oh, a credit card.

00:45:59.364 --> 00:46:01.450
You didn't bring your card reader?

00:46:01.783 --> 00:46:03.410
I did, but...

00:46:04.119 --> 00:46:06.496
Sorry, please hold on.

00:46:08.665 --> 00:46:10.125
I'll just wire the money.

00:46:11.168 --> 00:46:12.502
Oh, will you?

00:46:12.711 --> 00:46:14.671
Thank you. Here you go.

00:47:01.093 --> 00:47:02.928
- Nine, zero...
- Nine, zero...

00:47:03.011 --> 00:47:03.845
No, nine, one.

00:47:03.929 --> 00:47:05.597
- I mean...
- Nine...

00:47:05.889 --> 00:47:07.349
- Two.
- Yes, then eight.

00:47:13.939 --> 00:47:16.692
Byeong-nam, the real delivery guy is here!

00:47:16.775 --> 00:47:18.277
- The real delivery guy!
- What? Delivery?

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.153
- Delivery?
- Delivery!

00:47:22.823 --> 00:47:25.492
Here's your pig's trotters.

00:47:25.575 --> 00:47:26.576
Hey!

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:29.121
Give me your card reader.

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:30.998
Who are you?

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:32.082
The card reader.

00:47:32.833 --> 00:47:33.959
Give it to me.

00:47:35.085 --> 00:47:37.212
All right. I'll take your card.

00:47:38.338 --> 00:47:39.631
Hold on.

00:47:39.923 --> 00:47:40.882
It's fried chicken.

00:47:44.386 --> 00:47:46.513
- I ordered pig's trotters.
- What?

00:47:51.184 --> 00:47:52.978
It's a buy-one, get-one-free deal.

00:47:53.061 --> 00:47:55.981
If you order pig's trotters,
you get fried chicken for free.

00:47:56.064 --> 00:47:57.190
Please enjoy!

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:58.483
I'm back.

00:48:04.156 --> 00:48:05.824
So this is...

00:48:05.907 --> 00:48:06.783
Hold on.

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:09.453
Hey.

00:48:10.412 --> 00:48:12.164
- The RC car guy, right?
- What?

00:48:12.247 --> 00:48:13.457
What? What do you mean?

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.375
- Take it off.
- Wait.

00:48:15.876 --> 00:48:17.794
- Take it off!
- No!

00:48:17.878 --> 00:48:19.463
Sir, please!

00:48:24.384 --> 00:48:25.677
This is bullshit.

00:48:25.761 --> 00:48:27.512
What the hell do you think you're doing?

00:48:28.138 --> 00:48:29.598
Shut up and come at me.

00:48:29.681 --> 00:48:31.183
Damn it!

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:44.529
Honey.

00:48:46.907 --> 00:48:48.325
- Kang?
- Yeah?

00:48:49.284 --> 00:48:50.202
What's up?

00:48:50.911 --> 00:48:52.537
What should we have for dinner?

00:48:54.081 --> 00:48:55.165
Anything's fine with me.

00:49:00.295 --> 00:49:01.505
Are you that worried?

00:49:03.256 --> 00:49:04.174
Huh?

00:49:12.808 --> 00:49:14.476
- Hey, come here.
- What?

00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:16.603
- I said, come here.
- What? No.

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:17.938
- Sir...
- Come here.

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:20.691
- Come over here!
- Hold on.

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:26.113
The hell are you doing, you bastard?

00:49:26.989 --> 00:49:28.240
Hey, put that down.

00:49:28.949 --> 00:49:30.367
Put that down!

00:49:31.159 --> 00:49:32.661
- Put it down.
- Put it down.

00:49:59.062 --> 00:50:01.064
You think you can get me that easily?

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:11.575
- Bring it on!
- Bring it on!

00:50:11.658 --> 00:50:12.534
You heard him, right?

00:50:24.212 --> 00:50:25.589
There's an emergency!

00:50:26.381 --> 00:50:28.008
Are you okay, Byeong-nam?

00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:29.092
Jeong-hwan!

00:50:29.176 --> 00:50:31.928
Byeong-nam and Nam-yeon won't answer!

00:50:32.012 --> 00:50:33.513
You have to go in and help!

00:50:33.597 --> 00:50:34.848
Me?

00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:37.100
Okay, I'm on it right now.

00:50:42.856 --> 00:50:44.316
Bring it on, you bastards!

00:50:45.817 --> 00:50:47.027
Jeong-hwan!

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:49.112
Byeong-nam! Are you okay?

00:50:49.196 --> 00:50:50.906
Why did you come?

00:50:52.491 --> 00:50:53.533
Ms. Jung!

00:50:55.327 --> 00:50:57.204
Hey, are you okay?

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:04.628
Don't mess with a former artilleryman!

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:11.093
- Oh, no.
- That kid.

00:51:19.559 --> 00:51:21.061
Jeong-hwan, what's going on?

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.522
Byeong-nam! Nam-yeon!

00:51:23.605 --> 00:51:25.565
Please answer me! Anyone?

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:26.608
Come on!

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.537
You're one strong lady, huh?

00:51:38.912 --> 00:51:39.871
The hell are you looking at?

00:51:39.955 --> 00:51:41.790
Please stop hurting us.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.210
Answer me when I'm asking nicely, then.

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.045
What are you guys?

00:51:47.129 --> 00:51:51.758
You can't hit us then expect us to answer.

00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:53.051
Why don't I hit you nicely, then?

00:51:53.802 --> 00:51:56.013
Hey, just get rid of them.

00:51:56.096 --> 00:51:58.557
- Get rid of us?
- Get rid of them.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.808
- What?
- Let's go.

00:51:59.891 --> 00:52:01.685
No, wait.

00:52:02.019 --> 00:52:03.895
- Get off me.
- Let's go.

00:52:13.572 --> 00:52:14.615
Mr. Choi!

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:16.199
- Kang!
- Kang!

00:52:19.745 --> 00:52:20.829
Sorry, I took too long.

00:52:20.912 --> 00:52:22.205
Oh, goodness.

00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:24.041
We're safe now.

00:52:27.252 --> 00:52:29.755
You didn't take long at all.

00:52:31.256 --> 00:52:32.299
Sorry.

00:52:41.099 --> 00:52:42.142
What are you doing?

00:52:42.934 --> 00:52:44.061
Get him.

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:45.687
You're dead.

00:53:38.573 --> 00:53:39.533
Oh, my.

00:53:45.163 --> 00:53:46.081
Are you okay?

00:53:46.164 --> 00:53:47.499
Are you okay, Ms. Jung?

00:53:47.582 --> 00:53:49.334
Yes, I'm fine.

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:55.424
Is everyone okay?

00:53:55.507 --> 00:53:56.466
Yeah, we're fine.

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:58.218
Took you long enough to check on us.

00:53:58.302 --> 00:54:01.430
Nam-yeon, the GPS tracker
is located by the entrance.

00:54:01.513 --> 00:54:03.098
Is there a room there?

00:54:03.181 --> 00:54:04.975
Oh, gosh.

00:54:05.058 --> 00:54:05.976
My legs are killing me.

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:11.106
What the...

00:54:15.027 --> 00:54:16.194
It's a button?

00:54:18.864 --> 00:54:19.948
I got it.

00:54:22.284 --> 00:54:23.619
Yes!

00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:27.331
All right!

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:13.794
What took you so long?

00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:15.837
It's a long story.

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:18.715
What did you tell your wife to come here?

00:55:20.008 --> 00:55:21.718
I didn't say anything.

00:55:22.928 --> 00:55:24.179
She told me...

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:32.187
to save everyone.

00:55:32.771 --> 00:55:33.814
Go.

00:55:36.608 --> 00:55:39.486
Whatever it is, I guess they need you.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:41.196
Can I really go?

00:55:43.198 --> 00:55:44.366
Just don't get hurt.

00:55:45.409 --> 00:55:46.868
And don't come home too late.

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:49.913
Do-yeon won't go to bed until you're home.

00:55:49.997 --> 00:55:50.914
Okay.

00:56:19.901 --> 00:56:20.777
What happened?

00:56:20.861 --> 00:56:22.654
I have no idea.

00:56:22.738 --> 00:56:24.156
They didn't steal anything from us.

00:56:24.239 --> 00:56:25.282
You moron!

00:56:25.365 --> 00:56:27.451
Are you saying
they just came to mess with us?

00:56:28.368 --> 00:56:29.828
You need to come and see this.

00:56:29.911 --> 00:56:31.204
What is it now?

00:56:41.006 --> 00:56:41.840
Look at this.

00:56:52.017 --> 00:56:53.810
Who are those guys?

00:57:00.609 --> 00:57:02.110
What are all these?

00:57:08.867 --> 00:57:10.869
What are these?

00:57:10.953 --> 00:57:13.622
It was dark,

00:57:13.705 --> 00:57:15.874
and they all looked the same.

00:57:15.958 --> 00:57:17.000
This was the best way.

00:57:19.795 --> 00:57:21.588
My goodness.

00:57:21.672 --> 00:57:23.006
I'm not surprised.

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:24.675
How will we find it?

00:57:30.097 --> 00:57:32.766
Man, this is...

00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:33.892
You got all their buttons.

00:57:39.398 --> 00:57:40.565
This is it.

00:57:42.359 --> 00:57:43.360
Here.

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:45.028
Check it.

00:57:45.737 --> 00:57:48.949
Didn't I tell you
to get rid of Kim In-seop?

00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:52.869
You plan to keep up with this shit job?

00:57:54.079 --> 00:57:56.248
I told you to leave no trace

00:57:56.331 --> 00:57:59.835
of anyone and anything
related to the bombs.

00:57:59.918 --> 00:58:04.214
What should I do with you?

00:58:04.673 --> 00:58:06.091
Is he the mastermind behind it?

00:58:06.174 --> 00:58:09.052
Seeing how he's talking about bombs,
it seems to be him.

00:58:11.722 --> 00:58:13.890
Apologies, sir. I'll take care of it.

00:58:13.974 --> 00:58:15.684
Take care of what? Huh?

00:58:22.858 --> 00:58:25.027
Oh, that's...

00:58:27.279 --> 00:58:28.280
What is it?

00:58:28.363 --> 00:58:29.239
Do you know him?

00:58:31.366 --> 00:58:32.409
Who is it?

00:58:33.201 --> 00:58:34.202
Who is he?

00:58:37.205 --> 00:58:38.415
Kim Seok-jun.

00:58:39.583 --> 00:58:41.251
The Minister of National Defense.

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:49.987
HEROES NEXT DOOR

00:59:53.615 --> 00:59:55.742
Where's Dad, by the way?

00:59:56.952 --> 00:59:58.287
He's meeting a friend.

00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:59.496
A friend?

00:59:59.579 --> 01:00:00.497
This late?

01:00:24.229 --> 01:00:25.647
It's Mr. Ice Cream.

01:01:03.935 --> 01:01:06.521
Did you really not know
the Minister took Producer Kim?

01:01:06.605 --> 01:01:09.149
Did you approach me on purpose,
knowing everything?

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:11.360
You think the Minister of National Defense

01:01:11.443 --> 01:01:14.905
would sneak away some bombs
for pocket money?

01:01:14.988 --> 01:01:17.741
Why do these bastards keep messing around
in our neighborhood?

01:01:17.824 --> 01:01:19.284
This is why we can't leave loose ends.

01:01:19.368 --> 01:01:21.203
Who set off the bombs in Changri-dong?

01:01:21.286 --> 01:01:23.747
That's none of your business.

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:25.666
Get a bomb ready.

01:01:25.749 --> 01:01:27.167
To blow up Kiyun-si.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:28.585
What are you doing? Run!

01:01:28.669 --> 01:01:29.503
No...

01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:34.633
