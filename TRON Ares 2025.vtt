She's back.

01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:39.824
As long as the Dillinger
Network is online,

01:24:39.949 --> 01:24:41.034
she'll keep coming.

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:44.287
If she gets me,
she gets the Permanence Code.

The laser. Athena's laser!

01:24:49.834 --> 01:24:52.629
The Dillingers run a wireless
direct link protocol,

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:54.172
so let's use
what's left of the laser

01:24:54.297 --> 01:24:56.758
to ping the network
and trace a path home.

Once you have a connection,

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:00.261
then you can nuke
the whole Dillinger Grid.

01:25:00.386 --> 01:25:03.056
And that's the only way
to stop her for good.

In the 1980s,

[Ares] Dear Eve,

01:47:19.808 --> 01:47:21.017
since I last saw you,

01:47:21.143 --> 01:47:24.688
I've been living
what they call "off-grid."

01:47:25.397 --> 01:47:26.773
Pun intended.

01:47:27.858 --> 01:47:31.153
In my travels,
I've seen incredible things.

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:33.780
Despite its wonder and beauty,

01:47:33.905 --> 01:47:36.908
I've come to realize
that life is...

01:47:37.742 --> 01:47:39.744
Well, it's hard
to put in a nutshell.

01:47:40.495 --> 01:47:42.664
Some days,
I find myself wondering

01:47:42.789 --> 01:47:44.249
where we'll be
a hundred years from now...

01:47:46.042 --> 01:47:47.961
...and how others like me
might fit into that future.

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:53.383
I feel like I might not be
alone with these questions.

01:47:54.885 --> 01:47:55.886
For now,

01:47:56.386 --> 01:47:58.263
I don't think the world
is quite ready to meet me,

01:47:59.347 --> 01:48:01.600
but I am meeting the world.

01:48:02.976 --> 01:48:05.812
And so, when that
introduction finally comes,

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:09.107
as a good friend of mine
once said,

01:48:09.232 --> 01:48:11.193
"Maybe what emerges
from the unknown

01:48:11.318 --> 01:48:13.945
won't be so scary after all."

01:48:17.032 --> 01:48:18.825
Until we meet again,

01:48:19.326 --> 01:48:21.495
