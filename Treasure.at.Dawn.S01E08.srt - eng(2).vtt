00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.640
Do you believe me?

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.960

If he can't cure him,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.320
I'll kill you.

Jiu.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.670
How's the Golden Bloom Banquet going?

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.460
My lord,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.430
all lots are ready.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.500
I arranged for 20 guards

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.830
to go on guard 24 hours a day.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.150
I'll check in person every day.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.830
I won't let anyone in.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.870
I'm in good hands with you.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.670
Do you have any concerns?

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.700
Let me ask you something.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.390
Does Jue

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.430
hang out with those two people

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.060
every day?

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.020
Last night,

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.590
the Princess moved all the medical books in the mansion

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.500
to her room.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.350
She read all night.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.870
She's looking for a cure for you.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:21.740
Really?

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.460
Absolutely.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.540
That's right.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.590
Jue

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.300
is usually playful.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.830
But she's a filial daughter.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.330
My lord.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.530
I'm fine.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.270
Speaking of which,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.750
how are those two people

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.230

Gu Tian wanted to leave.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.190
But I caught him.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.510
Go back and tell Fu Sheng

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.270
to find a way to cure our city lord.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.270
If he can't cure him,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.990
you'll die.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.860
What about Fu Sheng?

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.540
Fu Sheng didn't run.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:09.820
But he's obsessed

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.910
with Song Jingye's case.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.540
He's not focusing on treating you.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.380
My lord,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.030
I don't trust them.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.190
I'll go get you another physician.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.710
Forget it.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.750
It's a long shot.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.430
I didn't count on them.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.380
It's just that Jue trusted them.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.750
So I gave them a chance.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.670
If they can't cure me...

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.620
If they can't cure you,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.340
I'll skin them.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.720
All right.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.340
Don't say it to my face.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.230
There.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.780
It's creepy.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.190
Aren't you going back to Shangyi?

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.910
Am I the one who is disloyal

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.540
and abandons friends?

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:18.820
You are.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.270
I'm not.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.620
Are you going to see Song Jingye?

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.580
What else?

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.140
Can you not go?

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.910
Why?

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.030
Stay out of it.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.030
You should focus on treating the city lord.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.140
I'll treat the city lord.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.820
But I don't know how to treat him right now.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.990
I need some time to think about it.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.190
Besides,

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.780
Song Jingye's case

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.030
is no small matter.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.140
If we find something,

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.590
maybe we can find more clues

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:51.950
about the Sealed Book.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.050
More importantly,

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.100
I have to find the Cloud-shaped Jade.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.820
Eat one.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.510
I bought it for you.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.950
To buy it for you,

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.670
I walked three streets

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.870
and spent ten coins.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.380
I smell blood.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.270
Lift it up.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.380
Who stitched him up?

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.580
The post-mortem examiner in the mansion.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.780
Nonsense.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.670
Unstitch it.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.580
Do it yourselves.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:52.820
Why don't you do it?

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.300
Isn't that your job?

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.300
I just ate a meat pie.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:59.710
My master said

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.030
not to dissect a body after eating.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.540
Why?

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.430
I'll throw up.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.580
Wouldn't I?

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.380
Let's do it.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.990
Here are the scissors.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.190

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.780
I'm doing this to find out the truth.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.380
Please don't haunt me.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.990
Just do it.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.780
Unstitch it.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.380
My lady, you've been reading all day.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.910

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.300
I'm overwhelmed.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.670
You're talented.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.540
These are just a few medical books.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.750
I'm sure you can memorize them.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.430
But I don't remember anything.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.910
Fu Sheng meant no good.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.060
He wanted to give you a hard time.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.580
Your heart is beating faster.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.190
Well.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.430
This is the basic content.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.270
I'll list some books for you.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.230
You should study hard.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.910
I'll check on your studies.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.910
It must be the case.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.860
I'll get back at him.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.860
My lady, eat something before you leave.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.620
The cross-section is neat.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.100
What weapon caused it?

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.990
I've been on adventures for years.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.380
I've never seen

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.340
such a sharp weapon.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.190
You murderers.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.710
How dare you touch my brother's corpse?

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:47.780
Don't fight.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.060
We're here to investigate.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:49.910
Shut up.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.060
You did it.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.470
The city lord and Chairman Li

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.750
are both deceived by you.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:55.750
What?

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.540
Do you want to fight us in front of your brother's corpse?

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.620
Besides,

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.100
we are in Xichuan.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.300
You can find us anytime.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:07.930
You might as well

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.670
tell us what you know.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.190
It's about

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.790
avenging your brother.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.230
What else do you know?

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.340
Tell me everything.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.540
Don't leave out any details.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.780
That day,

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.620
I was drugged.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:40.910
In a trance,

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.990
I smelled

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.580
sweetness.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:49.780
Chairman, are you looking for me?

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.990
You're wearing new clothes.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.580
It's nice.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.030
You look more energetic.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.950
It's all thanks to you.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.190
I washed my face this morning.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.100
Okay. Take it off.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.300
Your clothes

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.620
are not suitable for lighting a fire.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.300
Do you want me to be a cook?

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.190
It's much more exciting than that.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.000
I want you to set a fire.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.270
Set a fire?

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.510
Those two guys will investigate the case in the Lin's Mansion.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:25.820
You go set a fire.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.380
Don't leave a trail.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.620
In case they find something.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:30.910
I understand.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:39.460
[Lin's Mansion]

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:43.780
Bad luck.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.980
How could it be our turn

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:45.670
to guard here?

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.440
As long as I don't spend the night here.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.100
Who's that?

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.190
We're here to investigate.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.520
Please do us a favor.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:09.230
The city lord has informed us.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.780
Please.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.780
Thank you.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:11.580
Let's go.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:17.100
Gentlemen.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.870
You just came to Xichuan.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.990
You don't know

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.430
that the Lin's Mansion is haunted.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.780
No one dares enter here

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.750
at night.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.540
This place is haunted?

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.780
Yes.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.780
Since Mr. Lin jumped into a well and killed himself,

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.230
a lot of strange things have happened here.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.230
It's said that Mr. Lin's ghost haunts this place.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.950
His ghost was seen

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.990
crawling out

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.380
of the well wet.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.860
Chairman Song was a martial arts expert.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.100
But he was also killed.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:40.950
So,

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.830
you'd better not take the risk.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.620
I still want to check it out.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:45.820
I'm sorry.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.430
We can only send you here.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:49.270
You...

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:53.620
Let's go in there.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.990
I don't believe in ghosts.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.100
I must find it out.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.190
It's a big mansion.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:28.820
This family is rich.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.580
Someone's there.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.780
Why are you doing here?

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.430
The Chairman said

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.140
many people died in this mansion.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.230
The other day,

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.190
Chairman Song also died here.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.620
The Chairman asked me

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:50.620
to set a fire

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.510
and burn down this haunted mansion.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.540
You can't do it.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.510
There's still evidence here.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.270
You can't burn it down.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.100
If I don't burn it down,

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.950
the Chairman will burn me.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.470
Physician Fu.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.030
You saved my life.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.540
I don't think

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.270
you want me dead.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:08.910
I know.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.580
How about this?

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.950
We'll investigate for a while.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.580
If we can't get anything,

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:15.710
you can burn it down.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:17.230
Okay.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:18.540
I'll wait.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:23.750
I'll go in with you.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.190
Good man. You're loyal.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:27.750
You'll have a bright future.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.780
I can't compare to you.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.190
Let's go.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:37.750
Wait a minute.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.590
These two stone lions

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.190
look weird.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.380
Stone lions

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.540
can drive evils away.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.670
They bring good luck

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.710
to the family.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.750
When placing them,

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.620
you should distinguish their gender.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.380
You can't misplace them.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:56.710
Look.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.510
They are misplaced.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.300
And the lioness

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.190
is broken.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.670
It's not good for feng shui.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:04.750
Besides,

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.580
putting stone lions at the door of the mansion

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.780
can keep the mansion safe.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.430
If you put them in the mansion,

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.270
they will bring you bad luck.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.140
There are no cobwebs here.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.340
Who's there?

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.190
Is anyone there?

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:35.540
Who's there?

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.300
Don't joke with us.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:39.950
Come out.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.360
I brought people with me.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.540
Should we call them in

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.300
and go in together?

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:44.820
Okay.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.610
No need.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.190
It's fake.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.510
They gave away the racket.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.140
Catch them.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:01.620
What are you doing here?

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.030
It's not fun at all.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.540
Princess?

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.580
Why are you doing here?

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.220
I'm here to find Fu Sheng.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.060
Hulu said you were investigating.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.430
I figured you must be here.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.180
So you pretended to be a ghost to scare us.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.310
You don't know that Fu Sheng is timid.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:22.660
You're the one who's timid.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:23.700
I came

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.790
to see

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.060
if you were slacking off.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.060
You're slacking off.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.220
Have you memorized the medical books?

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.350
It's just a few medical books.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.580
I've memorized them.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:35.390
Okay.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.470
I'll test you.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:37.790
All right.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.220
What's the situation?

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.350
Don't talk about medical books.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.520
Let's investigate. First things first.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.670
Gu is right.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:46.090
Let's go.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.100
She must have slacked off.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.000
This family is weird.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.540
They put a birthday painting in such a prominent place.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.710
It's unlucky.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:37.660
And it's hard to preserve the painting.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:38.870
The color will fade

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.620
in a few years.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:42.950
You know about it?

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:44.910
For me,

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.390
zither, Go, calligraphy, and painting are the basic skills.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.870
You are wrong.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.390
It's a silk painting.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.990
It has lateral scroll bars.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.180
All four sides are covered with fine silk cloth

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.260
to block moisture.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.660
It can be preserved

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:00.620
at least for two or three hundred years.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.430
Its corners will get moldy.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.700
It's better to preserve it in a cabinet.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.790
It would be a waste

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.510
to put it in a cabinet.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.700
Cocky.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.180
Pedantic.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:12.620
Guys.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.220
Why is there a monkey in the painting?

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.430
It's holding a peach.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.470
You guys keep arguing.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.540
I'll take a look over there.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:27.740
Why are you staring at me?

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.180
I don't want to talk about a monkey with you.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:31.620
Gu Tian.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:32.440
Gu Tian.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.350
Come here if you dare.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.430
Cut it out.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:36.510
Be careful.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.700
Why is there a peach?

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.310
I'll check it out.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.030
Where's the monkey?

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.500
It's weird.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.580
There was a monkey.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:01.870
Oh, my.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.580
The monkey came out of the painting.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.470
Chase it.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:07.260
Chase it.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.100
That way.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:14.620
Don't let it get away.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.910
Am I wrong?

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:41.220
No.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:42.620
I saw it, too.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.100
It's weird.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.100
No.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.650
My brother is waiting for me at home.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.640
I have to go.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:49.830
I'll walk you out.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.910
I'm safe

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:52.870
with your protection.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.540
Check it out.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.220
It looks like someone else has been here.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.390
Look at the dust.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:07.830
Gu Tian.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:17.620
No.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.180
I haven't burned the mansion yet.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.620
Forget it.

Fu Sheng is still in there.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:17.310
Go.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.540
What's wrong?

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.270
A peach hit me.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.910
What?

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:30.990
A peach hit you?

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.830
Where did the peach come from?

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:34.830
Did you see that?

Gu.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.810
You didn't even see it.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:39.980
How could I see it?

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:41.700
Did you see it wrong?

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:43.220
No.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:43.910
Look.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.100
Where's the peach?

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.470
There are no peaches here.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:53.790
What do you want us to see?

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:54.990
The painting is gone.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.060
Catch it.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.010
Nonsense.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:15.950
I'll burn this haunted mansion to the ground!

Fu Sheng.

Give me your lantern.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:20.060
No.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:20.730
I...

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.470
I'll burn it down.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:29.820
There is a snake.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.740
Will I die?

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.870
It's a hundred-pace viper! (Deinagkistrodon acutus)

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:41.140
Drink this.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:43.870
Don't drink it.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.260
It's for external use.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.350
But I can see.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.390
I feel better.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.470
It turns out that drinking it has this effect.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.260
I'll memorize it.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:08.910
Wicked money.

Since you didn't kill me,

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:12.060
I'll kill you.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:13.540
I'll kill you.

I'll kill you.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:18.700
Give me the lantern.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.280
I'll burn it.

[Chunyun House]

So you guys came back?

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.320
It's so weird.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.290
I've been out there for years,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.250
but this is the first time I've met it.

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:02.520
Hulu.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.760
Did you see that monkey

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.560
when you were there before?

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.400
I was too scared

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.420
to remember.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:12.820
I don't seem to remember any monkeys.

Okay.

I'll make you some ginger soup.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.850
It's so funny.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.610
The monkey came out.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:25.920
I've never had so much fun.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:26.890
Why don't we

go again tomorrow night?

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.010
Forget it.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.600
We'll do it another time.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.280
We can't risk it every time.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:38.600
But

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.280
don't you want

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.480
to know what happened?

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.080
Why is Lin's Mansion

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.890
a haunted house?

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.250
Lin's Mansion is facing north.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.810
Originally, its main hall faced south.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.450
It's a remote place

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.160
and has always been sparsely populated.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.690
Plus, Master Lin was cursed

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.080
by the Golden Monkey,

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.280
which led to the death of his family,

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.240
so the place became even more uninvited.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.570
At first, there were a few agents

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.010
who wanted to buy the house,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.090
but strange things happened.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.310
Some people even saw Master Lin

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.620
coming out with a dragon-head crutch,

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.920
so the mansion became a haunted house.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.720
Businessmen are driven by profit,

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.650
so how could

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.650
real estate agents give up

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.080
on such a large mansion so easily?

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.730
Of course, they didn't want to.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:25.370
Some bold agents

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.320
had hired some swordsmen to stay at Lin's Mansion at night,

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.000
but the next day,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.250
those people either went crazy

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:31.440
or disappeared,

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.640
so the mansion

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.370
became a forbidden place in the city.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:36.440
All those housing agents

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.130
kept their mouths shut about it,

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.000
so

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.730
whatever strange things happened there

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:41.520
wouldn't be a surprise.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.400
By the way,

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.130
how's your investigation

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.250
into Song Jingye's death going?

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.960
Just running around.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:57.570
Then we'll have to go again.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:58.960
That's great.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.930
What's wrong?

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.840
You're sick.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:07.960
You can't insult me

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.170
even if I don't go.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:10.490
Your kidneys are associated

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.810
with your fear,

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:13.080
and they are black.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:14.880
Your guts are mainly associated

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.080
with strategy,

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.440
so the size of your kidneys

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:19.570
and guts are also related.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.710
What do you mean?

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.520
I mean you're chicken.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:32.470
So what if I go?

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.690
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

Yes,

There's no hurry.

but why me?

I served you as a dog.

You died,

but you still scare me.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.320
Would I still be afraid of you

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.130
if you scared me to death

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.680
and made me a ghost?

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.730
I'll kill you.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:49.200

Song Jingye anywhere,

but why did he choose a haunted mansion

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.200
to make people suspicious?

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.440
Did he really ask me to burn down Lin's Mansion

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.560
just to destroy the evidence?

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.370
Interesting.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:16.850
Interesting.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.040
Based on this image,

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:43.400
find and see who the author

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.280
of Golden Monkey really is.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:49.040
Are you sure this is the Golden Monkey?

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.770
What else can it be?

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.370
Little brat.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.490
You don't know my style of painting.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.400
When will you have a clue?

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:58.850
Tomorrow.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.200
What makes you so confident?

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.610
I'm not confident,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.090
but the Hearsay-capturing Pavilion

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.320
has always done things in a day.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:10.280
What Hearsay-capturing Pavilion?

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.040
You don't even know Hearsay-capturing Pavilion?

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.320
They're the biggest detective organization in Xichuan.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.890
If you pay them enough,

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.200
there's nothing

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.730
they can't get in Xichuan.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:21.130
You don't know anything.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.280
That's interesting.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:33.770
Duan.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:34.440
Wake up.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.320
Duan.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:35.800
Wake up.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.610
You're Hulu.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.970
I don't see you much these days.

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:41.280
Please.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:43.090
Something urgent.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:44.800
One to ten.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.730
How urgent?

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:46.400
Ten.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:47.920
Got it.

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:49.490
Meet me at Chunyun House if you have any news.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:50.400
Okay.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:12.580
Good morning.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.190
Higher or lower?

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:19.260
No chance of change.

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:20.160
Now.

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.170

Come on, now.

Come on.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.140
All right.

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:28.620
Now.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.190
I'm betting.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.350
We're about to lead.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:30.940
Now.

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.670
Higher or lower?

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:32.460
[Lower]
Now.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.180
Come on, now.

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:33.780
Come on.

Higher or lower?

Higher.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:35.270
Now.

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:36.460
Anyone else want to bet?

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:37.310
Higher.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:39.420
Did you lose a lot too?

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.350
Do you think this is a pawnstore?

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.600
Everyone here is a customer,

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.590
understand?

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.180
Besides,

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:43.860
isn't this money?

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.590
Isn't it money?

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:45.910
Lead.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:46.390
Higher.

Lead.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.070
- Lead. - Lead.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:50.630
Don't move.

I'm leading.

Come on.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.220
Three of a kind.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:54.860
We've won.

We won.

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:57.310
What kind of place is this?

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.350
This place is infelicitous.

00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:58.860
I...

00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:59.860
I'll never come here again.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:01.910
How can there be three of a kind?

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:02.390
Come on.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:03.060
Let's continue.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.180
Let's do it.

Place your bets.

Lower.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.910
Go get that fixed.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.140
Might come in handy on a rainy day.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.940
- Lower. - Go ahead.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:13.420
OK.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:13.940
Go on.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:14.830
Place your bets.

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:15.710
Now.

Making a delivery?

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:33.170
Sir.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.410
My master asked me to bring this umbrella.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.320
Put it there.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:37.990
Fix it well.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.380
My master needs it urgently.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:40.380
Got it.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:43.880
Hulu.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.190
Didn't you say it would only take a day?

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.400
Why haven't we heard anything yet?

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.070
A day?

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.230
Heard what?

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.400
Soon.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.520
What I asked them to do

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.400
won't go wrong.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.590
What did you ask them to do?

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.560
What are you talking about?

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.640
What they're saying

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.400
sounds good,

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.040
like you're about to meet a god,

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:02.210
but when you look for it,

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.760
it's as vague as the wind or a shadow,

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.590
as impossible to get.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:09.520
Hearsay-capturing Pavilion's black-suited detective, Feng Qianli.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:11.990
How did you find him?

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:17.120
[Feng Qianli, Hearsay-capturing Pavilion]
I brought

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:18.110
what you asked for.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:19.350
Qianli.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.880
The painting

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.400
Hulu asked me to find yesterday

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.800
is called Golden Monkey,

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.040
by a well-known Xichuan painter

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.160
named Li Zhi.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.560
Where is he now?

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:35.640
He's dead.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.040
You say he's a famous painter,

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:40.760
so his paintings are worth much?

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.470
Li Zhi's surviving works

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:43.920
are worth a lot of money,

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:46.230
but Golden Monkey

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.560
is worthless,

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.230
or it wouldn't have been kept in that abandoned house

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.990
for so long.

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.990
Why?

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.400
Because the painting

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.190
is haunted.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:57.990
It's nine o'clock.
