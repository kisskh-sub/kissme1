(Talent Hunt Program Day 25)

00:01:50.024 --> 00:01:52.040
(Huang Yue 3, Guo Xiaoyu 3,
Ren Jiatong 3)

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.928
(Li Ke 2, Yan Fei 2, Jiang Chen 1)

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.070
I once faced countless competitors.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.070
I fought my way through competitions.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.989
That's how I came here.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.790
If I hadn't gotten
into a top university,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.389
I wouldn't have any chance
to stand here.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.549
I can't make mistakes.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.510
You're different.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.310
You're privileged.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:07.870
No law firms

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.830
wouldn't want

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.990
a person like you who brings clients.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.680
You don't need to work hard,

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:14.550
flatter superiors,

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.349
or compete for recognition.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.270
Yet you easily joined Mr. Zhuang's team.

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:19.304
That's you.

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:20.840
What are you implying?

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.469
Li Ke, enough.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.390
I'm not implying anything. I just mean,

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.310
Huang Yue once said
she envied Ren Jiatong,

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:32.789
but I don't envy anyone

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:33.469
but you.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.710
You probably can't understand

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.909
how much people like us

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.590
cherish this offer.

00:02:39.624 --> 00:02:40.390
But you know what?

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.629
Your constant act of pretending

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.349
not to care about anything

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.629
is really grating.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.488
Yan Fei.

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:54.469
Yan Fei.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.320
What happened?

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:04.744
Mr. Zhou.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.870
What did Mr. Zhuang say?
Will we be punished?

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.909
Mr. Zhou, I decided
on the research approach.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.590
As team leader, I take the blame.
Don't blame Li Ke and Yan Fei.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.030
Mr. Zhuang didn't comment. Leave early.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.629
Enjoy the Mid-Autumn Festival.
We'll handle it later.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.590
Dad. Mom.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.030
Go get your sister.

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:35.949
The crabs are ready.

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:38.110
She won't listen to me.

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.710
She went straight to her room.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.229
Her face

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.509
is as long as this fish.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.430
Aren't you two too old for this?

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.830
Constantly bickering like children?

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.030
Go get Fei down.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.310
I'm not her keeper.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.550
Come on.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.710
Ma already told me.

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:00.310
He said

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.390
Yan Da canceled his date

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.469
with his influencer girlfriend tonight

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.870
just to have dinner with Fei.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.390
I came back today

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.830
to spend Mid-Autumn Festival with you.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.710
Thanks.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.669
Stop the act.

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.669
Look at these dishes.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.469
You told the cook to make these.

00:04:25.109 --> 00:04:27.710
These are Fei's favorite dishes.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.669
Fine.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.309
I'll get her down

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.510
and eat.

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:35.944
Go on.

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:40.309
Wait. What influencer girlfriend?

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:42.229
I didn't know.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.789
What?

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:06.669
I was changing clothes.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.669
Relax. Don't be so jumpy.

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.909
Okay? Mom and Dad don't know
about my suicide attempt.

00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:28.712
Yan Fei.

00:05:29.109 --> 00:05:29.830
I don't care

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.150
what lifestyle you'll choose.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.669
But never mention that again.

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.469
What's wrong? Why so intense?

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.510
You know what?

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.349
I was the first person
besides our parents

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.590
to hold you after you were born.

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:00.070
I watched you grow

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.869
from a tiny baby into a big girl.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.349
You're my sister.

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.789
No one in this world can

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:13.909
bully you

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.869
or hurt you,

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.270
including yourself.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.704
I know.

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.469
No one bullies me except you.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:32.616
Where you going?

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:35.150
I left something at the firm.
I'll get it.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.950
Again?

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:38.909
It's fine. Don't worry.

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:46.270
(Fuchun River)

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.909
Zhubao.

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:48.789
I'm not doing anything this holiday.

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:49.830
I'll spend time with you.

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.880
Okay.

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:56.150
I want this. Strawberry pudding.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.590
Sure, I'll order two for you.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.190
And a mango pudding too.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.750
Okay?

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.472
Okay.

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:11.349
How did you connect

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:12.229
to the hotel Wi-Fi?

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:13.750
I tried earlier,

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.070
but it required a password.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.070
I...

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.950
I did it in the restroom.

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:27.590
The password's in the restroom?

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.768
Right.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.150
Mr. Song's calling. I need to take it.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:37.669
Hello, Mr. Song?

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.030
Okay.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:42.909
I'll do it right away.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.909
I'll call back later.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:53.549
Holy moly!

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:56.744
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:07:57.549 --> 00:07:59.390
Can you eat first before working?

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:01.630
Mr. Song needs it urgently.

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:03.909
Are you eating or not?

00:08:04.429 --> 00:08:05.549
You go ahead.

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:06.710
I'll finish it quickly.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.350
Zhubao, I'm done.

00:08:52.549 --> 00:08:53.549
Zhubao, what's wrong?

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:55.589
I'm going back.

00:08:58.829 --> 00:09:00.789
I've submitted my work.

00:09:00.789 --> 00:09:01.589
I'm starving now.

00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:02.789
Let's grab something.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.829
Work emergency.

00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:04.470
I have to leave.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.429
Working during the holiday?

00:09:07.429 --> 00:09:08.669
What emergency?

00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:14.829
Just say you're mad at me!

00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:17.110
Stop using work as an excuse!

00:09:17.789 --> 00:09:18.350
Aren't you?

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.069
Your boss knows you're on holiday.
One call from him,

00:09:22.909 --> 00:09:24.150
and you ditch me like a fool.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.270
You're complaining again.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.110
Can't you respect my job?

00:09:27.669 --> 00:09:29.309
Some clients are foreigners.

00:09:29.429 --> 00:09:30.789
They don't celebrate the festival.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.350
Then tell your boss

00:09:33.549 --> 00:09:34.589
your boyfriend is Chinese.

00:09:34.709 --> 00:09:35.990
We celebrate the festival.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.350
Stop being unreasonable!

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.069
Do I even matter to you?

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:42.344
And you?

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.104
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.470
Is your heart

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.990
full of work

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:48.870
without me?

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.709
I booked the room
for three days. Already paid.

00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:03.309
You stay here

00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:04.510
and have fun.

00:10:18.652 --> 00:10:21.000
(Qing City)

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.150
Coming!

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.968
Mom.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.230
Jiatong.

00:10:58.789 --> 00:10:59.750
Why are you back?

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.429
I'm on holiday.

00:11:01.429 --> 00:11:02.030
So I came back.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.549
Hey.

00:11:06.709 --> 00:11:07.870
Just three days off,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.390
yet you traveled here.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.270
It's exhausting.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.829
High-speed rail is fast.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.110
I brought a cake for you.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.189
This brand's trendy now.
People queue for it.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:18.510
Don't open it.

00:11:19.309 --> 00:11:20.589
I'm off desserts now.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.829
I'm on a diet.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.429
Lin says I'm fat.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.549
He said so?

00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:33.350
Do you think I'm fat?

00:11:34.669 --> 00:11:35.709
Or just old?

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:37.864
Wait.

00:11:43.309 --> 00:11:43.909
Lin.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.390
When are you coming back?

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:46.870
Jiatong is back.

00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:48.488
Mom.

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:51.990
I saw Mr. Lin downstairs.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.230
You saw him?

00:11:58.589 --> 00:11:59.630
He's very busy these days.

00:11:59.909 --> 00:12:00.829
He will be back soon.

00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:03.030
I just texted him.

00:12:03.309 --> 00:12:03.870
But I saw him

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.630
in a car with another woman.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.829
Well...

00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.704
Well...

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.789
Well,

00:12:13.549 --> 00:12:15.230
that's his sister.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.350
They've been good to each other.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.789
Wake up, Mom.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.630
Mr. Lin has been cheating on you.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.789
He has been trying to avoid you.

00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:28.429
He is with another woman.

00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.949
After my dad died,

00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:32.270
you immediately married him.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.829
What now?

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:34.750
Will you pretend

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.549
that everything's fine?

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.549
You've gone too far.

00:12:46.789 --> 00:12:47.669
Divorce him.

00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:50.309
Don't worry.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.230
I'll support you.

00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:12.150
Jiatong.

00:13:13.309 --> 00:13:13.864
Jiatong.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.069
Xiaoyu.

00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:19.390
Didn't you go back to Hangzhou?

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:22.909
I came back early.

00:13:24.589 --> 00:13:25.750
Are you drinking now?

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.390
Let's spend the festival.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.270
Bad relationship.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.949
Bad man.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.630
I don't want any of it!

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.309
Jiatong, listen to me.

00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:45.630
Men can't be relied on.

00:13:47.309 --> 00:13:49.189
He actually left me alone

00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:51.350
at the hotel and left.

00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:54.390
What a scumbag!

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.589
Not just men,

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.110
but women too.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.309
You can only depend on yourself.

00:14:08.589 --> 00:14:09.256
Right.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:11.390
Jiatong, you're absolutely right.

00:14:12.589 --> 00:14:14.470
I have to rely on nobody

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.270
but myself.

00:14:19.144 --> 00:14:19.709
Seriously.

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:28.549
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:32.549
Are you asleep?

00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.896
Yeah.

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:38.309
I must depend on myself.

00:14:38.789 --> 00:14:39.630
Be quiet!

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.589
What's wrong with you?

00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:42.189
I can only rely on myself.

00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:44.510
Enough. The police will
come for you soon.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.909
Police?

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.549
Are the police here?

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.549
Jiatong, I need to tell the police.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.069
I want to sue Zhu Zhisheng.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.750
He is a bad man.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.789
He hurts me.

00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:10.470
Fine. I'll be your lawyer.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.390
I'll make sure he gets punished.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.069
Punish him.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.750
Punish him.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.110
Go to bed now.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.350
I remember.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.789
I remember what you said.

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:23.144
Jiatong.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.709
Will you really make him get punished?

00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.630
Will you?

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:44.470
Where are you?

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.549
I'm at the law firm.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.669
Having dinner with colleagues tonight.

00:15:47.909 --> 00:15:48.510
Don't worry.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.896
Come home early.

00:16:12.155 --> 00:16:21.069
(Guo Xiaoyu)

00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:23.669
The subscriber you dialed
is unavailable.

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:25.230
Please try again later.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.400
Jiang Chen.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.589
Had dinner?

00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:49.150
Actually, I wanted
to join Mr. Song's team the most.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.189
Do you know why
I ended up in Mr. Zhuang's team?

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.429
Because I'm my parents' daughter,

00:16:58.709 --> 00:16:59.789
my brother's sister.

00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:02.709
I'm a spoiled rich girl.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.069
What I like doesn't matter.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:09.950
No matter who I choose,

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.149
I'll still end up in Mr. Zhuang's team.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:13.950
Since childhood,

00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:17.470
my schooling, relationships,

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.270
everything has been arranged

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.710
by my parents and brother.

00:17:22.629 --> 00:17:23.629
If I confront them,

00:17:23.629 --> 00:17:24.789
they just tell me

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.670
this is the best arrangement.

00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:29.470
They never care about what I want.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.789
Doesn't everyone face such dilemmas?

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.389
Take me, for example.

00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:36.869
When my parents divorced,

00:17:36.869 --> 00:17:39.389
they fought for my custody.
No one asked what I wanted.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:45.510
I know.

00:17:48.309 --> 00:17:49.230
Saying these things

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.389
must make me sound overly sensitive.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:53.416
You'll think

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.589
it's easy for me to say.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.430
I'm enjoying privileges but complaining.

00:17:58.349 --> 00:18:00.670
I'm being ungrateful.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.629
I'm being unreasonable.

00:18:04.069 --> 00:18:06.270
You're getting talkative when drunk.

00:18:07.309 --> 00:18:08.670
Don't interrupt. Listen.

00:18:12.629 --> 00:18:14.470
When Li Ke yelled at me yesterday,

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.470
I was absolutely furious.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.950
But I wasn't angry at him.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.309
I was angry at myself.

00:18:23.829 --> 00:18:26.030
I think he was absolutely right.

00:18:27.349 --> 00:18:28.829
I'm just useless.

00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:33.430
You have time and energy

00:18:34.069 --> 00:18:36.109
to throw tantrums and argue,

00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:38.670
but have you ever considered

00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:40.869
standing up and fighting back?

00:18:42.829 --> 00:18:43.629
Fight back?

00:18:46.109 --> 00:18:46.750
Open your eyes.

00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:50.349
Come on.

00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:53.069
Yan Fei, don't sleep here.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.816
Wake up.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.470
You have to help me, Jiatong.

00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:10.069
I can't hold on...

00:19:10.876 --> 00:19:13.020
(Yan Fei)

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:14.696
(Yan Fei)

00:19:25.628 --> 00:19:27.304
(Yan Fei)

00:19:27.304 --> 00:19:28.008
(Yan Fei)

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.789
Hello, Yan Fei. It's Ren Jiatong.

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:45.389
Guo Xiaoyu's wasted.

00:19:45.389 --> 00:19:46.430
Her phone's right here.

00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.784
Hello?

00:19:48.069 --> 00:19:48.789
It's Jiang Chen.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.309
Yan Fei is with me.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.990
Are you

00:19:53.349 --> 00:19:54.216
celebrating together?

00:19:55.389 --> 00:19:55.976
Yan Fei.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.030
Hello? She's drunk.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.510
I don't know where she lives.
Can you come help?

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:01.670
Where are you?

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.936
Here.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.832
Sober up.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:12.230
Your bag.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.750
Listen,

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.710
do you also think

00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:20.549
I got into Jun An

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.270
through a connection,

00:20:25.109 --> 00:20:26.149
not my own abilities?

00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:30.349
Li Ke... Li Ke always says that.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.149
I never think so.

00:20:32.869 --> 00:20:33.480
Really.

00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:39.030
You're such a hypocrite.

00:20:40.109 --> 00:20:41.470
If you insult me, I'm leaving.

00:20:43.389 --> 00:20:43.950
Careful.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.069
Yan Da said

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.990
no one can bully me.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:52.670
But the only one

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.030
who ever bullies me is him.

00:20:56.349 --> 00:20:57.710
Okay.

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:04.789
Be careful.

00:21:10.389 --> 00:21:10.950
Ren Jiatong?

00:21:11.869 --> 00:21:12.520
Ren Jiatong?

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:14.309
Over here.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.030
Jiatong.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.750
Jiatong.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:31.030
Glad you came.

00:21:31.069 --> 00:21:32.670
I had no idea how to handle her.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.109
Hope you don't mind me meddling.

00:21:35.589 --> 00:21:36.264
What?

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.149
Why did she drink so much?
You should stop her.

00:21:43.349 --> 00:21:44.589
How could I stop her?

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.750
She downed three glasses immediately.

00:21:46.829 --> 00:21:48.869
Clearly, she wanted to get wasted.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.190
If you care about her,

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.389
don't let her drink like this.

00:21:53.869 --> 00:21:54.510
Care about her?

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:12.549
Is she okay?

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.869
Why did you
print out Ms. Bai's information

00:22:19.869 --> 00:22:20.670
and cases?

00:22:22.069 --> 00:22:23.789
I wanted to join Ms. Bai's team before,

00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:24.910
so I reviewed them.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.389
Weren't you going home?

00:22:32.389 --> 00:22:33.190
Why are you back?

00:22:33.389 --> 00:22:34.430
I came back early.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.190
Why aren't you home?

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.950
I'm used to
long-distance family reunions.

00:22:42.349 --> 00:22:43.349
They both drank a lot,

00:22:43.349 --> 00:22:44.230
especially Yan Fei.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.389
She'll feel awful tomorrow morning.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:47.950
Let me order some hangover medicine.

00:22:48.349 --> 00:22:49.470
You're experienced at this.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.470
I had a roommate in college

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:53.789
who drank too much often.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:55.829
We took turns taking care of him.

00:22:57.389 --> 00:23:00.069
The delivery will take at least
an hour. Do you have yogurt?

00:23:05.069 --> 00:23:05.789
You should leave.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.389
You shouldn't stay at a girl's place.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:26.510
Tian Min told me

00:23:26.869 --> 00:23:28.270
how impressive you were that day.

00:23:28.629 --> 00:23:29.470
One sentence

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.309
made Jiang Chen
and Ren Jiatong shut right up.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:34.230
With these kids,

00:23:34.389 --> 00:23:36.789
you need to crack the whip occasionally

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.710
to keep them motivated.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.950
You always say the opposite
of what you mean.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:43.990
I think you actually like them,

00:23:44.309 --> 00:23:46.190
or you wouldn't have chosen
two this year.

00:23:47.109 --> 00:23:48.109
I like them?

00:23:48.629 --> 00:23:49.670
They always cause trouble.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:50.789
The Warm Nest case

00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:52.349
has been driving me crazy.

00:23:52.869 --> 00:23:54.389
Yet you claim you don't like them?

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:56.589
You took this case

00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:57.789
because of Ren Jiatong.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:00.789
But then again,

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:02.430
these kids

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.829
need proper training.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:05.510
As the saying goes,

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.510
jade requires carving.

00:24:08.109 --> 00:24:08.950
The finest raw jade

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:10.349
also needs polishing.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:20.136
Here,

00:24:21.869 --> 00:24:23.069
last one, and I'm going home.

00:24:25.069 --> 00:24:25.950
Such a lovely night.

00:24:26.069 --> 00:24:26.710
Are you leaving?

00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:29.629
On such a lovely night,

00:24:29.629 --> 00:24:31.589
if I keep the hottest guy
of Jun An to myself,

00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:33.270
people will resent me.

00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:34.710
I should leave.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.109
You've drunk. Let me drive you home.

00:24:38.349 --> 00:24:39.470
I have a designated driver.

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.430
He has arrived.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:41.789
I need to get back to my daughter.

00:24:42.069 --> 00:24:43.190
Go to your next date.

00:24:44.309 --> 00:24:45.270
Come on.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.270
Bye.

00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:39.470
You're awake.

00:25:42.589 --> 00:25:44.549
Your apartment

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.869
is small,

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.589
but quite cozy.

00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:51.789
Though the sofa, curtains,
and floor colors don't match well.

00:25:56.109 --> 00:25:57.510
Does your family

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:58.750
all speak bluntly?

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.670
Your brother called you
dozens of times last night.

00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:03.710
I answered one

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:04.750
to ease his worry.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.109
But he didn't even say thanks.
He just started interrogating me.

00:26:08.629 --> 00:26:10.309
He demanded my full name, occupation,

00:26:10.309 --> 00:26:11.349
and address.

00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:13.349
Don't mind him.

00:26:13.349 --> 00:26:13.950
That's so him.

00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:17.320
Jiang Chen made me buy this
in case you feel unwell.

00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:20.950
Quite thoughtful.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.230
People need time

00:26:23.829 --> 00:26:25.030
to understand each other.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.430
After some time,

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.349
you'll find him endearing.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.149
Why did you drink so much?

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.869
It's complicated.

00:26:40.109 --> 00:26:41.160
Alcohol's easy to handle,

00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:43.710
but some problems are harder

00:26:43.829 --> 00:26:44.750
to solve.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.430
Just communicate clearly.

00:26:47.869 --> 00:26:49.670
If only it were that simple.

00:26:50.349 --> 00:26:52.069
I know he means well,

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.309
but I feel suffocated.

00:26:58.829 --> 00:26:59.432
You

00:26:59.829 --> 00:27:00.670
don't like him?

00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:03.670
I love him more than anyone.

00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.750
Are you okay?

00:27:07.069 --> 00:27:07.910
I'll get a rag.

00:27:14.684 --> 00:27:16.936
(Day 1 after Mid-Autumn Festival)

00:27:18.876 --> 00:27:20.430
(Drinking Water)

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.950
Got any milk left? Give me a bottle.

00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:28.109
I stayed up all night

00:27:28.309 --> 00:27:30.349
revising Mr. Zhuang's report.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:31.910
I'm exhausted.

00:27:32.829 --> 00:27:34.190
Shouldn't you

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:35.270
have an energy drink?

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:36.470
Milk won't help.

00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:38.990
So stingy.
I'll pay you back a whole case.

00:27:40.589 --> 00:27:41.470
A truckload of drinks.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:42.869
Or a planeload?

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:43.950
Why aren't you working?

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.430
What were you talking about?

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.069
Ren Jiatong, during my case review,

00:27:50.069 --> 00:27:51.309
I thought of a new idea.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:52.776
Let's discuss when you're free.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:54.389
I'm busy.

00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:02.470
You two were getting along before.

00:28:03.069 --> 00:28:03.829
Did you upset her?

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.389
I guess she is truly busy.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:07.629
We're the best team now.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:17.470
Let me know

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:18.710
when you're free.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.750
Whatever.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.589
Doesn't look like the best team.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.869
We were yesterday.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:31.688
What's with the sudden change?

00:28:32.629 --> 00:28:33.589
She is being jealous.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.030
Is she?

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.869
You know who we're talking about?

00:28:37.309 --> 00:28:37.928
Doesn't matter.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:39.869
The point is,

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.789
I know women.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:50.230
Here's a new task.

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:52.549
(Theme: Third Round Task)
(Jun An will represent Warm Nest)

00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:53.629
(to respond to)

00:28:53.629 --> 00:28:56.270
(class-action lawsuit
against Warm Nest Apartments.)

00:28:56.629 --> 00:28:59.400
(If you were on this case, please draft
a litigation assessment plan.)

00:28:59.629 --> 00:29:01.549
(Case details are
in the email attachment.)

00:29:02.349 --> 00:29:04.149
Why is Jun An taking Warm Nest's case?

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:05.149
They made me

00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:06.750
get kicked out by my landlord

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:07.829
on my first day in Beijing!

00:29:07.869 --> 00:29:09.589
Six months' rent was gone!

00:29:09.829 --> 00:29:10.829
Jiatong is also a victim.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:12.270
It's not just us two.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.710
Countless people got scammed
and became homeless!

00:29:15.109 --> 00:29:16.349
Now they want us

00:29:16.349 --> 00:29:17.109
to defend bad guys?

00:29:17.109 --> 00:29:17.750
No way!

00:29:19.629 --> 00:29:20.710
Calm down.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:22.789
This is just a task.
Don't take it so personally!

00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:24.829
I lost years' worth
of scholarship money!

00:29:24.829 --> 00:29:25.829
How can I stay calm?

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.069
Anyway, I can't do this.

00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:29.149
I'd rather quit

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.389
than lose my conscience

00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:31.270
for this dirty work!

00:29:31.629 --> 00:29:32.360
Xiaoyu.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.109
My aunt is also a victim.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.149
As law students,

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:38.149
we shouldn't approach issues with bias.

00:29:40.829 --> 00:29:42.389
Enlighten me then, top student.

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:46.270
Calm down.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.510
Don't get Jiang Chen wrong.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.629
You called Warm Nest bad guys,

00:29:49.629 --> 00:29:50.869
which sounds emotional.

00:29:51.309 --> 00:29:52.109
In this case,

00:29:52.109 --> 00:29:54.470
things went wrong
during capital operations,

00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:56.389
causing widespread collateral damage.

00:29:56.829 --> 00:29:58.030
No company wants

00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:59.869
to lose money intentionally.

00:30:00.109 --> 00:30:01.589
Yes, I should see it legally.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:02.950
But I have feelings!

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.950
In our tenant group chat,

00:30:05.349 --> 00:30:06.670
some couldn't afford new rentals

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:07.750
and returned to hometowns.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.710
Others clashed with landlords

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:10.789
and got arrested.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.470
Some begged for time off work

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.069
just for apartment hunt.

00:30:14.589 --> 00:30:16.069
You say Warm Nest isn't bad?

00:30:16.349 --> 00:30:17.629
What did those people do wrong?

00:30:18.856 --> 00:30:19.430
I'm sorry,

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.149
but I can only empathize with them.

00:30:21.149 --> 00:30:21.990
I can't sympathize

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:23.149
with wealthy corporations.

00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:33.430
Anyway,

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:35.710
Jiatong and I won't do this task.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:40.648
Ms. Bai.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.549
I've scheduled meetings with Warm Nest

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:43.190
next week.

00:30:43.629 --> 00:30:44.990
Regarding the tenants...

00:30:45.349 --> 00:30:45.896
Ms. Bai.

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.984
Ms. Tian.

00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:49.069
I'd like your advice

00:30:49.069 --> 00:30:50.710
on the Warm Nest case.

00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:54.430
If you're here

00:30:55.069 --> 00:30:57.349
to echo Guo Xiaoyu's idealistic speeches
about justice

00:30:57.349 --> 00:30:58.629
and corporate accountability,

00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:59.549
save your breath.

00:30:59.829 --> 00:31:01.230
Jun An doesn't force anyone.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:03.510
You're free to decline this assignment

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.589
or quit the Talent Hunt Program.

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.069
I won't quit.

00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:08.670
Nor will I back down.

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:10.549
Because I am a tenant,

00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:12.149
I understand tenants best.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.789
I'm confident
in creating an effective plan.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.950
Here's my preliminary research.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.950
I've drafted negotiation points.

00:31:21.309 --> 00:31:21.990
Please review it.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.990
(Preliminary Individual Analysis Report
on Warm Nest Dispute)

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.309
Although tenants

00:31:24.309 --> 00:31:25.789
keep filing lawsuits,

00:31:26.069 --> 00:31:28.230
litigation benefits neither side.

00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:29.270
I believe

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.789
the best solution is

00:31:31.869 --> 00:31:33.069
to mediate a settlement.

00:31:35.931 --> 00:31:37.704
(Preliminary Thoughts
and Negotiation Points)

00:31:38.869 --> 00:31:40.510
Proactivity is commendable.

00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:44.190
But these negotiation points,

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:45.510
whose interests

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:46.589
do they protect?

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.430
Where's the practical framework
to reach mediation?

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:50.349
I see none of that.

00:31:50.869 --> 00:31:51.549
Because

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.750
I only saw hollow legal jargon.

00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:56.829
You produced conclusions

00:31:56.829 --> 00:31:58.069
without investigation.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.270
What a waste of your advantage

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:01.270
as an aggrieved tenant.

00:32:02.069 --> 00:32:02.829
Sorry, Ms. Bai.

00:32:03.309 --> 00:32:05.270
This was just a preliminary idea.

00:32:05.829 --> 00:32:07.510
If it's just a preliminary idea,

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.270
you shouldn't have
wasted my time with it.

00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:10.230
Get back to it,

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.910
make this proposal more comprehensive

00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:13.470
and email it to the right people.

00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:15.149
Understood.

00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:20.549
That girl is good.

00:32:21.309 --> 00:32:23.750
Many second or third-year lawyers
couldn't do better than her.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:25.510
Moreover,

00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:27.470
her approach

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.950
aligns perfectly with yours.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.309
She's got some talent.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.710
But why does she
feel more like your actual student?

00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:41.109
You even guided her to conduct research.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:43.869
I'm getting jealous.

00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:45.430
After becoming a mom,

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.309
you become childish.

00:32:49.069 --> 00:32:50.349
But you're being much stricter

00:32:50.829 --> 00:32:52.270
with her than you were with me.

00:32:53.109 --> 00:32:54.470
That makes me feel better.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.389
Are you indirectly criticizing me?

00:32:59.389 --> 00:33:00.190
I wouldn't dare.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:06.470
The harsher you scold,

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:07.389
the more you care.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:10.030
I'm about to lose favor.

00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:18.389
You've got the email.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.389
I know everyone still

00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:22.670
has tasks assigned by your mentors.

00:33:22.869 --> 00:33:23.910
That's the first.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.389
(Case Overview)
But the Warm Nest case

00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:27.270
(Prepare a litigation evaluation plan)
is the key assessment task.

00:33:27.589 --> 00:33:29.270
You can work on both concurrently.

00:33:29.869 --> 00:33:30.430
Work on both?

00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:31.304
Exactly.

00:33:32.309 --> 00:33:33.990
Involving everyone in multiple cases

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:35.670
and progressing them

00:33:36.109 --> 00:33:36.910
better reflects

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.950
real-world legal practice.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:40.040
Additionally,

00:33:40.349 --> 00:33:41.950
Jun An encourages you all to engage

00:33:42.109 --> 00:33:45.430
with actual cases and approaches
within your capabilities.

00:33:45.869 --> 00:33:46.750
It builds experience

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.389
and accelerates growth.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.640
Mr. Zhou.

00:33:49.829 --> 00:33:51.869
What's the point value for the case?

00:33:52.069 --> 00:33:52.950
Is it individual?

00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.789
Sure.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:56.309
Points remain 30, 20, 10
across three tiers.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:59.349
Let me add some pressure.

00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:01.270
I've heard

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.589
that someone has drafted a plan.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:06.629
Who works that fast?

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.990
This shows this person focuses on

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.629
hot issues,

00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:11.549
enjoys thinking,

00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.990
and has legal passion.

00:34:13.352 --> 00:34:13.910
(Case Overview)

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:14.990
A role model indeed.

00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:18.069
Ms. Tian just mentioned

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:19.149
you did well.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:22.149
That was just encouragement.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.109
Ms. Bai wasn't fully satisfied
with my proposal.

00:34:28.269 --> 00:34:28.808
Alright.

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:30.664
Any other questions? Meeting's over.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:31.400
Mr. Zhou.

00:34:32.549 --> 00:34:33.229
I have a concern.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.120
Speak.

00:34:36.549 --> 00:34:37.589
I want to quit.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.688
(Case Overview)

00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.709
Xiaoyu.

00:34:57.629 --> 00:34:58.280
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:35:08.629 --> 00:35:09.192
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:10.830
If you have problems, share them.

00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:12.669
We'll help find solutions.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.510
But withdrawing from this task

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:15.229
means no points.

00:35:15.669 --> 00:35:17.669
You know you would be eliminated, right?

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.310
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

00:35:23.269 --> 00:35:23.990
I've decided.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:26.790
This isn't just about you.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.470
Have you told Mr. Song?

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:31.229
He's your mentor.

00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:33.189
You can't quit without consulting him.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.350
I'll...

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.030
Pretend this conversation
never happened.

00:35:38.189 --> 00:35:39.390
Mr. Song will be back soon.

00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:41.669
Report to him personally then.

00:35:42.229 --> 00:35:44.109
Until then, focus on your proposal.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:48.510
As someone who's been there,

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:50.109
not as a mentor,

00:35:50.149 --> 00:35:50.920
let me advise you.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:53.229
While you're at Jun An,

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:54.269
any job you receive

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:55.790
must be completed.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:57.390
That's professionalism.

00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.696
Do you get it?

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:35.069
Why do you help Warm Nest?

00:36:37.269 --> 00:36:38.589
I understand your anger.

00:36:38.589 --> 00:36:39.790
But I have to do this.

00:36:40.549 --> 00:36:41.669
Just to stay at Jun An?

00:36:42.549 --> 00:36:43.176
Yes.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:45.672
But not entirely because of that.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:50.189
Regarding the Warm Nest case,

00:36:50.189 --> 00:36:51.310
you should understand me.

00:36:51.749 --> 00:36:53.470
Have you forgotten
the distress and panic

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:54.350
that night?

00:36:54.709 --> 00:36:56.669
I stayed in a budget hotel for weeks.

00:36:56.669 --> 00:36:58.109
I maxed out all my credit cards.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:59.830
You almost

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.790
got kicked out of Jun An
because of the video

00:37:02.709 --> 00:37:04.030
challenging Warm Nest alone.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:05.149
Have you forgotten all this?

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:08.629
Now you're rushing to submit your plan

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:09.990
to represent Warm Nest

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:11.749
and sue those defenseless tenants

00:37:11.749 --> 00:37:12.549
in court.

00:37:13.189 --> 00:37:14.549
Won't you have a bad conscience?

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:15.470
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:37:16.229 --> 00:37:18.510
A lawyer's duty is
to solve clients' problems.

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:20.830
If you can't grasp this basic concept,

00:37:22.149 --> 00:37:23.030
you shouldn't be one.

00:37:24.229 --> 00:37:24.950
Listen,

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.430
if being a lawyer means helping the rich

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:28.549
bully the weak,

00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:30.109
then I will quit.

00:37:50.149 --> 00:37:50.696
Yan Fei.

00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:52.200
Here.

00:37:54.749 --> 00:37:55.390
Where is she?

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.109
She took leave.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:00.310
She's being too reckless this time.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.229
Do you know
how hard it is to rent a place?

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.709
You've never rented, have you?

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:10.709
Let me tell you.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.350
First, house hunting is a nightmare.

00:38:14.229 --> 00:38:15.976
Shady agents provide
cheap, terrible houses.

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:18.952
Good agents demand one month's deposit
and three months' payment.

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:20.950
Then finding roommates

00:38:21.269 --> 00:38:22.470
is like opening mystery boxes

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:23.310
by pure luck.

00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:26.109
And landlords raise rents every year.

00:38:26.269 --> 00:38:27.310
We have to move then.

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:28.109
It's exhausting.

00:38:28.629 --> 00:38:31.310
Guys' sneakers, figurines,

00:38:31.669 --> 00:38:33.549
girls' makeup, and plants.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:35.430
We avoid buying things we love

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:36.749
because moving them is a hassle.

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:38.549
No space to keep them anyway.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.549
Do you understand?

00:38:41.629 --> 00:38:42.470
To be honest,

00:38:43.149 --> 00:38:43.910
for people like us,

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.390
finding a decent apartment

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.629
is like winning the lottery.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.149
You're a native Beijinger

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.390
with family properties stretching
from Chang'an Avenue to Sunhe.

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:55.109
So don't casually

00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:57.589
think people as reckless again.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.830
Li Ke, that's enough.

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:01.749
What does this have to do with Fei?

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.830
I didn't mean...

00:39:04.189 --> 00:39:04.709
Hey.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.189
I don't understand

00:39:11.189 --> 00:39:13.390
why there's such a huge gap
between people.

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:17.990
My elder sister

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:20.030
is the brother-supporter type
that people criticize.

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:23.790
After my sister graduated,
she worked hard to pay for my education.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:25.832
She cares more about me than Mom.

00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:27.229
She saved up money

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.189
to support me.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:30.189
I got everything.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.589
My biggest goal now

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.510
is to avoid mistakes,

00:39:34.629 --> 00:39:35.749
get the offer,

00:39:35.749 --> 00:39:37.229
and save a fortune to repay her.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:39.870
But I didn't mean to target Yan Fei.

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:42.629
I don't know
what's wrong with me lately.

00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:47.149
I get it. We're all
under great pressure.

00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.990
But honestly,

00:39:50.709 --> 00:39:52.310
you should apologize to Yan Fei.

00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:54.549
She worked through holidays,

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.350
stayed up nights revising our report,

00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:58.030
and submitted it.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:00.149
She even put our names first.

00:40:03.963 --> 00:40:06.152

00:40:18.568 --> 00:40:21.704
(Jiang Chen, please continue
adjusting the case notes.)

00:40:21.704 --> 00:40:22.390
Ren Jiatong.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:24.229
Did Ms. Bai ask you
to adjust your case notes?

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:25.510
Not yet.

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:32.749
Why? Are you feeling unwell?

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:34.350
No.

00:40:35.669 --> 00:40:37.030
Speak up if you're unwell.

00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.870
Don't tough it out.

00:40:41.629 --> 00:40:42.229
Jiang Chen.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:44.430
You shouldn't be concerned about me.

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:48.310
After all, I don't go drinking at night.
I don't need milk either.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:49.669
So don't worry.

00:40:55.549 --> 00:40:56.390
What's going on?

00:41:00.229 --> 00:41:00.840
Ms. Bai.

00:41:01.189 --> 00:41:01.864
Ms. Bai.

00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.589
Excuse me,

00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:04.510
could I ask you something?

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.790
I've revised the case notes twice.

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.069
I just received your email

00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:10.149
about a third revision.

00:41:10.709 --> 00:41:12.390
I don't know what's wrong with them.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:13.629
Moreover, I think

00:41:13.629 --> 00:41:15.709
if I keep working on case notes,

00:41:15.709 --> 00:41:16.430
it will

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.109
affect my schedule for subsequent tasks.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.470
It isn't efficient.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.629
If you can't even handle case notes,

00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:23.510
how can you do the Warm Nest case?

00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:26.430
I don't see
how these two things are related.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:29.352
Ms. Bai,

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:31.990
the case notes review is a shared job.

00:41:32.149 --> 00:41:33.350
We'll complete it together.

00:41:35.749 --> 00:41:37.709
Ms. Bai, you have a meeting later.

00:41:38.189 --> 00:41:39.910
Let me handle this.

00:41:40.549 --> 00:41:41.149
Jiang Chen,

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:43.149
if you truly think

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:45.109
you've learned nothing
from the case review,

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:47.269
I suggest you switch teams.

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:57.910
Come with me.

00:42:03.549 --> 00:42:05.030
You've got some nerve, kid.

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:06.549
Go ask Zhou Nian

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:08.069
when we were rookies,

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:09.870
who dared speak to mentors like that?

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:11.229
Want to get fired?

00:42:13.149 --> 00:42:13.896
Ms. Tian.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:16.030
I genuinely don't know what I did wrong.

00:42:16.189 --> 00:42:16.950
Why is Ms. Bai

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:18.430
torturing me?

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:22.709
Ms. Bai doesn't have time
to torture you.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:24.510
In our team,

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.510
starting from Ms. Bai,

00:42:25.669 --> 00:42:26.629
every single member

00:42:27.069 --> 00:42:28.069
has been there.

00:42:28.669 --> 00:42:29.830
Having you review case files

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:31.669
is to make you know
what case files look like

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:33.149
and see evidence materials.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:35.310
If you don't personally read
page by page

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:36.390
and word by word,

00:42:36.749 --> 00:42:38.248
you'll never gain visual perceptions.

00:42:38.709 --> 00:42:40.510
You want to be a trial lawyer,

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:43.269
so you need
to know every detail of the case files

00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:44.149
very well.

00:42:44.629 --> 00:42:46.069
Regarding evidence materials,

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.390
you must review every single word.

00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:50.950
Only then can you
understand both sides in court

00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:52.390
and handle things effortlessly.

00:42:54.749 --> 00:42:55.950
Case notes review,

00:42:56.269 --> 00:42:57.030
document drafting,

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:59.470
evidence examination,
debate, and communication

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:02.470
are the five fundamental skills
for litigation lawyers.

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:05.229
Are you already giving up
at the first step?

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:08.310
The problem is,
I've spent a week on the case file

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:10.189
and revised it twice.

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:12.709
I don't know how to do it again.

00:43:15.515 --> 00:43:17.576
(Should lawyers defend "bad people"?)

00:43:17.576 --> 00:43:19.784
(Lawyers' duty is to protect clients'
lawful rights based on facts and law,)

00:43:19.784 --> 00:43:21.768
(not merely speaking
for the "bad people".)

00:43:21.768 --> 00:43:22.548
(The right to defense is)

00:43:22.548 --> 00:43:23.944
(a constitutional entitlement
for defendants.)

00:43:23.944 --> 00:43:25.960
(Especially in criminal cases,
guarding everyone's right to defense)

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.040
(is essential to ensure fairness
and prevent wrongful convictions.)
