[Episode 12]

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.930
This color is lovely.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.820
Yeah.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.570
This one's especially

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.820
good for women.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.290
Right.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.980
What about mine then?

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.690
And mine is...?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.410
This is a dry red.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.740
Huacan's shipment
should have arrived by now.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.130
Remind Duoji.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.740
Tell him to check it quickly.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.690
We need to ship it out soon.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.490
Okay.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.460
It's pretty urgent.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.050
Got it.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.930
Mom.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.330
What time did you finish drinking
last night?

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.170
I haven't seen my old classmates
for a long time.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.780
We were having fun,
so I had a few more glasses.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.170
So the raw materials gap

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.130
was filled by Mr. Wang

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.730
from Huacan?

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.130
Yes.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.690
You actually

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.940
partnered with Huacan.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.540
How come you didn't tell me

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.060
about something this big?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.780
Should I tell you as your son

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.730
or as your competitor?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.450
Alright.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.100
As long as it's resolved.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.820
I just acquired a winery in Australia.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.690
They have a lot of experience

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.060
producing Pinot Noir dry reds.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.060
I thought they'd be useful

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.980
for the company's

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.500
long-term development.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.340
But it seems

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.060
you need them more right now.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.660
At the very least,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.060
their expertise and brewing methods

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.170
can help you speed up
the delivery of this Pinot Noir.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.220
I've already given them the heads-up.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.130
Are you listening?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.130
Yes.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.500
Thank you, Mom.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.980
I think

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.130
it's more appropriate

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.540
for you

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.340
to thank Tianlu

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.450
as a competitor.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.010
Bye.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.220
Okay.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.540
You always struggle

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.220
with this move.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.220
Alright.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.100
Repeat this move and that one

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.980
a hundred times in a row.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.980
Otherwise,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.980
if Ms. Guan finds out,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.780
it'll be a disaster.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.450
Okay.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.730
Yes, Madam.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.540
Alright.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.730
Head back now. Come again next time.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.100
Hey kid, who are you looking for?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.340
I'm looking for Ms. Tan.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.060
Ms. Tan Siting.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.290
You're so young.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.140
How did you find this place
all by yourself?

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.660
The teacher
at the training center told me.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.780
It didn't seem far,
so I walked here myself.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.610
Impressive, right?

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.290
No.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.490
That's dangerous.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.050
Don't do that again.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.540
I know.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.490
But you probably
won't see me often from now on.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.170
I won't be taking classes there anymore.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.250
Why?

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.140
My grandma said I'm about to
start middle school,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.660
and I need to focus on my studies.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.170
How about we exchange contact info?

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.140
Sure.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.810
Awesome.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.460
I'll scan your code.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.980
Here.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.540
Done.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.490
Added you.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.250
Okay.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.050
That way,

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.580
if you ever need anything,
you can reach out to me.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.250
And if I need anything,
I can contact you too.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.370
Ms. Tan,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.170
actually, I came today

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.140
to share something with you.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.780
What is it?

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.340
Beautiful, right?

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.930
This is my mom.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.660
You always asked me

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.340
why I love ballet.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.020
She was a ballet dancer too.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.930
Even though I've never met my mom,

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.140
I carry her in my mind.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.220
She was the kind of person
who shone brightly.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.700
Dad secretly told me

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.340
that my mom has turned into a swan.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.930
She went off to chase her dreams.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.540
But I know

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.580
she's passed away.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.290
Look,

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.780
when she's up on her toes,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.460
doesn't she really look like a swan?

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.250
After Dad gave me this photo,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.100
I've kept it safe ever since.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.580
All my classmates

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.810
have moms.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.810
But for me, it's always been

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.780
either Grandma or Dad.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.780
And later,

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.020
there was also Ms. Wen.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.220
But she's not my mom.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.290
I never dare

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.460
mention my mom at home.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.540
Because whenever I do,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.490
my grandma gets really upset.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.810
But when I'm sad,

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.900
I secretly look at this photo.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.980
I just watch her dancing.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.220
Later,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.580
I started bringing it
to parents' meetings

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.900
and school events.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.170
I even brought it

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.250
to my model airplane competitions.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.410
It makes me

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.930
feel like

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.370
she's always with me.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.340
Over time,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.610
it became a habit.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.540
Really?

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.170
Last time

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.660
you said

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.730
learning ballet

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.700
requires sacrifice from a young age.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.410
Yeah.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.780
You have to endure the pain.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.100
So I was wondering

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.410
if it hurt a lot

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.020
and made my mom want to cry

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.730
when she was practicing

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.730
on her toes.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.410
But

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.050
chasing dreams

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.410
is always hard.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.850
So my mom must have struggled a lot.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.170
If she were here,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.340
I'd give her the biggest hug.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.580
Le.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.820
Do you like Ms. Wen?

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:20.820
Then

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.340
do you want her to be your mom?

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.460
She's marrying my dad,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.100
not me.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.370
Ms. Wen is really nice to me.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.730
And I like her very much.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.890
But

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.340
she likes me because of my dad.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.580
I like her

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.700
because of my dad too.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.370
So whether she becomes my mom

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.060
is up to my dad.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.420
It doesn't matter if I want her

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.340
to be my mom.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.890
Have you been happy all these years

00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.980
without a mom?

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.180
I think I've been pretty happy.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.130
But it's not like I don't have a mom.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.340
She's just

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.850
supporting me in a different way.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.650
I'm used to it.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:16.730
I love her so much.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:18.770
I never dare

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.010
say any of this at home.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.700
But today I finally let it all out.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.180
Feels so good.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:27.650
Ms. Tan,

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.700
apart from Tudou and Yang Zihuan,

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.100
you're the one
who knows my secrets best.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.420
I'm honored.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.370
Can you keep this conversation
between us?

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.100
Of course.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.460
Secrets are meant to be kept.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:00.580
Alright.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.370
Head home now.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.370
Remember,

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.730
don't wander off alone like that again.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.250
Got it. Thanks, Ms. Tan.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:09.890
Bye.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:10.890
Bye.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.130
Bye.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.060
Maybe I shouldn't

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.700
fight for Le's custody.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.460
I don't want him to be unhappy.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.300
Or to lose his happiness.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.220
I'll just stay in his life as a friend.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:47.860
Tan Siting,

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.460
it's time to move forward.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.940
Tan Siting's the principal dancer
with Queen Ballet.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.650
Her persistence and passion for ballet

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.460
are truly moving.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.650
It's just like Cygne's

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.980
dedication and pursuit
of brewing techniques.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.980
Just imagine

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.130
the classic ballet Swan Lake,

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.940
with its graceful spins,

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.180
paired with swirling wine in a glass.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.620
It's a perfect

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:27.980
visual

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.940
and symbolic match.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:34.460
Mr. Feng,

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.580
what do you think?

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.020
Not bad.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.780
This is...

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.580
This isn't the final version, is it?

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.180
Right. These are just some raw clips.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.860
I'm sure you'll love

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.620
the final version even more.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:56.940
Okay.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.700
Our partner this time

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.700
is a China-chic stationery brand.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.860
They hope to
collaborate closely with us.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.340
The main focus will be
on co-branded merchandise.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.660
Plus online and offline activities

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.620
targeting the K-12 demographic.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.100
This will also

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.460
help expand our company's

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.650
brand influence.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.740
Xu has explained it very clearly.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.740
We always prioritize brands

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.770
with positive values.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.770
Partnering

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.890
with a stationery brand kids love

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:24.700
could really benefit

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.340
the games

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.060
we're about to launch.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.020
Shan,

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.300
set up a meeting

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.660
with their leader as soon as possible.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.100
You and Huai

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.300
need to iron out

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.620
all the details carefully.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:35.820
Yuan,

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.740
we've already reached out.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.500
They'll be visiting us here.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.420
Perfect.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.580
Huai,

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.300
you'll handle the reception.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.180
Got it. No problem.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.340
Xu,

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.580
prepare a couple of our games.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:47.340
Alright.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.420
Contact Bao or me

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.060
if any issues come up.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:50.700
Alright.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.300
Go, go.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.180
Everyone, go for it.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.180
Hey, Bao,

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.300
could you help me check

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.300
if any changes are needed?

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.380
[China chic]
Let me see.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:00.780
[Ms. Zhuang]
Mr. Wang,

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.460
we cordially invite you

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.900
to our school

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.180
tomorrow at 2 PM.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.700
We'll be showing this year's progress

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.860
for investors and sponsors.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.420
Those who competed abroad.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:13.820
This is Yufan.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.300
And this is Huan.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.660
They're both exceptional students.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.420
Recently,

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.580
we've done

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.700
a bunch of curriculum changes.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.460
We've worked
with some foreign music schools...

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.660
She's seven.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.180
Perfect age.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.420
Six to seven years old.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.740
And dance training

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:34.300
should start young...

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:34.780
You'll see

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.300
great things in the future.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:37.900
Mr. Wang, you might not know.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.860
But our school was built

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.420
step by step

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.620
hrough everyone's collective effort.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.700
Now that you're here,

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.060
have you noticed
how things have changed here?

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.260
It's all thanks to your leadership,
Ms. Zhuang.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.060
Not really.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.260
A documentary crew

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.100
is filming at the school.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.420
Let's go and check it out later.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.660
- Really?
- Wonderful.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.340
Look at this girl.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.020
Yes.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:57.300
Not easy.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.820
I'll snap one for you. Take a look.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:14:59.300
Alright.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:14:59.820
Yes.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.220
Come on.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.820
It's a team effort.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.420
Actually, we currently...

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.700
Are you that gentleman?

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.220
The one

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.900
who funded the art education school

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.420
in Hongyuan County, Sichuan?

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:13.700
Ms. Zhuang said

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.820
you'd be here today.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.340
You are...?

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:22.900
I'm Qu Zhen.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.700
Duoji told me...

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.220
Yes.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.100
I asked him to deliver
the postcard to you.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.380
You look just like I imagined.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.300
So you're Qu Zhen.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.940
I received your postcard.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.300
You came all this way from home

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.420
to dance here. That's incredible.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.940
I really should thank you.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.500
Keep it up.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.420
I will.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.060
Mr. Feng,

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.060
could we get a photo together?

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.020
Sure. Let's take one.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.300
We currently have students...

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:55.940
Like...

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.100
Yufan.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:57.700
Yufan.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.020
Right.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:58.980
Zheng Yufan

00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.700
is preparing

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.020
for the YGP

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:01.740
Japan regional competition.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.220
Mr. Feng.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:03.460
Mr. Feng.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.300
So

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.460
we're definitely going to win awards.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.140
Mr. Feng, let me introduce you.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.220
This is Mr. Wang.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:10.900
That's eloquent.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.340
Long time no see.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:14.900
You two know each other?

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.300
Ms. Tan.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:20.820
This is Ms. Tan Siting.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.060
I suppose you've all admired her
for a long time.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.660
Let me introduce our sponsors.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.220
This is Mr. Wang.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.540
This is Mr. Zhang.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.740
This is Mr. Wang.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.540
You're already familiar with him.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.660
This is Mr. Hu.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.900
And this is Mr. Feng.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.660
Ms. Zhuang, everyone's here.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.420
Shall we take a group photo?

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.100
Sure.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.780
Come on.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.220
All together.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:46.660
Step forward a bit.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.060
Mr. Feng, you're tall and handsome.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:48.900
Stand in the middle.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.060
Alright.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:50.620
Come on. Right.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:51.500
Okay.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.020
Everyone, look over here.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:53.660
Come on.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.460
Three, two, one, okay.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.420
One more.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:58.860
Three, two, one.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.020
That's good.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.660
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:02.740
Let's go.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:08.260
Okay.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.460
Everyone, please follow me

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.020
to get a closer look at ballet

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.300
and experience its charm.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:13.660
Right.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:13.860
Come on.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.100
They're filming a documentary.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.180
Okay.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:16.820
Come on.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.220
Take a look.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.300
Steady your footing a bit more.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.540
Okay.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.020
Expression.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:05.380
Okay.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.860
Take a break now.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:18.500
Ms. Tan, be careful.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.220
Are you hurt?

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.300
I'm sorry.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.140
Do you want to lie down?

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:44.860
Yuan.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.300
What happened?

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.020
Where did you hurt? Let me see.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.660
Shuhan, what are you doing here?

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:50.820
Siting,

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.020
what's going on?

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.300
What happened to you?

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.900
Just a minor hairline fracture.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.900
How did it get so serious?

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.780
It's nothing. I just...

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.260
You should be worried about Yuan.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.780
He took the hit for me and ended up

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.740
getting hit in the head.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.780
Don't say that.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.060
It's not a big deal.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.060
Yeah, right.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.740
As long as you're not dead.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.580
Now it hurts, huh?

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.060
You two, really...

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.900
My head hurts.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.300
You showing up gives me a headache.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.060
No...

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.260
How are you feeling?

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.540
Doctor.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.820
Doctor, how is he?

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:20.780
His head...?

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.020
Mild concussion.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.820
Concussion?

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.460
Generally, if he's awake,
he should be fine.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.540
But he needs to stay
for observation overnight.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.900
If he's all good after the checkup
tomorrow morning,

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.900
he can get discharged.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.340
You too.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.260
Your blood pressure
is a bit high right now.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.260
It might be caused by the trauma.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.500
I recommend you also stay
for observation tonight.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.580
You can leave after the checkup tomorrow
if everything's fine.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:42.580
Look,

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.500
doctor.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.260
My brother

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.340
works in IT.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.500
He relies on his brain for his job.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.820
Please make sure
he gets a thorough check-up.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.980
And you're absolutely right.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.740
They both need
comprehensive examinations.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.300
We can't risk
any long-term complications, okay?

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.300
If you're concerned,

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.660
we can also do an MRI.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.140
Are you experiencing

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.460
any other discomfort?

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.540
Any dizziness?

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:02.300
No.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.020
Any nausea?

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:03.340
Not really.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.060
Okay, that's good.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.140
We'll wait for the morning results

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.540
and reassess then.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.260
Thank you, doctor.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:10.780
Thank you.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.580
Appreciate it.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.020
Thanks.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:12.540
Thank you, doctor.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.300
Thank you, doctor.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:13.740
No problem.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.700
No dizziness? No nausea?
Are you sure you're okay?

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.260
I'm really fine.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.300
Let me check again...

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:18.300
Shuhan.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:18.860
Hey,

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.180
you didn't tell Mom and Dad, did you?

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.900
If I had told them,
they'd have rushed over here already.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.060
You must not tell them.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.660
This minor injury will heal
in a couple of days.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.060
Really?

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.620
You need to get that MRI done properly.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.500
That's what the doctor said.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:31.100
And you too...

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.420
Stop talking.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.820
My head hurts even more.
It's starting to hurt again.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.820
Just go.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.820
I'll take care of her.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.460
You should go.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.300
Why are you telling me to leave?

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.220
Stop pushing me away.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:39.740
It's fine. Just go.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.980
Siting, focus on recovery.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.580
You should go back and rest.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.740
Take care of yourself.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.500
Listen,

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.460
don't have any brain damage.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.580
I'm fine. You should go.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:47.980
So careless.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.580
What if he really gets impaired?

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.580
How are you feeling now?

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.180
Siting,

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:56.940
have some water.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:57.780
It's fine.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.740
I can do it myself.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.580
Just rest.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.220
Use the straw. Drink it like this.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.180
Is it too hot?

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:04.700
It's okay, right?

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:06.980
Sit down.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:07.580
I'm fine.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.980
I'll bring some soup for him tonight.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:18.980
Remember, okay?

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.420
And her...

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.940
This is Ms. Wen.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.180
I just wanted to let you know

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.340
we've moved

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.660
to Classroom No. 2 today.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.980
I was worried you might not find it,

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.180
so I'm telling you in advance.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.020
Alright.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:34.980
See you soon.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.220
What's with the media these days?

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.060
Making a big deal
out of nothing and writing articles.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:40.900
Look at this.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:41.340
Look.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.780
What article?

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:44.260
Look.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.300
"Accident

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.500
at Ballet School

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.940
Filming Location".

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:51.500
Here.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.660
Isn't that Ms. Tan from our school?

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.300
It really is.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.500
Heard she's quite famous.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:58.940
No wonder it made the news.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:01.500
Doctor,

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.460
how is the patient in bed 28?

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:04.980
Bed 28?

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.780
A minor hairline fracture.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:11.740
Hairline fracture?

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:12.740
Is it...

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.500
Is it serious?

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.820
Will it affect her dancing?

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.460
I know, Madam. Don't worry.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.740
I'll update you if anything comes up.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.460
Ms. Tan.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:43.340
Ms. Wen.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:44.740
What brings you here?

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.900
Don't get up.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.460
I saw the news

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.420
and came to check on you.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.140
Thank you for making the trip.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:51.660
These news reports

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.580
are always so dramatic.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.900
It's really nothing serious.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.740
I'll be back in a couple of days.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.020
But you look

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.180
pretty bad, though.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.020
What did the doctor say?

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.740
It's fine.
Just a minor hairline fracture.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.460
Doctors, you know.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.780
They're cautious with their words.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.740
It's really nothing.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.220
You still need to rest properly.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.580
After all, it's an injury to the bone.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:09.740
Thank you

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.660
for coming.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.300
Rui was there too?

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.420
Yes.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.140
He was at the school earlier today.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.180
But he's fine.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.460
When I

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.660
got hurt, Mr. Wang

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.260
caught me. He hit his head too.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.540
So we both ended up in the hospital.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.300
How are the preparations going?

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.180
Pretty smoothly.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:30.820
But

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.260
with you injured, a lot of things
must be inconvenient.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.540
If you need any help,

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.820
just let me know.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.580
No, thanks.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.220
Hospitals here

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.220
are really convenient now.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.060
They provide three full meals a day,

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.300
and it's quite good.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.660
But I usually cook for myself...

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.420
Are you hungry?

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.260
The line was so long.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.220
So long...

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:45.980
This is Mr. Wang.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.460
This is Ms. Wen. You've met, right?

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:47.740
Yes.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:47.980
Hello.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:48.980
We've met.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.740
Yuan, why did you buy so much?

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.500
Of course I'd buy plenty of food.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.180
Sorry.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:54.500
It's fine.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.340
I haven't done anything all day.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.940
I really don't have much of an appetite.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.660
You need to eat your meals.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.660
With your head injury...

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.500
It's really risky for you
to be walking around like this.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.180
I'm fine.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.060
I bought lots of things you like.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.580
Oh my, this is way too much.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.340
Would you like to join us?

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.500
No, I've already eaten.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.420
Have a little something.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.300
No. thanks.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.180
Thanks.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.460
Let me help you.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.140
Thanks.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:14.420
This is too much.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.580
They're all your favorites.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:16.020
It's not too much at all.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.060
I told you the hospital has food.
You had to go out and buy it.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.940
Doesn't it smell good?

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:19.940
Yes.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.900
The line was really long.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.940
I just think it was dangerous for you

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.180
to go with your head injury.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:25.980
It's nothing.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.500
What if you got hit again?

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.420
She worries too much.

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:32.660
Here.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:33.940
Thanks.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:34.940
Can we finish all this?

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.940
Are you sure you don't want to join us?

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:37.820
Really, I'm fine. I've eaten.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.260
You guys go ahead.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:38.980
Ms. Wen, have a seat.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:39.940
Have a seat.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.140
Sir,

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:44.940
we're heading out.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.740
Okay. See you tomorrow.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:46.300
See you tomorrow.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.460
Bye.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.460
Ms. Wen, you're here.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.020
Are you off work?

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:49.700
Yes.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.340
Bye.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:51.900
What are you doing here?

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.980
Just passing by.
Brought you some pastries.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:55.900
Okay.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.500
I'll be a little while longer.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.660
Wait for me a moment.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:24:59.500
No rush.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:00.260
Take your time.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.220
I'll just prepare some lessons here.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:02.700
Okay.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.500
Try this.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.060
This place is quite famous.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:10.740
Thank you.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.260
Thanks.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.460
I heard Ms. Tan got injured.
Did you know?

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.740
Yes. I was there.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:38.980
Is it serious?

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.020
Probably not.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.500
She's already in the hospital.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.060
It just rained.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.380
The air outside must be so fresh.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.420
Yeah.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.020
You know what?

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.100
Eleven years ago,

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.180
I went to Paris to see you.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.020
Back then, Bao and I

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.860
had just started
our mobile game company.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.740
During the most stressful
and difficult time,

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.540
when we had burned through

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.700
all the startup funding from his family,

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.820
we were looking
for investors everywhere.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.780
One day,

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.100
I met with a very important investor,

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.300
but got rejected.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.860
I was really discouraged

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.580
and upset that day.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.820
I suddenly didn't want to
hold back anymore.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.780
I went to Paris,

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.060
bought tickets,

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.820
and watched your performances
for five days straight.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:00.340
You weren't

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.940
as famous then as you are now,

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.300
but you were just as dazzling.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.860
Swan Lake,

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.340
The Nutcracker,

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.020
and Giselle.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.180
The audience

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.060
was mesmerized by you.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.500
It felt like I was back

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.300
to the first time I saw you dance.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.260
You were so absorbed,

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:26.860
so lost in the moment.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.540
During the curtain call,

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.940
you looked so happy.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:35.980
I knew then

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.300
that you had let go

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.300
of all the bad things

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.420
and moved forward.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.540
Later, I returned,

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.060
refreshed,

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.300
and continued with my game company.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.100
Then I found an investment soon after.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.700
So I feel that trip to Paris

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.300
brought me good luck.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:02.580
Thank you.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.940
So does that mean we're even?

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.580
We're even.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:20.540
Take it slow.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.140
I'm fine. Be careful.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:22.540
Watch your step.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.260
I can manage.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:23.860
Mind your step.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:24.540
Okay. No, thanks.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:25.540
Careful.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.340
Let her sit down first.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:26.820
Sit.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.340
Sit here.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.060
Careful.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:30.580
Come on.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.660
Take it easy.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.380
Okay.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:33.580
Okay.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.260
Can I use any towel,

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:36.540
Siting?

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.060
Let me get you some water.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:37.780
Any is fine.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:38.420
Thanks.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.060
Just help yourselves to drinks.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.580
Don't worry about us.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.540
Just rest.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.100
Okay.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.380
Here.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.340
Just got back from the hospital.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.100
Wipe your hands.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.380
Thanks.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:54.260
Here.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.860
Have you been eating properly?

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.860
The fridge is empty.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.260
I keep it simple when I'm alone.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.020
There's nothing at your home?

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.540
Just some bread?

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:04.380
Put it down.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.100
You two should head back now.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.060
The doctor said

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.340
if he

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.500
doesn't rest properly,
he could risk impairment.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.340
I'm fine. I'm worried about you.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:14.260
Just go. I'm fine.

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.900
But are you sure
you'll be okay alone at home?

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.340
Should we make you some food
before we leave?

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.100
No need. I can just order in. It's easy.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:19.980
Just go.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.380
Alright then. Yuan,

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.380
let's go.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.340
It's inconvenient for Siting
to be here with a guy.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:24.940
But...

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:25.980
It's fine.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.060
Go back.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:27.620
Let's go.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.060
Call us anytime if you need anything,

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.580
alright?

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.420
Take care.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.700
I'll call you if I need anything.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.340
You guys go back.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:33.980
Okay.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.060
Remember to eat.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:35.700
Okay.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:36.860
You must eat.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.300
He needs rest.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.420
Okay. I know.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.300
Keep in touch.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:40.820
Alright.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.340
Got it.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.900
Okay. Siting knows.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.540
You get some rest.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:45.580
Bye.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.940
Bao said he called you,
but you didn't answer.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.300
Call him back when you have time.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.540
Oh?

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.300
Can you think

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.500
before you act next time?

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.220
Think about Mom and Dad.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.300
Think about me.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.300
Think about

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.060
the more than a hundred employees
who are relying on you.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.740
You just charge ahead without a care.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.580
My head hurts.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.740
It hurts again?

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.420
For real?

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.500
Are you okay?

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.060
I can't stand to look at you.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:23.940
It's upsetting just seeing you.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:26.900
The kids

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.220
all wanted to visit you.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.980
Brought a ton of good food.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.060
My car was practically overflowing.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.540
You're quite popular.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:35.340
Here.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.220
With my popularity,

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.580
should I show off a bit?

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:37.980
Yes.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.300
Show off all you want.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.140
You are what you eat, huh.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.940
To mend your bones.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.580
It's so delicious.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.740
Then have more.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:47.980
This fish...

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:49.980
Really good, right?

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.660
It tastes a bit like my dad's cooking.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.140
Ms. Zhuang,

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.020
I didn't expect Feng Rui

00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.980
to also invest in our school.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.540
He's always held onto a dream
about ballet.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.740
After his vineyard found some success,

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.540
he contacted me.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.740
Said he started
an Arts Education Foundation

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.220
and wanted to invest in our school.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.500
I never heard you mention it before.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:23.940
You both

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:24.980
took

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.300
different paths.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.980
And you've both done well.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.540
I didn't want to

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.980
bring up old memories.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.980
I just hope you're both doing well.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:40.580
I was thinking

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.900
I'd be back in class
in a couple of days.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.420
Yufan's competition is coming up soon.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.660
Her injury has just healed too.
She needs recovery time.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.140
And then...

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:49.900
Don't.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.180
Listen to me.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.300
Just stay home

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.940
and focus on getting better.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.700
The school

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.700
needs

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.340
a healthy Ms. Tan.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.420
Okay. I'll rest for a couple more days.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:04.740
But

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.460
I won't be going to

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:08.860
the training center.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:09.900
Alright.

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:10.980
I understand.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:18.540
Mr. Feng is here.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:20.420
Sir,

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.020
we're back.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.180
You came back together?

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:27.620
Yes.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.980
I'm not against office romances.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.980
But don't let it go to your heads

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.340
and affect your work.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:36.820
Don't worry, sir.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:38.940
Under your brilliant leadership,

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.220
we can overcome any obstacle.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.660
This recent disaster proved that.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:42.380
By the way,

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.780
I need to talk to you about something.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:44.100
Sit.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.100
I plan to expand our winery.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.020
First,

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.140
I'll acquire 300 more acres of vineyards

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.380
to plant the grape varieties we need.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.740
Aren't you moving a bit too fast?

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.900
We haven't even shaken off
the shadow of the mudslide.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.340
It's precisely because of this incident

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:06.740
that I'm more confident.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.860
Most of our previous partners

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.460
have chosen to continue working with us.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.020
I can feel their trust.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:14.940
But

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.940
what if something similar
happens again...

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.060
Wine itself is a gift

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.820
from nature.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.980
Natural disasters
are part of nature too.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.420
If we can't avoid them,

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.860
we'll just tough it out.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:33.540
- Mr. Bao.
- Mr. Bao.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:33.820
Mr. Bao.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:34.300
Hello, Mr. Bao.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:40.380
Thanks.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.540
Why are you coming so close?

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.380
I'm looking at your heroic mark.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.580
You played the hero this time.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.060
You risked your life for her.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.220
Siting must be so touched.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.700
I think

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.340
she just feels guilty towards me.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.140
Then you should press your advantage.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.900
Have you heard that saying?

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.420
"Just a little bit closer,

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.420
and I'll go with you."

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.900
You made that up, didn't you?

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.980
If you want to win the beauty,

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:08.940
you have to

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:10.820
create opportunities
where there are none.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.540
Is it money you lack?

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.140
You lack romance.

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:18.980
Have you finished with those new

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.740
code modules?

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.980
You always brush me off
when we talk about this.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.100
Mr. Bao.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.860
Go on.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.420
Fine.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.100
Think it over carefully.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:33.820
Mr. Bao.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.060
Mr. Bao, take a look at this.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:35.460
Mr. Bao.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.860
Mr. Bao, please look at this.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.460
Are you here to go camping?

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.340
Yeah.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.420
Camping at your place.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.900
I brought lots of your favorite food.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:17.500
Look,

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.620
I had my mom prepare it specially.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:21.580
Enough to last you three days.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:22.900
I'll put it in the fridge for you.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:23.980
And eggs.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:24.980
Mr. Wang,

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.020
that miracle doctor you brought

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.380
is truly amazing.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.060
He cured us

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:29.940
of our chronic issues.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:30.500
Exactly.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.180
My waist can even move now.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:31.860
Brush your foot.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.420
And it's not easy for Ms. Tan
to be on her own.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.700
It's great that you can be here.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:37.700
Yes.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:38.740
It's really not easy.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.420
By the way, everyone,

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:41.820
you know it's been hard for her

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.740
to get around lately, right?

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.380
So I'll be assisting her.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.620
If anything comes up,

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:46.820
you can just talk to me.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.060
Well...

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:49.300
Okay. No problem.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.780
Let me get your contact info, Mr. Wang.

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:51.940
May I?

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:54.780
Steps.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:55.900
Can you do it?

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.500
Yes.

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:57.780
Is your foot still hurting?

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:58.780
It's better.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.140
Alright.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.700
Let me adjust the leg rest
for your left foot.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.380
More comfortable?

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.420
You're getting more and more thoughtful.

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.060
Okay.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.700
Brush your foot. Engage your core.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:17.780
Good.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.060
Scan my code.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.780
Then we'll contact you for anything.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.020
What else would you like to eat?

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:21.940
Just let me know.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.700
Let you know?

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.580
Last time I came,
I noticed you didn't even have a pot.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.420
So I bought one.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.420
Next time,

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.500
I can make hotpot for you.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.100
Yuan, that's too much.
It'll go to waste.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.020
You like this.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.060
There's plenty more.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:37.580
Siting.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.980
I'll pick you up after class.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:41.500
Bye.

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.140
Bye.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.300
Mr. Wang, let's keep in touch.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.500
Come by anytime.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.020
Mr. Wang is so handsome

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.300
and so kind-hearted.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.260
Ms. Tan,

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.940
what does Mr. Wang do?

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.900
Homemaking services.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.620
Homemaking services?

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.300
Homemaking services.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:22.820
Don't rush.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:23.300
Take it slow.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:28.300
Yufan,

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.820
in this dance, you need to express

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.140
that you have already set a goal

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.300
to pursue your dream.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.260
So you must give it all your passion.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.780
Let the judges see your courage

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.260
and professionalism.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.140
That's how you get high scores.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.900
Understand?

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:45.620
Footwork.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.260
Stop.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.220
I can do it.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.460
Why are you stopping me?

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:08.020
Yufan,

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.820
this set of moves is just

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:10.860
an en dedans,

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.300
followed by a fouetté.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.300
You can do it.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.300
But not right now.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.300
Ms. Tan,

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.460
I might be a bit tired lately.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.740
Let me try a few more times.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.060
I know I can do it.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.100
I know you're under a lot of pressure.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.220
But

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.060
rushing won't help.

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.260
But there's not much time left.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.060
And I promised you.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.380
Yufan, relax.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:37.900
I know this variation

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.140
is difficult for you.

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:40.380
But

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.220
if you can push through it,

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:43.980
you'll reach another level.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.380
I think you need to rest now.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:47.620
Alright?

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:54.380
Ms. Tan,

00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.460
actually, I feel

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.820
my old variation was more stable.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.380
Let me ask you,

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.220
what's the purpose of competing?

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.940
Is it just to win a trophy?

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:13.300
Isn't it?

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.220
Of course not.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.060
I'm telling you,

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.580
it's to use the pressure of competition
to push past your limits,

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.380
to improve,

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.940
and to step onto bigger stages.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.020
If you just play it safe,

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.380
what's the point of the trophy?

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.820
You need to overcome not your opponents,

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.900
but yourself.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.500
I know you're very tired today.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.940
So go home and rest early.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.380
Remember what I told you before.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.020
Feel it with your heart.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.460
Cheer up.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.380
I'll come and help you.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:08.420
Here.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.020
Let me get that.

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:11.700
Be careful.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.340
I'll hold your bag.

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:14.660
Okay.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.980
Watch out. There are steps ahead.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:35.940
Chase.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.220
Spin.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.020
You need to express
a feeling of freedom.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:46.580
Continue.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.020
Put more of yourself into it.

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:52.660
You need to...

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.100
Yes.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:53.820
Keep going...

00:40:59.100 --> 00:40:59.860
Again.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:02.300
Be more stable.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:04.940
Begin.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.380
You need to feel it.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.140
Express that feeling of freedom!

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:23.860
Joy!

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.740
Share the feeling of joy.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:26.220
Yes.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:29.860
Continue.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:35.580
I can't do it.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.100
Yufan, you can do it.

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:42.460
Try drawing

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.580
from your own life experiences.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:44.340
From your life...

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.420
I can't feel it!

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.660
I know all the things you're saying.

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.100
But I just can't
express them in the dance!

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.180
Can you please stop pushing me?

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:52.940
I'm not pushing you.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:53.940
I want you

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.620
to unlock your potential.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.260
Because I know you can do it.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:00.940
I can't.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.700
Maybe I'm not as talented

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.620
as you all think I am.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.660
You are talented,
and you are hardworking.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:07.900
Yufan,

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.100
if you want to stand out
in this competition,

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.100
you must step out of your comfort zone.

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.660
Everyone pursuing a dream

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:15.780
goes through this phase

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:16.820
of self-doubt.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.380
But you have to trust my judgment.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.100
And you have to believe in yourself.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.060
I said

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.900
I can't do it!

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.220
I can't even finish this piece now!

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.260
How can I compete?

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:32.820
Ms. Zhuang always says

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.380
she sees her younger self in me.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.180
But we are

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.060
two different people.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.540
And I don't have your ability.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.860
I've seen Black Swan.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.100
What's so great about the Black Swan?

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.300
I don't want to be the Black Swan.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.540
For that one moment,

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:52.740
she paid with her life.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.780
Do you have to give your life for art?

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:57.700
It's not worth it.
