I, Li Yuanze,

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:55.520
request Your Majesty

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.520
to retry Liu Zhen's case

according to the law

and return justice
to the Grand Secretary.

He spent his whole life
contributing to the kingdom.

There must be
more to this than meets the eye.

to Your Majesty
to investigate this person thoroughly.

His Majesty is ill.

I will be the one making decisions
in the imperial court today.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.240
are you going

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.960
to make this imperial accusation?

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.159
Princess Royal,

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.039
please fulfill my wish.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.639

is accusing someone of a higher rank
and members of the royalty are involved,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.960

This is the Princess Royal's Residence.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:47.440
It's all thanks to General Gan,
whom all literary officials despise,

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:49.240
for defeating Beijiang

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.399

isn't it a joke for you

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.520
to make a royal accusation
at the imperial hall?

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:19.200
You killed my teacher

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.559
to get revenge?

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:26.600
Didn't he deserve to die?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.639
I was tortured for five years

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:30.600
and only stayed alive
because of my grudge!

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:33.600
All of this happened
because of Liu Zhen!

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:50.399
why do you

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:54.120
bring me here?

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:01.320
Naturally, I'm trying
to gather talented individuals.

00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:04.639
There might be a grudge between us,

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:08.039
but I've always
appreciated people with talent.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.679
Official Li, why don't you stay

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.279
and become a strategist
of Princess Royal's Residence?

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:15.960
What do you think?

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:27.039

Unfortunately,

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.679
I am foolish.

00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:40.120

point in one direction

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.580
and I won't give up no matter what.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.039
Li Yuanze,

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:58.679
I'll give you another chance.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.519
No matter how many chances you give me,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.559
it'll still be the same.

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:12.840
Fine.

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:14.879
I will fulfill your wish

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.879
