=Episode 23=

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:48.914
(Changxi Dumplings)
This is Li Ergou.

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:51.740
He stole money from the mine
and ran off.

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:54.259
Tuo's father was kindhearted.

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:55.580
He didn't pursue it.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.539
He took pity on the Li family's hardship

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.539
and brought Li Ergou's cousin home
to work as a nanny.

00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:03.332
So you think Li Ergou

00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:05.131
was Lin Xirou's original blood bag?

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:06.356
If that's true,

00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:08.636
then he's also Lin Ling's blood kin.

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.859
So Li Ergou's cousin is the one

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.459
who later became the nanny
at Yan Tuo's home?

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.299
Yes, it's her.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.220
Li Shuangxiu.

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:18.844
Later, because of her,

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:21.684
Tuo's family was torn apart.

00:02:25.315 --> 00:02:26.234
(Roadsound Mining)
I've looked everywhere.

00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:27.514
I didn't see Li Ergou.

00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:30.435
But I kept feeling
there was something else.

00:02:30.914 --> 00:02:31.595
Right.

00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:33.395
I felt like
something was watching me too.

00:02:34.074 --> 00:02:35.395
It was a ghost. Definitely.

00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:36.634
Maybe Li Ergou

00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:38.395
was snatched by that ghost.

00:02:39.794 --> 00:02:41.595
What nonsense are you two talking about?

00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:43.555
In such a big mining zone

00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:44.794
with so many men around,

00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:46.835
what ghost could there be?

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:50.738
Get back to work.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:51.979
I looked everywhere.

00:02:52.298 --> 00:02:53.778
I didn't see Li Ergou.

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:55.939
I sensed something.

00:02:56.298 --> 00:02:56.798
Changxi.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:57.939
What's going on?

00:02:58.419 --> 00:02:59.458
I'll go down to check.

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:01.659
Why are you butting in?

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:03.458
Your wife is pregnant.

00:03:03.778 --> 00:03:04.859
The checking job

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.259
shouldn't be your responsibility.

00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:08.810
Guys, if you ask me,

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:10.651
Li Ergou definitely

00:03:10.731 --> 00:03:11.851
stole the mine's money,

00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:13.402
(Time Is Life, Safety Is Efficiency)
and then, out of guilt,

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:15.651
he's hiding in the mine,
pretending to be a ghost.

00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:17.690
Soon, I'll drag him out.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.690
You can hit him or scold him
all you want.

00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:20.291
Okay?

00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.570
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.450
So no money-stealing Li Ergou,

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.771
but the charming Li Shuangxiu.

00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:42.130
Shouldn't a nanny be at his home,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.370
taking care of his family?

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.010
Why would he bring her to the mine?

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.211
You wouldn't understand.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.051
The office is quiet and cool.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.250
Makes sense.

00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:54.130
They have a boy and a girl.

00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:55.130
They're deeply in love.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.690
If you've got time to gossip,

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.490
why not find yourself a wife?

00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:00.571
Let's get back to work.

00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:01.730
Time to get back to work.

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.018
Madam.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.138
Madam.

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:10.939
Come on.

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.258
- Changxi.
- Pass Xinxin to me.

00:04:12.778 --> 00:04:14.258
Alright, thank you.

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.458
We're friends. No need to be so polite.

00:04:16.658 --> 00:04:17.499
Let's go upstairs.

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:19.979
Changxi.

00:04:24.658 --> 00:04:25.778
You're an honest man.

00:04:27.258 --> 00:04:28.898
Can you tell me the truth?

00:04:30.755 --> 00:04:32.714
Between Dashan and Li Shuangxiu,

00:04:33.515 --> 00:04:34.435
is there anything?

00:04:37.923 --> 00:04:39.284
What could possibly be there?

00:04:40.164 --> 00:04:40.844
Madam,

00:04:41.764 --> 00:04:43.404
just stop worrying so much.

00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:45.164
Take good care of the kids.

00:04:45.443 --> 00:04:47.883
Live a happy life with Shan.

00:04:51.811 --> 00:04:53.532
Let's go upstairs.

00:04:54.947 --> 00:04:56.307
Alright, let's go.

00:04:57.251 --> 00:05:00.011
Let's go.

00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:07.850
Move aside.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.850
Move.

00:05:22.915 --> 00:05:23.754
Madam.

00:05:25.794 --> 00:05:26.715
W-What happened?

00:05:27.155 --> 00:05:28.835
D-Dashan's phone is unreachable.

00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:31.275
I-I have no choice but to beg you.

00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:33.234
What...

00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:35.955
There's no escaping this.

00:05:36.915 --> 00:05:38.874
S-She... I...

00:05:41.434 --> 00:05:43.234
I-I'll turn myself in.

00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:47.091
Who did this?

00:05:47.091 --> 00:05:47.812
Dashan.

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:49.731
Dashan.

00:05:49.971 --> 00:05:50.651
I...

00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:53.452
We just had an argument.

00:05:55.651 --> 00:05:56.572
I lost control

00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:57.851
and pushed her.

00:05:57.971 --> 00:05:59.211
She lost her balance.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:00.252
And then...

00:06:01.572 --> 00:06:02.211
Dashan,

00:06:02.452 --> 00:06:05.091
I-I didn't mean it.

00:06:05.411 --> 00:06:06.851
It wasn't intentional.

00:06:07.651 --> 00:06:09.531
I-I really didn't mean to.

00:06:09.971 --> 00:06:10.692
Dashan.

00:06:11.611 --> 00:06:12.332
Alright.

00:06:12.515 --> 00:06:13.515
It was an accident.

00:06:13.515 --> 00:06:15.120
Alright.

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:16.555
It's okay.

00:06:16.635 --> 00:06:17.796
It's okay.

00:06:18.435 --> 00:06:19.995
Let me see.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.220
Both of you, go outside.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.060
We'll hide her first.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.259
If we can't hide her,

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.779
you two play dumb.

00:06:58.139 --> 00:06:58.979
You were at the mine.

00:07:00.163 --> 00:07:01.283
You took the kids out.

00:07:03.003 --> 00:07:03.643
Only she and I

00:07:07.523 --> 00:07:08.523
were here in the house.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:09.484
Shan,

00:07:10.403 --> 00:07:11.844
this won't work.

00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:12.643
Changxi,

00:07:13.027 --> 00:07:14.387
if you still see me as a brother,

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:15.828
this is decided.

00:07:16.948 --> 00:07:17.588
Get out.

00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:19.907
Dashan.

00:07:20.068 --> 00:07:20.747
Out!

00:07:21.468 --> 00:07:22.308
Dashan.

00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:22.948
Get out!

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:23.948
- Dashan.
- Get out!

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:49.580
Changxi,

00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:52.379
you saw it that day too.

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:54.019
Li Shuangxiu wasn't breathing.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.379
Right?

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.259
Shan, what's this about?

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.019
That day,

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.899
Xirou and I

00:08:09.795 --> 00:08:11.594
buried Li Shuangxiu in the mountains.

00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:15.235
Xirou was afraid I'd take the blame,

00:08:15.834 --> 00:08:16.995
so she turned herself in.

00:08:18.194 --> 00:08:19.635
The police dug for a whole day

00:08:20.035 --> 00:08:21.115
but found nothing.

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:24.779
They suspected Xirou
of filing a false report

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:27.340
and even claimed she's

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:29.180
mentally unstable.

00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:38.060
Changxi,

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:41.300
we both saw it too.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.259
Could it be

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:46.580
all three of us are mentally...

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:07.219
Mom.

00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:23.860
Mom.

00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:27.740
Mom.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.059
Where can you go with two kids?

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:34.059
We can't stay here any longer.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.700
I consulted the mine's electrician.

00:09:37.939 --> 00:09:39.460
After an electric shock,

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:41.220
the victim might go into shock.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.299
They can appear lifeless.

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:45.899
At that time,

00:09:47.259 --> 00:09:49.100
we simply panicked.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.419
I couldn't risk the kids' safety.

00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:55.820
It's not that bad.

00:09:57.019 --> 00:09:58.820
Li Shuangxiu is fine now, isn't she?

00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:01.740
If you're afraid she'll extort you,

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.980
apologize and pay her if needed.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.820
This is your and Dashan's home.

00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:09.100
Where could you possibly go?

00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:17.659
Everything you're saying

00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:20.299
relies on one condition.

00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:23.259
She is human.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.139
What?

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.380
Li Shuangxiu

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.820
has latched onto our family.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.820
Afterward,

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.100
Tuo's mother forbade me from visiting.

00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:52.100
I only knew

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.059
she and the kids

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.500
could never escape Youtang.

00:10:58.779 --> 00:11:00.820
Later, I saw her at the hospital,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.700
unrecognizably emaciated.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.580
She said

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.179
Li Shuangxiu forced
Tuo's father to draft a will,

00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:09.419
demanding all family assets
and the mines

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.779
be left solely to her.

00:11:11.539 --> 00:11:13.019
I called it absurd.

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:15.059
But Ms. Lin said

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.299
Li Shuangxiu held Tuo hostage.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.299
So they were powerless.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.299
Shortly after that,

00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:22.340
Tuo's father passed away.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.179
To me,

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:29.299
it's never truly faded.

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:31.820
He was so young

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.100
and died in an instant.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.539
Only if he died

00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:45.620
would the will take effect.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.259
Though it's their family matter

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:54.179
and I shouldn't speculate

00:11:54.299 --> 00:11:55.340
or say unfounded things,

00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:58.340
Tuo's mother seemed
to have a premonition.

00:11:58.899 --> 00:12:00.100
She mailed me a package

00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:02.700
containing her diary
from over the years.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.620
She said if anything happened to her,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.340
once Tuo grew up,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.820
I should give him the diary.

00:12:09.139 --> 00:12:10.419
When exactly did you

00:12:10.419 --> 00:12:11.779
give Yan Tuo the diary?

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:13.620
I waited until he entered university,

00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:15.580
believing he'd matured enough

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.939
to handle that.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.100
Then I gave it to him.

00:12:25.539 --> 00:12:27.419
Normally, I should disclose

00:12:28.659 --> 00:12:30.259
Tuo's privacy to you.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.139
But I believe

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.139
Tuo considers you two family.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.220
Despite his cheerful demeanor,

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.059
he's gone through a lot.

00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:56.683
(Antique and Jade Store)

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.620
Xiong, this is the place.

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:07.539
Xiong.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.019
Go!

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.419
Go upstairs!

00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:25.980
Hurry!

00:13:41.483 --> 00:13:42.779
(Changxi Dumplings)

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:43.939
It's the New Year holidays.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.980
You don't even enjoy a peaceful break?

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.899
If your hometown relatives knew

00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:50.340
you got beaten up out here,

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.820
they'd look down on you.

00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:03.059
Get her.

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:11.860
What's happening?

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.019
Mr. Changxi,

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.380
I don't have time to explain.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.220
Lock the door.

00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:16.259
I'll be back soon.

00:14:18.019 --> 00:14:18.580
Don't worry.

00:14:30.059 --> 00:14:34.283
(Changxi Dumplings)

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:29.659
Move aside.

00:15:30.659 --> 00:15:31.340
Sit here.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.179
Mr. Changxi, what should we do?

00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:40.659
I left my phone downstairs.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.540
Watch out!

00:19:20.547 --> 00:19:21.067
Let's go.

00:19:22.307 --> 00:19:22.827
Let's go.

00:19:23.706 --> 00:19:24.347
Move.

00:19:49.747 --> 00:19:50.946
Big Head and Shan Qiang

00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:53.932
located two abandoned
Roadsound mine sites.

00:19:54.172 --> 00:19:55.732
Both have traces of human activity.

00:19:57.172 --> 00:19:58.411
One is at Chishan.

00:19:59.091 --> 00:20:00.131
The other is at Youtang.

00:20:06.732 --> 00:20:08.452
You take people to Chishan.

00:20:08.452 --> 00:20:10.172
For Youtang,
Yu Rong and I will handle it.

00:20:12.331 --> 00:20:12.972
Luo,

00:20:13.772 --> 00:20:15.292
I was eager to rescue Jiang earlier.

00:20:16.532 --> 00:20:18.492
And I didn't want
the South Mountain buddies

00:20:18.732 --> 00:20:20.292
to shoulder any risk.

00:20:21.492 --> 00:20:22.851
Regarding Yan Tuo,

00:20:23.732 --> 00:20:24.692
it was my fault.

00:20:26.492 --> 00:20:27.651
You don't need to explain.

00:20:27.932 --> 00:20:29.532
These words mean nothing to me now.

00:20:37.492 --> 00:20:38.891
I've never doubted

00:20:38.891 --> 00:20:40.851
your loyalty
to South Mountain and Jiang.

00:20:41.692 --> 00:20:42.532
I don't expect you

00:20:42.532 --> 00:20:44.411
to accept or understand Yan Tuo.

00:20:44.891 --> 00:20:45.492
I simply hope

00:20:45.492 --> 00:20:47.331
that if you ever see him again,

00:20:48.212 --> 00:20:49.772
you'll show him proper respect.

00:20:51.411 --> 00:20:51.911
Okay.

00:20:52.972 --> 00:20:53.811
I will.

00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:57.571
I should go to Youtang with you.

00:21:05.571 --> 00:21:07.172
Rejecting you isn't stubbornness.

00:21:09.051 --> 00:21:10.651
More crucial tasks need you.

00:21:35.492 --> 00:21:36.252
Mr. Changxi.

00:21:41.851 --> 00:21:43.051
Still, the new year

00:21:44.091 --> 00:21:44.891
must be celebrated.

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:47.272
Come on.

00:21:49.411 --> 00:21:50.331
Put up these couplets.

00:21:57.371 --> 00:21:58.571
I'm sorry, Mr. Changxi.

00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:00.611
You and Lin Ling

00:22:01.212 --> 00:22:03.051
can't stay here any longer.

00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:04.972
You both must come with me.

00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:10.452
As long as it eases
your and Tuo's burden,

00:22:10.611 --> 00:22:11.571
I'll go wherever needed.

00:22:12.411 --> 00:22:13.252
Just say it.

00:22:15.452 --> 00:22:17.411
Aren't you going to ask why?

00:22:19.811 --> 00:22:22.932
When Tuo entrusted you two to me,

00:22:22.932 --> 00:22:24.172
I was already prepared.

00:22:25.172 --> 00:22:26.012
As I always say,

00:22:26.452 --> 00:22:28.532
if you don't speak of it, I won't pry.

00:22:32.212 --> 00:22:33.411
Rest assured, Mr. Changxi.

00:22:34.051 --> 00:22:34.972
The dumpling restaurant

00:22:34.972 --> 00:22:36.732
will be fully renovated for you.

00:22:38.212 --> 00:22:39.091
For the New Year,

00:22:39.532 --> 00:22:41.811
broken things
symbolize safety and peace.

00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:44.811
These old tables and chairs

00:22:45.051 --> 00:22:46.571
just need to be replaced.

00:22:47.492 --> 00:22:48.532
When Tuo returns,

00:22:49.012 --> 00:22:50.972
I'll have him replace them
with new ones.

00:22:55.292 --> 00:22:56.571
He'll be back soon.

00:23:07.875 --> 00:23:08.516
Ms. Lu.

00:23:08.867 --> 00:23:09.748
Miss Nie, you're back.

00:23:09.748 --> 00:23:10.308
Come on in.

00:23:11.988 --> 00:23:12.748
Hello.

00:23:13.228 --> 00:23:13.728
Hello.

00:23:15.827 --> 00:23:16.468
Ms. Lu,

00:23:16.788 --> 00:23:18.308
they're Yan Tuo's uncle and cousin.

00:23:18.427 --> 00:23:20.268
They'll stay with us for a while.

00:23:21.387 --> 00:23:23.028
Lin Ling and Mr. Changxi,

00:23:23.187 --> 00:23:24.948
tell Ms. Lu anything you need.

00:23:25.028 --> 00:23:26.163
Make yourselves at home.

00:23:28.827 --> 00:23:29.667
You are?

00:23:30.187 --> 00:23:31.308
Liu Changxi.

00:23:32.347 --> 00:23:34.387
Did you enjoy the dumplings last time?

00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:37.107
So it really was you.

00:23:39.548 --> 00:23:40.107
Okay.

00:23:41.587 --> 00:23:42.387
Hello, Ms. Lu.

00:23:42.548 --> 00:23:43.708
Just call me Lin Ling.

00:23:44.508 --> 00:23:45.667
Hello, Miss Lin Ling.

00:23:47.508 --> 00:23:49.708
Your father's dumplings
were very delicious.

00:23:50.147 --> 00:23:51.587
Those dumplings last time

00:23:51.867 --> 00:23:52.948
didn't last long with me.

00:23:52.948 --> 00:23:53.988
You misunderstood.

00:23:54.667 --> 00:23:55.988
I'm an old bachelor.

00:23:56.187 --> 00:23:57.748
I don't have such a pretty daughter.

00:23:58.788 --> 00:23:59.667
I misunderstood.

00:23:59.667 --> 00:24:00.167
Yes.

00:24:00.708 --> 00:24:01.627
It's fine, Ms. Lu.

00:24:01.748 --> 00:24:03.308
You'll get to know each other later.

00:24:03.468 --> 00:24:04.708
Show them the guest rooms.

00:24:04.948 --> 00:24:06.427
I'll be away for a few days.

00:24:06.627 --> 00:24:07.948
Take good care of them.

00:24:08.347 --> 00:24:09.468
Okay, don't worry.

00:24:09.788 --> 00:24:10.427
Give me that.

00:24:10.427 --> 00:24:11.268
I can do it.

00:24:11.268 --> 00:24:11.867
Let's go.

00:24:12.068 --> 00:24:13.187
This way, please.

00:24:14.147 --> 00:24:14.867
Mr. Changxi.

00:24:39.708 --> 00:24:41.107
Nuwa holds the compass.

00:24:41.308 --> 00:24:42.587
Fuxi grasps the square.

00:24:43.508 --> 00:24:44.708
Without rules,

00:24:45.387 --> 00:24:46.627
there's no order.

00:25:02.627 --> 00:25:03.827
Being Mad Blade

00:25:04.627 --> 00:25:06.347
in secret for all these years,

00:25:06.547 --> 00:25:08.186
was revealing yourself to an outsider

00:25:08.706 --> 00:25:09.307
truly worth it?

00:25:13.186 --> 00:25:14.466
It wasn't just for him.

00:25:14.907 --> 00:25:15.986
It was also for Jiang.

00:25:16.706 --> 00:25:17.426
Besides,

00:25:18.387 --> 00:25:19.466
Yan Tuo is not an outsider.

00:25:20.355 --> 00:25:20.996
Alright.

00:25:21.355 --> 00:25:22.196
Alright.

00:25:23.196 --> 00:25:24.956
Then let me tell you a story.

00:25:26.315 --> 00:25:28.395
Remember when we couldn't figure it out?

00:25:28.756 --> 00:25:29.835
Since Li Ergou

00:25:29.835 --> 00:25:31.835
was Lin Xirou's first blood bag,

00:25:32.676 --> 00:25:34.756
how did Lin Ling come about?

00:25:35.716 --> 00:25:38.036
Xing Shen
had her background investigated.

00:25:38.516 --> 00:25:41.595
Li Ergou, who disappeared
from Roadsound Mining back then...

00:25:42.155 --> 00:25:43.835
He was actually Lin Ling's close kin.

00:25:51.916 --> 00:25:53.476
Lin Ling and I saw Li Ergou's photo

00:25:53.476 --> 00:25:54.956
at Mr. Changxi's place.

00:25:56.276 --> 00:25:58.555
I thought Lin Ling
acted strangely back then.

00:25:59.595 --> 00:26:00.476
It felt like

00:26:01.875 --> 00:26:03.996
she could sense something.

00:26:07.956 --> 00:26:10.196
When Lin Xirou first gained footing,

00:26:10.196 --> 00:26:11.956
she tracked down Li Ergou's parents.

00:26:12.875 --> 00:26:14.155
She offered them a fortune

00:26:15.075 --> 00:26:16.516
to have another child.

00:26:17.595 --> 00:26:20.315
She said regardless
of gender or quantity,

00:26:20.795 --> 00:26:21.875
if they had more children,

00:26:22.155 --> 00:26:23.196
she'd take them all.

00:26:24.555 --> 00:26:26.555
Li Ergou's parents had already divorced,

00:26:26.555 --> 00:26:28.516
but moved back together for the money.

00:26:35.436 --> 00:26:36.916
So Li Ergou was actually

00:26:37.196 --> 00:26:38.436
Lin Ling's brother.

00:26:39.635 --> 00:26:42.036
So, to maintain her blood bag supply,

00:26:42.355 --> 00:26:44.875
Lin Xirou paid Li Ergou's parents
to keep having children.

00:26:45.716 --> 00:26:47.075
How many more did they have?

00:26:47.315 --> 00:26:48.276
Just Lin Ling.

00:26:48.996 --> 00:26:50.555
Later, they fought over the money

00:26:50.956 --> 00:26:52.875
and died together in a car crash.

00:26:56.875 --> 00:26:58.595
Lin Ling's existence in this world

00:26:59.115 --> 00:27:00.196
was just a transaction,

00:27:01.795 --> 00:27:04.436
a tool purchased by Lin Xirou

00:27:05.516 --> 00:27:06.676
to breed more blood bags.

00:27:07.795 --> 00:27:08.956
Out of a family of four,

00:27:09.555 --> 00:27:11.115
only a tool survived.

00:27:12.355 --> 00:27:13.795
Not sure whether to feel relieved

00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:15.676
or sorrowful about it.

00:27:17.676 --> 00:27:18.676
Yan Tuo once said

00:27:19.355 --> 00:27:20.395
those kept in the dark

00:27:20.756 --> 00:27:21.956
live more carefree lives.

00:27:23.516 --> 00:27:24.395
Let these matters

00:27:24.756 --> 00:27:26.075
stay buried within us.

00:28:10.555 --> 00:28:12.635
Big Head

00:28:13.315 --> 00:28:15.155
got guarding down.

00:28:15.155 --> 00:28:15.916
Shut up.

00:28:16.476 --> 00:28:18.155
Others have guard dogs,

00:28:18.395 --> 00:28:19.916
and I have Big Head.

00:28:20.155 --> 00:28:21.155
Enough already.

00:28:21.155 --> 00:28:22.875
I said shut up.

00:28:26.555 --> 00:28:27.115
My beard.

00:28:37.516 --> 00:28:38.555
We've received reports

00:28:39.355 --> 00:28:41.436
of suspicious activity
near this location.

00:28:41.916 --> 00:28:42.996
We'll inspect the area.

00:28:45.355 --> 00:28:46.716
The mine's long been abandoned.

00:28:46.956 --> 00:28:48.355
There's no suspicious activity.

00:28:48.756 --> 00:28:50.236
Look at us.

00:28:50.236 --> 00:28:51.395
Do we look suspicious?

00:28:51.395 --> 00:28:52.115
Actually, yes.

00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:53.795
Why hang around an abandoned mine?

00:28:54.115 --> 00:28:54.996
Illegal mining?

00:28:55.595 --> 00:28:57.436
Illegal mining's a criminal offense.

00:28:57.436 --> 00:28:58.276
We'd never do that.

00:28:58.676 --> 00:28:59.355
We're here

00:28:59.355 --> 00:29:00.635
just because the boss sent us

00:29:00.635 --> 00:29:01.795
to watch the equipment.

00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:03.476
There are zero workers here.

00:29:03.756 --> 00:29:04.835
What could we possibly dig?

00:29:04.996 --> 00:29:06.236
No one at all?

00:29:07.196 --> 00:29:07.996
No.

00:29:10.996 --> 00:29:11.795
Show us.

00:29:11.795 --> 00:29:12.555
Wait a second.

00:29:13.355 --> 00:29:14.036
Gentlemen,

00:29:14.756 --> 00:29:16.716
there's no problem with looking around,

00:29:17.115 --> 00:29:20.756
but which department are you from?

00:29:21.476 --> 00:29:23.555
Please show your IDs if possible,

00:29:24.075 --> 00:29:25.476
so I can report to my boss.

00:29:25.476 --> 00:29:26.036
Right?

00:29:35.555 --> 00:29:38.315
Xicang Mining Safety Administration,
Liu Zhengming?

00:29:57.635 --> 00:29:58.555
The area is clear.

00:29:59.476 --> 00:30:00.036
Coming.

00:30:07.379 --> 00:30:10.803
(613, Youtang County)

00:30:29.795 --> 00:30:30.756
This place is huge.

00:30:30.835 --> 00:30:31.956
Let's split up.

00:30:32.996 --> 00:30:34.996
Okay, keep in touch.

00:30:34.996 --> 00:30:35.956
- Got it.
- Got it.

00:30:46.995 --> 00:30:48.947
(Helmet Required in Mining Area)

00:31:58.963 --> 00:32:02.451
(Turn of the Century, Yan Family)

00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:09.858
Any findings?

00:32:10.579 --> 00:32:12.378
(Roadsound Mining)
No obvious leads left.

00:32:12.898 --> 00:32:13.779
We can enter the mine.

00:32:17.827 --> 00:32:18.827
The keyhole's clean.

00:32:19.106 --> 00:32:20.387
Regular access likely.

00:32:22.827 --> 00:32:23.907
They talked.

00:32:23.907 --> 00:32:25.546
Lin Xirou and her followers

00:32:25.546 --> 00:32:26.546
come regularly.

00:32:26.546 --> 00:32:27.106
Copy that.

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.706
I'll go down with Yu Rong.

00:32:30.186 --> 00:32:31.467
You and Big Head wait outside.

00:32:31.555 --> 00:32:32.356
Can you do that?

00:32:32.436 --> 00:32:32.936
Perhaps...

00:32:39.996 --> 00:32:42.075
We just found these
in the security department.

00:32:59.971 --> 00:33:00.971
(Security Department)
Which one is it?

00:33:02.252 --> 00:33:04.172
The one
with the girl group profile picture.

00:33:04.172 --> 00:33:06.772
(Xiong Black)

00:33:06.772 --> 00:33:09.732
Xiong Bu... Bu Lai Ke?

00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:12.252
Black. It's English.

00:33:12.652 --> 00:33:13.252
What's that?

00:33:14.531 --> 00:33:16.332
The English word for 'Hei.'

00:33:16.772 --> 00:33:17.451
Hei?

00:33:18.692 --> 00:33:19.812
So, it's Xiong Hei?

00:33:19.971 --> 00:33:20.851
Right.

00:33:21.155 --> 00:33:22.195
Xiong Black.

00:33:22.874 --> 00:33:24.035
That's quite fancy.

00:33:42.314 --> 00:33:42.954
Ms. Lin,

00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:44.874
these are new blood bags for You Peng.

00:33:44.995 --> 00:33:45.794
Please pick one.

00:33:47.354 --> 00:33:48.394
They're all healthy

00:33:48.754 --> 00:33:50.075
with simple social connections.

00:33:51.155 --> 00:33:52.954
If they go missing,
no one will look for them.

00:33:54.834 --> 00:33:56.155
How about the mine?

00:33:56.754 --> 00:33:58.578
Just got an update. All is well.

00:33:58.578 --> 00:33:59.986
(Personnel Reserve, Zhou Bingyu)

00:34:01.874 --> 00:34:04.594
(Sun Minjie, Wang Yuehai)

00:34:06.322 --> 00:34:07.602
(Sun Minjie)
Let's go with this one.

00:34:08.075 --> 00:34:09.314
You Peng has a large build.

00:34:09.715 --> 00:34:11.035
Let's pick a big guy for him.

00:34:11.914 --> 00:34:12.715
Right on it.

00:34:13.394 --> 00:34:14.794
When You Peng is transformed,

00:34:14.794 --> 00:34:16.195
he will definitely be useful.

00:34:16.834 --> 00:34:17.555
Go do your work.

00:34:17.595 --> 00:34:18.155
Okay.

00:35:07.139 --> 00:35:09.460
If this place
is really Lin Xirou's lair,

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.139
what's below

00:35:11.699 --> 00:35:12.860
is hard to say.

00:35:14.699 --> 00:35:16.099
If you're not ready yet,

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.300
I can go down alone.

00:36:59.939 --> 00:37:00.771
Luo.

00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:03.075
