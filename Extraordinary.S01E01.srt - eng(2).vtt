00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.759
Do you believe in parallel universes?

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.240
Me, in this universe,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.040
am well-read, a science nerd.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.480
No connections, all self-made.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.319
Struggling daily, hustling for life.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.719
Don't spit on my book.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:11.480
This... this is all I have.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.799
This is everything I own.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:14.480
Spit over here.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.319
Look at you, so shabby.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.640
Me, in another universe,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.719
indulges in pleasure, stubborn and useless.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.239
Short on luck, not on money.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:24.640
Living in fear, unsure of life or death.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.879
Shi Feifan.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.760
Prepare to die!

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.200
Get lost!

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.120
Until one moment,

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:43.439
when time and fate collide.

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.439
One dies, but the soul remains.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:49.120
One revives, stronger in will.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.719
Retreat.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.439
Life is a play,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.680
even if the stage changes,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.599
you still have to act your part.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.800
Duke of Nan.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.199
Young Duke, he... he's awake!

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.000
Son, you're awake!

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.919
Feifan!

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:41.879
Call me your son.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.479
Quick, tell me.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.000
Duke of Nan.

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.159
How are you feeling?

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.560
I...

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.240
Wasn't I hit by a car?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.039
Hit by a car? What?

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.800
Yesterday, you were attacked by this assassin.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.240
Yesterday, you were attacked by this assassin.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.960
You almost lost your life.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.280
Father.

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:55.639
I'm fine.

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.800
Glad you're okay.

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:59.680
Assassinated...

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.199
I've been reborn.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:03.680
Son...

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.199
Did you see who attacked you last night?

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.520
Some say a miracle happened, like a god possessed you.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.560
Nonsense.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.240
Only by killing his useless son

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.199
can I get the Tiger Tally.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.199
Tell your men to keep watch.

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.879
No mistakes next time.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.919
Celestial Star Tower.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.000
Right.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.560
I investigated this before.

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:37.159
Duke of Nan sent me.

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.599
I haven't reported back yet.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.520
This is all I could find.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:44.599
Rumors in the martial world say

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.520
Celestial Star Tower works for money.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.840
Anyone who's met them in the past ten years

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.039
hasn't lived to tell the tale.

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.360
You're the exception.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.439
Celestial Star Tower... Young Duke.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.360
I really did transmigrate.

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:57.560
Dare to assassinate me?

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.639
Interesting.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.960
Shi Xiaofan.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.919
Let Shi Feifan reshape your life here.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.400
My life is mine to command, not heaven's to decree.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.360
I heard the capital's top playboy,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.879
Young Duke Shi won't live long.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:20.800
So why is Duke of Nan

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.120
still hiring servants now?

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.040
Who cares?

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:24.360
As long as there's money.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:25.360
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.160
I volunteered to sneak into Shi Manor for my royal brother.

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.079
So it seems

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.360
Shi Feifan won't last long.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.240
It's the perfect time to look for the Tiger Tally.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.480
I... I...

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:40.879
Wait, just wait.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.519
I...

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.279
Don't push.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.519
I... I... Line up!

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:45.040
How can you manage with that tiny frame?

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.399
Move aside, move aside.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.759
Don't push, don't push.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.399
One at a time.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.600
Line up.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:52.399
I'm young.

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:53.839
Hurry, you, come here.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.199
Looks like I need another plan.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:58.480
Young Duke.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.720
Duke of Nan won't let us out.

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:01.480
What if you run into danger outside?

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.519
How is he still alive?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.480
Young... Young Duke, no...

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:07.800
Young Duke, I'm not messing with you.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.959
Who'd dare attack in broad daylight?

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.800
Young Duke, please take me in.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:11.519
Go, hurry up!

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.240
Young Duke.

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.800
Young Duke.

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:18.600
If you don't take me in, I'd rather...

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.480
Why are you shouting?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.319
What did you say?

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.079
If I let go, don't scream, okay?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.959
My name is Mei Zhenlong.

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:30.480
Not "Zhengrong."

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:33.319
It's "Long," not "Rong."

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.639
Mei as in plum blossom, Zhen as in real,

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:38.600
Long as in dragon.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:40.720
That's a unique name.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.879
Alright, got it.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.839
Young Duke.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.600
You don't...

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:46.160
Alright, alright.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.319
Stay, stay, stay.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.600
No more shouting, got it?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.079
Let me go.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:53.199
I...

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.000
Safe.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.360
So dirty.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.040
Take her back to change clothes.

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:01.319
Filthy—hurts our Duke's reputation.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.199
Alright, alright.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.879
What are you doing?

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:04.959
Come on, let's go change.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.519
Still holding me?

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.319
Go, go, go.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.079
Young Duke.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.000
Let's go.

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:20.000
Young Duke.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.879
He really let her stay.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.519
She looks like my friend who sells books.

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.120
She's quite pitiful.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.800
You have such poor friends?

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.600
Do I judge friends by wealth?

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.519
Your biggest hobby before

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:40.480
was living carefree.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.519
Spending money like water.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:42.560
Everyone who met you...

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.480
This girl looks familiar.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.600
Young Duke, you really joke around.

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:50.480
Isn't that Ziyan?

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.680
The maid next to her.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.959
Her name is Xiaocui.

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:56.319
Ziyan.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.600
I never thought he'd be the first since
Celestial Star Tower was founded

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:13.279
to slip through our net.

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:14.399
I have failed in my duty.

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:19.680
Yueying,

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:22.959
Celestial Star Tower trained you

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:26.879
not for you to dance and sing here
in Cangxiang Pavilion.

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:29.439
You must always remember

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.240
you belong to Celestial Star Tower.

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:34.519
Yes.

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:43.439
If Duke of Nan killed your family,

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.879
he's an enemy of our entire Tower.

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:51.279
Go ahead, don't hesitate.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.439
Of course I want him cut to pieces.

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:55.720
But after the last fight,

00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:58.959
acting in secret is safer.

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:05.240
I've raised silkworms all my life,

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:07.959
never seen such a low price.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.839
Ask around if you want,

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:11.439
that's the market price.

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:13.480
The higher-ups said

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.759
it all ends tomorrow.

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:15.920
If you don't sell today,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.240
tomorrow you won't get even half.

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:19.920
Fine, fine.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.000
I'll sell to you then.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.879
That's more like it.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:22.800
Young Duke,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.800
they buy cocoons so cheap,

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.160
but sell silk so expensive.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.040
Isn't that cheating honest folks?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.879
They're milking both ends of the deal.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.039
Silk cloth...

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.279
Here's our chance.

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:44.000
Careful.

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:52.360
Let's go, let's go.

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:52.960
Alright.

00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:54.240
Young Duke,

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:55.519
looks like

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:58.440
even broad daylight isn't safe.

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:03.480
No one is allowed to live, no matter who.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.320
They're forcing me to fight for real.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.200
You want to fight on the road, huh?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.440
Fine.

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:14.600
Father,

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.639
what's troubling you?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.000
This month's army rations are covered,

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:25.679
but next month will be tough.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.600
No money? Then make some.

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:30.159
Make income?

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.360
Create revenue.

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:34.000
You know how to earn money?

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:35.879
Scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants—

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:37.440
merchants are the lowest.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.879
I'll use the lowest, merchant ways

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:41.759
to show His Majesty

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.360
Duke of Nan's house has no interest in politics.

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:45.519
At the same time,

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:48.679
I can help you with the army pay.

00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:50.080
No, that's not right.

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:52.759
This is a serious matter.

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:54.639
We must think it over carefully.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.480
Besides, at this time every year,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.559
Qiang Country sends envoys.

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:02.360
Now's not the time for trouble.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:04.600
Why does Qiang Country send people?

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:08.080
You don't care about court affairs,

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:09.039
so you wouldn't know.

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:11.720
Since the Founding Emperor lost,

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:14.519
our dynasty must send Qiang Country

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.840
a tribute of silk every year.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.960
Tribute.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.759
Looks like a huge opportunity.

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:41.279
Shi Feifan's little sidekick.

00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:47.159
Tiger Tally.

00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:49.399
Such an important item

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:52.080
must be where Duke of Nan stays most.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.399
Who?

00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:09.279
Stop!

00:11:14.919 --> 00:11:16.720
D-Duke of Nan...

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.799
What are you sneaking around for?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.799
To answer you, Duke of Nan,

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:23.840
what are you doing here?

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.440
Brother Ping'an sent me to get you food.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:30.679
I'm new here, don't know the way.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:35.840
That way.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.440
Son,

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:47.960
this person is suspicious.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.840
You still want to keep him?

00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:52.720
We don't know his true intent yet.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.879
Besides, we're short-handed.

00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:56.399
Let him stay for now.

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.720
Your mother's memorial is in a few days.

00:12:01.919 --> 00:12:02.480
Father,

00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:04.240
let me go with you to honor her.

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:07.039
It's a long journey.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.879
You should stay at home.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.200
Don't leave the estate.

00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:11.759
Just in case.

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:14.320
I was just worrying how to send you off.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.279
I'll do as you say.

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:17.679
Alright.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.919
Father, let's hurry on our way.

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:30.960
Be careful on the road.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.360
I'll be here at home

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.919
waiting for your safe return.
