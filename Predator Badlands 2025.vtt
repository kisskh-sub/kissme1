02:39.190 --> 02:43.010
I sense you, brother.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.710
Hiding...

02:52.700 --> 02:55.080
...Behind your cloak.

02:57.150 --> 02:59.150
It is time to earn yours.

03:11.070 --> 03:12.510
Still too small to take me head on.

03:13.370 --> 03:14.370
Use the cave!

03:29.010 --> 03:30.440
You fight with rage.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.220
I fight like father.

03:33.820 --> 03:36.220
You are not father, you are Dek!

04:29.800 --> 04:31.160
Do you yield?

04:31.430 --> 04:32.500
Never!

04:33.230 --> 04:34.420
Good.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.060
I'm still alive, brother.

05:07.450 --> 05:10.350
Still much to prove...

05:10.360 --> 05:12.940
...to show who you are.

05:13.370 --> 05:15.880
I am Yautja.

05:17.390 --> 05:19.690
Not yet.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.200
Are you holding your sword, Kwei?

05:25.290 --> 05:27.170
No.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.250
Pick it up!

05:57.900 --> 06:00.520
You kept this toy?!

06:00.700 --> 06:03.500
You remember what happened...

06:04.510 --> 06:06.710
I lost my fang!

06:08.400 --> 06:11.180
And you saved my life.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.320
You protected me.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.380
Come here.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.610
Fixed it for you.

06:30.700 --> 06:32.900
Don't blow yourself up.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.530
Today you make a vow...

06:51.290 --> 06:54.420
...as our ancestors did before you.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.950
To earn your place in the clan...

06:58.500 --> 07:01.450
...you must choose your prey.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.380
Bring it home...

07:05.600 --> 07:08.250
...or never return.

07:15.540 --> 07:17.740
Wait — Go back!

07:21.900 --> 07:23.490
Genna.

07:23.700 --> 07:26.430
The death planet.

07:27.100 --> 07:30.860
Home of the un-killable Kalisk.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Even father fears it.

07:38.340 --> 07:41.340
Then the Kalisk shall be my trophy.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.800
Father calls me the weakest...

07:45.600 --> 07:48.900
...so I must kill the strongest.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.620
Failure means death.

07:54.350 --> 07:57.430
Then I will not fail.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.540
I cannot allow it.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.660
I make my vow.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.300
I make my vow!

09:06.400 --> 09:07.850
Father.

09:08.770 --> 09:11.660
I welcome you with honor.

09:24.190 --> 09:27.280
Why is it not done?

09:27.890 --> 09:30.600
He deserves a hunt.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.910
He is our clan's weakness....

09:36.740 --> 09:39.370
...weaknesses must be culled.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.230
He will bring home the Kalisk.

09:45.220 --> 09:46.860
Foolishness.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.860
He is a runt.

09:49.360 --> 09:53.260
You should have done it as he slept.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.120
Kill him!

09:55.960 --> 09:57.180
Now!

10:07.240 --> 10:09.640
He will only honor us in death.

10:25.870 --> 10:27.130
Father.

10:39.590 --> 10:41.050
Kwei?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.410
Be brave, brother.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.520
Father!

11:46.000 --> 11:47.060
Kwei!!!

12:00.400 --> 12:03.390
To forgive weakness...

12:04.900 --> 12:08.030
...is to show weakness.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.230
No! Father, no!

12:19.300 --> 12:21.030
Get your sword!

12:24.100 --> 12:25.680
Kwei!!!

12:38.700 --> 12:41.840
<i>Launch sequence initiated.</i>

12:51.550 --> 12:54.190
Bring it home.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.730
Bring it home.

16:00.750 --> 16:03.350
For Kwei.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.980
Yautja!

23:01.110 --> 23:03.900
Yautja hunt alone.

25:28.860 --> 25:32.150
What happened to your legs?

26:19.350 --> 26:21.650
You have you seen the Kalisk?

27:10.110 --> 27:11.970
Useful...

27:11.990 --> 27:13.760
...like tool?

27:33.870 --> 27:36.090
I will use you, tool.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.310
Don't want flies.

29:26.340 --> 29:28.850
Name is Dek.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.100
Now talk that way.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.940
How long have you been here?

30:29.640 --> 30:32.160
Who would come?

30:46.360 --> 30:49.160
Sensitivity is weakness.

33:54.420 --> 33:56.220
I must eat.

34:09.230 --> 34:11.030
What is this creature?

34:17.120 --> 34:20.380
Then it will be my food, too.

34:29.050 --> 34:31.179
Quiet tool!

34:44.540 --> 34:46.770
You give up too easily.

37:29.070 --> 37:30.040
Kalisk?

38:44.800 --> 38:46.580
You give up too easily.

41:10.100 --> 41:13.620
When I pierced its head with my sword

41:14.270 --> 41:17.730
and its blood rushed down my face.

41:35.800 --> 41:38.050
This flesh is not sweet.

42:07.840 --> 42:10.180
I have no clan!

42:14.380 --> 42:16.780
No clan.

42:22.490 --> 42:25.430
I had a brother.

42:33.390 --> 42:36.840
Father killed him.

42:42.820 --> 42:45.150
Grief is weakness.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.780
I am here for Kalisk.

42:57.460 --> 43:00.170
Why are you here?

43:15.010 --> 43:18.340
You should be able to survive on your own.

43:30.570 --> 43:33.550
Tessa is your sister.

44:04.120 --> 44:05.540
And legs.

44:08.890 --> 44:10.600
Finding your sister

44:11.540 --> 44:13.100
And legs.

47:32.450 --> 47:33.390
The sun rises.

47:33.780 --> 47:35.270
Let's go.

47:43.200 --> 47:45.960
Yautja hunt alone.

47:50.900 --> 47:53.000
You're a tool.

48:02.600 --> 48:06.520
We're not in the tree now.

49:01.730 --> 49:03.740
Kalisk?

49:09.200 --> 49:11.200
It drinks here.

49:13.460 --> 49:15.360
It drinks here?

49:18.700 --> 49:21.030
You are a useless tool if you don't speak.

49:49.400 --> 49:52.130
My brother was protecting me.

49:57.500 --> 49:59.990
The clan can have no weakness.

50:02.060 --> 50:04.290
I will show them strength.

50:29.940 --> 50:31.620
Wolf

50:31.710 --> 50:34.700
This alpha must be a great killer.

50:35.220 --> 50:37.240
I will hunt it too.

50:50.740 --> 50:52.260
I see...

50:54.660 --> 50:59.060
But I will be the alpha that kills the most.

51:33.490 --> 51:35.430
The Kalish's den?

52:03.660 --> 52:05.660
Who are they?

53:03.970 --> 53:06.030
Easier to walk now.

53:08.770 --> 53:09.540
No.

53:10.030 --> 53:12.260
Easier for me to walk now.

53:28.550 --> 53:30.690
I too will remember this...

53:31.600 --> 53:35.640
...today I become Dek of the Yautja.

53:36.180 --> 53:38.730
I will honor Kwei...

53:40.540 --> 53:43.680
When I bring the Kalisk home.

53:45.930 --> 53:48.840
Then I take revenge.

53:50.700 --> 53:54.420
You will be the first to see my trophy.

53:56.030 --> 53:58.070
It is a great honor.

53:58.870 --> 54:00.470
For you.

54:10.930 --> 54:11.770
What?

54:17.000 --> 54:19.450
I came here for the Kalisk.

54:27.850 --> 54:30.030
You want my trophy.

54:33.700 --> 54:35.800
Where is the Kalisk?

54:40.400 --> 54:44.450
I use you, tool. You do not use me!

54:49.950 --> 54:51.750
I use you!

54:54.500 --> 54:57.000
Where is the Kalisk?

55:06.400 --> 55:10.360
Then my death will be honorable.

55:16.200 --> 55:18.160
Call your sister.

55:19.100 --> 55:21.200
None can stop me.

58:46.900 --> 58:48.900
Save yourself, tool!

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.170
Tool, get these off!

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:57.010
You are not Thia.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.500
Release me!

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.270
You are another broken tool!

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.300
Remove these!

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:40.050
Or I'll rip out your spine and crush your skull!

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:54.540
You are nothing. A device.

01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:59.490
Made by others to do their work for them.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.800
You betrayed me!

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.890
I trusted you.

01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:56.220
Don't like these tools.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.450
I'm sorry. My Sister is —

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.880
Don't like sister either.

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.300
Tell tool you're asking about the device.

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.130
He's asking about the device.

01:08:24.609 --> 01:08:27.069
It's a children's toy.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:31.399
But say it's a map.

01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:43.590
Tell tool to look inside.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.850
That was a toy for children?

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.130
Yautja children!

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.660
Run, Dek!

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:07.069
Go...Go!

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.960
<i>Enter destination coordinates, Kwei.</i>

01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:59.210
You saved me, brother.

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:05.290
Wolf.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.800
Kalisk.

01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:37.160
Kalisk child.

01:20:37.930 --> 01:20:39.640
I came to rescue you.

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.040
Wolf.

01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.950
Bone Bison.

01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:11.030
Not yet...

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:13.750
Thia

01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:33.690
Kalisk!

01:21:39.610 --> 01:21:41.210
Kalish child!

01:21:45.230 --> 01:21:47.430
They have her mother!

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.320
You free the Kalish.

01:22:06.490 --> 01:22:08.170
I get my trophy.

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.580
You tell me.

01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:55.970
That's not yours.

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:31.570
Not yet.

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.480
You've come here for revenge?

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:31.120
I've come for my cloak.

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.000
What is this?

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:40.200
I've completed my hunt.

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:43.230
That is my trophy.

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.350
You disgrace our clan...

01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:48.090
And so did Kwei.

01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:53.640
Get rid of him.

01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:52.950
Perhaps the right son did survive.

01:36:53.650 --> 01:36:55.310
Yield now...

01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:59.100
...and take your place in our clan.

01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:03.510
I have my own clan.

01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:24.030
No.

01:38:28.410 --> 01:38:30.090
It's my mother.
