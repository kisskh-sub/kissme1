(Li Ke 2, Yan Fei 2, Jiang Chen 1)

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.039
I've been working
on this case for a week

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.479
and revised it twice.

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.080
I don't know what else to do.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.080
You know why Ren Jiatong
didn't have to revise it?

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.879
She also failed her first attempt

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:09.960
and was asked to redo it.

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.800
She first organized the facts

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.159
into a chronological table.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.759
Then she created
a clear and intuitive timeline

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.960
with visualization software.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.960
Then she slowly

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.719
refined the details.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.759
And you?

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.759
Let me put it straight.

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.120
Your long paragraphs

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.759
of endless text give me a headache

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:28.560
every time.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.120
Not to mention Ms. Bai,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.199
who's so busy.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.319
It's easier

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.919
to just flip through the case file.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.360
Besides,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.840
Ren Jiatong also attached a draft

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.120
of her legal opinion

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.000
to the review notes she submitted.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:44.879
So what did Ms. Bai say?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.000
She said,

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.919
"It seems I can rest early today."

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:58.984
Here.

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.056
Jiang Chen.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.680
I bet you know

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.199
that the use of AI in law

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.680
is becoming

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.919
more widespread worldwide.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.224
Yeah.

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:11.240
My classmates in the U.S.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.039
are also using AI at law firms.

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.080
And AI is indeed

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.000
very powerful.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.519
I heard that several
domestic Red Circle Firms

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.279
laid off their entire
translation departments.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.199
So you should know

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:26.839
that AI can complete
basic tasks like case review.

00:04:27.208 --> 00:04:30.000
This is a cost-saving improvement
for bosses and clients.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.160
If our law firm implements AI

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:33.639
to handle basic tasks

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.959
that first to third-year lawyers

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:37.399
are doing now,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.199
how will you fresh graduates

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:40.920
manage to stay?

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:43.759
Do you have case handling experience,

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:44.519
or do you know

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:46.519
how to deal with clients?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.079
Why are you irreplaceable

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.600
when you compete with AI?

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:56.439
I know what to do now.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.959
Thank you, Ms. Tian.

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:05.160
Way to go, Min.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.040
Great tactic of provocation

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.279
by mentioning AI.

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:11.959
You're flattering me, Mr. Zhou.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.959
I'm just an ordinary senior colleague

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:20.000
who's beautiful,
kind-hearted, and caring.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.319
I'm no match for an expert diplomat

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:24.920
like you.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.759
Please.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.560
I have a reason to be worried.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.120
I seriously don't know

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.000
what our future looks like.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.079
You know what?

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.199
One of my classmates was just laid off.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.000
She has a two-year-old kid.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.040
I'm anxious.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.079
Please.

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.759
Working moms during breastfeeding
shouldn't be anxious.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.800
Be positive.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We're lucky to be

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.240
fifth-year associates.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.480
Even if Jun An

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.319
really uses AI,

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:53.040
we won't be

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:54.399
laid off right away.

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:57.160
What you said

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.160
helped alleviate my aging anxiety.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.319
Well, thanks.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.600
My pleasure.

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:08.360
Mr. Zhou.

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.920
Ms. Tian.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.160
May I go on a field visit
this afternoon?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.480
I'm working on the negotiation

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.560
with the tenants.

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.199
There's still much uncertainty.

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:20.199
So I want to talk to the protesters
at the Warm Nest headquarters.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.959
As I said when assigning this task,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.800
use any necessary methods.
Your field visit is approved.

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:27.240
Thank you.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.319
I'm betting on...

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.416
I'm betting on Ren Jiatong.

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:35.959
I called it first. She's my pick.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.959
Fine.

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:39.480
Then I'll bet on our Haryald prodigy.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.759
What a coincidence.

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.439
Ms. Bai defeated Mr. Song.

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:43.279
You defeated me.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.240
This year, Ren Jiatong

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.160
came on strong.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.120
What's with Jun An's legacy?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.160
Why do women

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.079
keep winning?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.800
Mr. Zhou.

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:54.959
Apply your rigorous logical reasoning.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.879
This isn't a coincidence.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.439
It conclusively proves one thing.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.519
What's that?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.319
Women are simply better.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.920
You redid it again.

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:14.519
Any thoughts?

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.439
Make case review notes,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.720
conduct analyses,

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:19.319
think like a senior lawyer,

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:21.240
identify the key points

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:22.839
and defense strategies.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.639
Those are the keys to case reviews.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.240
I've learned that.

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.279
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:29.704
Not bad.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.800
How did you figure it out?

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.519
Ms. Tian enlightened me.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.680
She asked me

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.839
why I am irreplaceable

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.759
when competing against AI.

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:40.399
I reflected on this.

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:42.399
Let's hear it.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.040
AI is indeed capable, but in the end,

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:48.800
it's still developing.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.959
To extract insights

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:51.839
from case reviews

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:52.759
provided by AI

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:53.879
is where I must improve.

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:55.560
Make AI work for me.

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:56.879
Don't let it replace me.

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:58.759
This is my career focus.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:00.968
Good.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.839
You can wrap up this task now.

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:06.720
Focus on the Warm Nest project.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.872
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:25.720
Hi, Auntie.

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:26.560
What's up?

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.240
Chen.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.079
I heard

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:30.639
Jun An is representing Warm Nest.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.159
Is that true?

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:33.399
Stay out of it,

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:34.279
got it?

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:36.399
Auntie, it's not what you think.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:37.960
Let me explain tonight.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:38.759
Okay?

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.000
Fine.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.320
Landlords in our group chat say

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:45.960
they're protesting
at the Warm Nest headquarters.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.279
They asked us to go

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:49.360
and make a scene there.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.799
Then they might pay up.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:52.600
You want to cause trouble? When?

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:54.759
We're not causing any trouble.

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:57.480
I'm heading out after this call.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.399
They say it's well-organized

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:01.440
and quite impactful.

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:02.720
Stay home.

00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:04.879
Auntie, listen to me.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:07.039
Don't get involved, okay?

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.279
We'll talk tonight.

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:10.792
Bye.

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:12.168
Hello?

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:18.920
What happened to Warm Nest?

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:21.120
I heard from Mr. Zhou

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.600
that Ren Jiatong went to Warm Nest.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.720
She went there?

00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:25.879
Do you think

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:26.960
she got some information

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.200
from that tenant group chat?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
She does have an edge
in handling this case.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.919
There's a protest there.

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:34.480
Jun An's representation of Warm Nest

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.360
infuriated them.

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:36.960
Ren Jiatong's video went viral.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.080
Is she in danger there?

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:39.480
I need to go.

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:43.799
I'll go with you

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:45.480
to help out.

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:50.360
Do you think it's going to work?

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:51.679
Nobody is showing up.

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:52.879
We haven't had food or water

00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:54.039
(Unwavering determination)
for days.

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:55.240
What's going on?

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:56.960
When will this ever end?

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.720
Hurry up and pay us back!

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.440
Pay us back!

00:10:00.712 --> 00:10:02.320
- Pay us back!
- We have been here for long.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.759
(Warm Nest scam! Lost everything!)
I can't take this anymore.

00:10:06.888 --> 00:10:07.399
(Stop fraud and return
our hard-earned money)

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.200
Life is tough.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.360
Be careful.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.559
Auntie, maybe you should

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:15.120
go home and rest.

00:10:15.208 --> 00:10:15.799
(Stop fraud and return
our hard-earned money)

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:16.759
My son

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.759
insisted our whole family come here,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.279
saying a big crowd makes more impact.

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:24.120
That will force Warm Nest to pay up.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.799
- Are you a landlady or a tenant?
- No updates at all.

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:28.679
Auntie, don't talk to her.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.480
(Pay back)
She's Warm Nest's lawyer.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.440
She's against us.

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:33.039
How dare you!

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.240
Trying to scam us, are you?

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.440
What do you want?

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:37.799
Guys, come!

00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:38.559
Let's take a look.

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:39.840
Drop the act!

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.039
Still trying to trick us?

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.240
I knew all lawyers were scum.

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:45.080
Yes! Capitalists' lapdogs!

00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:46.480
(Pay back)
Wait.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.279
This girl is kind-hearted.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.279
She helped me up when I fell earlier.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.639
Don't let her fool you!

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:55.159
She's with Warm Nest.

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:57.000
- Yeah.
- She's one of those scammers.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.159
- Exactly!
- Scammers!

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.399
Don't speak to her!

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.480
Don't speak to her. She's a scammer.

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:07.799
Pay us back!

00:11:20.136 --> 00:11:20.712
(Emergency)

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.360
Am I right?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.759
Pay up!

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:34.799
Pay up!

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:36.000
Our hard-earned money!

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.240
Pay us back!

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:39.279
Pay us back!

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:40.679
Pay up now!

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.200
Pay up!

00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:44.240
Pay us back!

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:45.720
Pay up now!

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:05.440
Stop! You hit her on purpose!

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.000
Are you hurt?

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:11.440
Trying to leave?

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:21.840
No way!

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.679
Back off!

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:24.120
He hit him.

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:25.679
He attacked him.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.279
How dare they hit someone!

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.679
What happened?

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:44.200
Come on.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.808
It's fine.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.159
Outrageous.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.840
Not paying and hitting people?

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.799
I can't move.

00:12:56.091 --> 00:12:57.480
(Loyalty, Integrity, Service,
Standardization, Pragmatism, Efficiency)

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.104
(Case Handling Area)

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.360
What's your plan?

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:03.919
He looks injured

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.320
and demands an assessment.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:09.960
This one.

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:11.440
Put this on.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.840
If he is confirmed with minor injuries

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.639
and causes trouble,

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:16.040
you may get kicked out from Jun An.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.200
It's fine.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.600
I just gave him a light push.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.159
Who knew

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:25.639
a young guy would be so unsteady?

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.399
He fell from one little shove.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.159
Right?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:30.799
Stay calm.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.559
Why did you come?

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:34.600
Jiang Chen

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:37.000
heard about the protest from his aunt

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.759
and rushed over

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.360
to you without asking for leave.

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:40.080
Nonsense.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.120
I went there for the case proposal.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.559
I had to understand
the tenants' situation

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:48.720
to figure out how to provide

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.039
corporate planning services
for Warm Nest Apartments.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.879
Corporate planning?

00:13:55.528 --> 00:13:56.639
Who called the police?

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:57.544
Come over here.

00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:58.320
I did.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:58.840
Officer.

00:14:02.268 --> 00:14:04.360
(Case Handling Area)

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.840
You said you came

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.600
for Warm Nest's corporate planning.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.592
Really?

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:12.968
Yeah.

00:14:14.039 --> 00:14:15.960
Warm Nest Apartments
just had a huge crisis.

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:19.120
They must have failed in risk control

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.000
or messed up other preparations,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.720
leading to this major crisis.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.159
If we follow your proposal,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.320
and they achieve

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.759
reconciliation this time,

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:28.679
the risk of another collapse remains.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.000
So I was thinking

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.080
maybe we could offer

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.960
to provide them
with corporate planning services

00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:37.480
to minimize future risks.

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:44.440
Well said.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.279
But I think you're improvising.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.480
Great guess.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.639
But you have no proof.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.960
Plus, my intelligence allows me

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.559
to spout nonsense

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:54.440
with a straight face.

00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:04.559
Why didn't you

00:15:05.919 --> 00:15:06.759
dodge earlier?

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:08.840
You just stood there.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.000
How do you plan to repay me,

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.120
your life savior?

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.960
Life savior?

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:33.919
You got framed
for blocking that minor hit

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.200
and got dragged here

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.559
during work hours.

00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:38.360
You can question

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.039
my professionalism,

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:42.039
but never doubt my capabilities.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.639
Ever watched The Flash?

00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:46.039
I moved at lightning speed,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.879
saved you in one second

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:49.279
and stopped all chaos.

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:52.840
With such extensive knowledge,

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.440
think about what to tell our superiors.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.320
Why did you push him?

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.840
You majored in law.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.720
Shouldn't you assess risks
before every act?

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.799
I knew he was about to charge.

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:02.720
I had to protect you.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.919
Jun An members shouldn't get bullied

00:16:11.919 --> 00:16:13.039
by outsiders.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.559
No one gets to bully me.

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:27.240
Your forehead is swollen.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.039
Looks like you grew a horn.

00:16:29.159 --> 00:16:29.919
Put some ice on it.

00:16:31.159 --> 00:16:31.799
No need.

00:16:31.799 --> 00:16:32.488

♪This one is so true♪

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.720
They're asking where we are.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.880
What should I tell them?

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:42.599
Don't reply yet.
Jiang Chen is still in there.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.279
You think

00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:46.640
I enjoy tattling, huh?

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.039
Jiang Chen is one of us after all.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.720
That's not what I meant.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.799
But honestly,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.160
something is wrong.

00:18:00.759 --> 00:18:02.359
Why is he still not out?

00:18:02.359 --> 00:18:04.359
There's surveillance footage.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.200
Nothing complicated.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.119
They should've been done.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.039
Is he actually in trouble?

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.799
I'll go check.

00:18:15.356 --> 00:18:18.519
(Consultation)

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:19.799
Excuse me, officer.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.759
I-I'm Liang Xiaosong's sister.

00:18:22.759 --> 00:18:23.720
What happened to him?

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.279
Is he okay?

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:26.920
His family member.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.200
Hello, officer.

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:30.920
We're from Jun An Law Firm.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.279
You're from Jun An?

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.119
Zhou Nian, come here.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.000
I'm at the police station.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.839
Xiaosong got beaten up.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.119
The attacker

00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:49.960
claims to be from your firm.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:52.968
Zhou Nian?

00:18:54.888 --> 00:18:55.440
Stay calm.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.119
I'm on my way.

00:18:56.359 --> 00:18:57.928
It's rush hour. I can't get a ride.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.519
I'll hail a cab on the street.

00:19:00.119 --> 00:19:00.880
Okay, got it.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.039
Something urgent?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.720
My brother-in-law is
at the police station.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:06.880
Ride with me.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.720
It will be faster.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.400
Okay, thanks.

00:19:14.939 --> 00:19:19.080
(Police)

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.891
(Baishuiqiao Police Station)

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.640
Thank you.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.279
I have to go.

00:19:23.931 --> 00:19:28.456
(Police)

00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:32.456
(Case Handling Area)

00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:36.759
Are you okay?

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.592
Alright.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200
Since the family came

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:42.720
and you agreed to settle,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.640
this matter

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.279
is resolved.

00:19:44.759 --> 00:19:45.559
Behave yourselves.

00:19:46.279 --> 00:19:46.792
Wait.

00:19:47.079 --> 00:19:47.656
Officer.

00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:49.960
What about my medical expenses
and compensation?

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:50.880
Come on, I...

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.839
I want him to apologize to my colleague.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.720
Apologize to her?

00:19:56.319 --> 00:19:57.079
Are you serious?

00:19:57.559 --> 00:19:58.440
I'm the injured one.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.279
Listen up, pretty boy.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.440
Don't be cocky.
My brother-in-law is here.

00:20:06.759 --> 00:20:07.624
Your brother-in-law?

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.720
A bunch of junior interns.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.680
Don't get cocky.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.240
My brother-in-law is your mentor.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.559
I don't want to talk to them.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.960
You have to stand up for me.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.680
That's not how it works.

00:20:32.039 --> 00:20:33.920
The surveillance footage showed that

00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:35.240
Xiaosong was causing trouble.

00:20:35.519 --> 00:20:37.039
He pushed our intern

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.312
and threw a bottle at her.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.200
Truth is, he's more at fault.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.599
If she actually

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:43.559
got minor injury certifications,

00:20:43.839 --> 00:20:45.200
he might've been detained.

00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:46.440
Can your parents

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:47.839
handle the consequences?

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.480
He's better off settling.

00:20:49.839 --> 00:20:52.279
Zhou Nian, whose side are you on?

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.440
You've only been

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.319
their mentor for less than a month.

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:57.000
How could you side with them?

00:20:57.559 --> 00:20:58.160
What?

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.680
You have a crush on that girl?

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.160
Of course, I'm on your side.

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:08.039
I became a mentor

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.400
to buy a house and marry you.

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:13.359
If you don't like it,
I'll quit tomorrow.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.472
Okay?

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:17.880
You can't

00:21:19.119 --> 00:21:20.920
keep blindly taking Xiaosong's word

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.960
for everything.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.359
He was in the wrong today.

00:21:24.319 --> 00:21:25.960
I know those kids.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.680
They'll become excellent lawyers.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.160
They wouldn't cause trouble.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.359
Excellent lawyers?

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.160
Define excellent lawyers.

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:33.279
Zhou Nian.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.079
Do you count as one?

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.960
We've been together
since your master's degree.

00:21:39.519 --> 00:21:40.160
For seven years,

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.400
I accompanied you through exams

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.559
and job applications.

00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:46.519
I asked you to buy a house
so that we could live alone.

00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:48.559
And it's like we're pressuring you.

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:50.888
Zhou Nian,

00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:53.599
do you know why we're still not married

00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:54.680
after all this time?

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.599
Do you know how many times

00:21:56.599 --> 00:21:58.200
I've fought with my parents over you?

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.559
Do you realize

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:01.160
I don't want to marry you anymore?

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.359
Because I know that

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.279
even if we're married,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.680
the next decades

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.839
will just be more of this.

00:22:09.279 --> 00:22:10.680
I'll wait for you to finish work,

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.920
to have days off,

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.559
to make more money,

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:15.359
and to have time for me.

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:17.079
My brother got into

00:22:17.079 --> 00:22:18.599
some trouble today,

00:22:18.599 --> 00:22:20.000
and you sided with outsiders.

00:22:21.079 --> 00:22:21.599
Zhou Nian,

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.000
I should've known seven years ago

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.559
that you'd never be there for me.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.240
Mr. Zhou.

00:22:34.759 --> 00:22:36.240
You left your phone in my car.

00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:45.599
Zhou Nian.

00:22:51.039 --> 00:22:53.119
I think we're done.

00:22:53.628 --> 00:22:57.480
(Police)

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.120
Wait.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.039
I'm sorry.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.799
Did I come at a bad time?

00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:05.759
Come on. Let's explain to her.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.016
Don't bother.

00:23:12.839 --> 00:23:13.839
I always thought

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:16.200
I had to marry her because

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.880
I'd held her back for so long.

00:23:21.759 --> 00:23:23.839
But now I realize that marriage alone

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.119
isn't what she wants.

00:23:29.359 --> 00:23:29.960
Well,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.839
I can finally relax now.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.640
Sorry. Jiang Chen
and the others are still inside.

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:44.599
Say goodbye for me.

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:46.856
They've settled.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.359
I'm off.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.559
Li Ke has already gone home.

00:24:01.559 --> 00:24:02.680
Why are you following me?

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:08.799
I'm just on my way home.

00:24:09.599 --> 00:24:10.359
That's all.

00:24:12.319 --> 00:24:13.319
Besides, I'm making sure

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.079
that you don't

00:24:14.079 --> 00:24:14.880
end up fighting

00:24:15.119 --> 00:24:16.799
with someone on the way.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.200
Don't be silly.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.000
I'm not leaping from Law on Security
Administration Punishments

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.240
straight to the Criminal Law.

00:24:22.519 --> 00:24:23.680
Am I capable of that?

00:24:24.319 --> 00:24:25.039
I'm not stupid.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.880
And I know

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.119
we should accept others' care.

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:32.240
And to ask for help when needed

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.640
is an important skill too.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.839
Being a lawyer felt so tough today.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.680
Zhou Nian defended us

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:50.640
and lost his girlfriend

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.440
of seven years.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.559
I'm starting to get swayed.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.640
Lawyers are stressed
especially in the early years.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.799
It's hard to balance work and family.

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:01.720
Then their love wears off

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.359
when they finally
get a break from the job.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.759
So why pursue this job?

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:14.000
When I was young,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.480
my parents fought every day.

00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:17.680
I'd hide in my room reading comics

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:19.400
where the superheroes

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.319
had even harder lives than mine.

00:25:21.599 --> 00:25:22.880
Many didn't have both parents

00:25:23.079 --> 00:25:24.559
but still became incredible.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.839
Plus, I want to see whether I could

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.480
be a good lawyer

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.359
while having a nice relationship.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.279
Jiang Chen.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.079
Thanks for standing up for me today.

00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:42.240
All these years,

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.440
you're the first to stand up for me.

00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:48.400
After my dad passed,

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.640
I had to face every family crisis alone.

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:54.359
Since high school, I've learned

00:25:55.119 --> 00:25:56.079
that I must

00:25:56.359 --> 00:25:58.319
protect my mom to let my dad

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.559
rest in peace.

00:26:02.839 --> 00:26:03.480
This is

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.880
the first time someone

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.279
has stood up for me after my dad died.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.920
It's my pleasure

00:26:17.319 --> 00:26:18.359
to stand up for you.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.039
That sounded almost like

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.400
a confession.

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:31.160
No, no.

00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:33.519
You're my friend, my buddy.

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:36.000
Don't push your luck here.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.839
Exactly.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.119
I don't want to

00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:45.720
compete with you by crushing

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.440
your morale.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.720
I want a real victory.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.279
I'm almost home.

00:26:52.039 --> 00:26:52.799
Go home.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.799
Review the case files.

00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:56.160
Get the case analysis done.

00:26:56.319 --> 00:26:58.079
Otherwise, beating you
won't be exciting.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.440
Fine, Ren Jiatong.

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:04.319
I'm impressed.

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:06.960
"Won't be exciting"? Alright.

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:08.279
Courtroom debater.

00:27:08.359 --> 00:27:08.936
Alright.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.024
Bye.

00:27:14.319 --> 00:27:14.880
Ren Jiatong.

00:27:18.319 --> 00:27:19.920
Talk things through with Guo Xiaoyu.

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.119
Don't lose your friend

00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:24.160
to this job.

00:27:55.359 --> 00:27:56.880
Are you going to keep ignoring me?

00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:00.079
It was clearly your mistake.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.160
So don't blame me.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.360
What...

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.960
What happened to you?

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.319
Jiang Chen said that

00:28:12.319 --> 00:28:13.640
you ran into trouble.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
How did you get hurt?

00:28:15.119 --> 00:28:15.880
Got it checked?

00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:16.960
Will it leave a scar?

00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:21.680
Let me have some water

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.240
before your interrogation, okay?

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.000
You just wouldn't listen to me.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.319
See, now you're

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.559
caught in the middle.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:40.720
Look up.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:41.839
What's this?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.880
Marinated pork belly.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.680
I already iced it, thanks.

00:29:07.319 --> 00:29:08.559
Opposing Counsel.

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:10.160
Is it my turn to speak now?

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.319
Knock it off.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.359
Don't you want to know

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.160
why I insisted on taking this case?

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.319
To win, obviously.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.119
Not entirely.

00:29:20.279 --> 00:29:21.160
It's also for us.

00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:26.039
We both paid
six months' rent to Warm Nest.

00:29:26.279 --> 00:29:28.160
That's not a small amount of money.

00:29:28.519 --> 00:29:30.359
All those victims must be furious

00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:32.279
with Warm Nest now.

00:29:32.519 --> 00:29:34.039
Why are you helping Warm Nest?

00:29:34.279 --> 00:29:35.319
Without a settlement,

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.359
we'll never get our money back.

00:29:38.599 --> 00:29:40.799
Our job as lawyers is to solve problems.

00:29:40.839 --> 00:29:42.279
If both parties compromise

00:29:42.359 --> 00:29:43.640
on something reasonable,

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.400
then the issue is resolved.

00:29:46.039 --> 00:29:47.559
If we can help

00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:49.519
Warm Nest get through this

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.920
and assist the victims

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.440
in recovering some of their losses,

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.759
why wouldn't we do it?

00:29:56.519 --> 00:29:57.880
That makes sense in theory,

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.279
but it's not that easy.

00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:01.559
Besides, our firm represents Warm Nest.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.119
Of course, we will

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.160
prioritize Warm Nest's interests.

00:30:05.519 --> 00:30:07.839
Nobody will care about the tenants.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.640
Your idol Mr. Song once said

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:12.200
that negotiations aren't zero-sum

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.640
in the adult world.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.279
The ultimate goal is to make deals

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.960
where both sides get what they need.

00:30:18.319 --> 00:30:20.039
So why can't we create a win-win

00:30:20.279 --> 00:30:21.920
or even triple-win scenario?

00:30:23.759 --> 00:30:26.000
The best case is that everyone's happy.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.599
Even the worst case

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.440
is better than the current situation.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.519
At least, I would have

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.599
fought for my rights.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.720
I think I know how to approach

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.920
this assessment now.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.759
Just like that?

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.359
You're staying?

00:30:43.519 --> 00:30:44.680
Of course, I'm staying.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.319
I haven't shown my talents yet.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.200
My idol also said

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:51.000
that you must take initiative

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.200
in the adult world.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.359
If you dislike others' solutions,

00:30:54.599 --> 00:30:56.279
present your own alternatives.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.279
For example,

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.880
I'll take the initiative to hug you now.

00:31:04.759 --> 00:31:06.160
Enough.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.920
How old are you?

00:31:15.515 --> 00:31:16.520
(Unethical lawyer assaulted me.
So hard to protect my rights legally.)

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.448
(@Jun An Law Firm, @Warm Nest)

00:31:17.448 --> 00:31:18.720
(It's him, right?)

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.272
Oh no.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.599
Bad news.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.720
I figured out

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.680
why Liang Xiaosong went crazy

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.960
and slandered us on Weibo.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.559
Come on, spit it out.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.759
Is it because

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.640
Mr. Zhou defended me
at the police station?

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.240
Is it because his fiancée got jealous

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.240
and sought revenge?

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.359
No, our future sister-in-law is nice.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.240
They just broke up.

00:31:49.359 --> 00:31:50.480
She's heartbroken.

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:52.040
Their seven-year relationship

00:31:52.119 --> 00:31:53.880
was lost to this
one-month apprenticeship.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:54.839
She must have

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.720
cried all night.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.640
Her brother must have felt bad for her,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.039
thinking that Jun An
ganged up against her.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.920
So he wanted to escalate it

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:03.920
to mess with us.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.960
I actually feel bad for Mr. Zhou.

00:32:07.119 --> 00:32:08.519
Weren't they together for ages?

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.480
I heard they were getting married soon.

00:32:11.079 --> 00:32:13.599
But I recently did a tarot for Mr. Zhou.

00:32:13.759 --> 00:32:15.400
His love prospects look good this year.

00:32:15.759 --> 00:32:17.480
I bet they won't really break up.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.559
If he just apologizes and comforts her,

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:20.200
they'll be fine.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.880
I don't think he is very skilled at

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.799
comforting her.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.359
Should we help him out?

00:32:27.799 --> 00:32:28.319
Alright.

00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:30.640
My knowledge of
"how to win back your wife"

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.759
can finally be put to good use.

00:32:33.119 --> 00:32:34.519
We'll split into two groups.

00:32:34.559 --> 00:32:35.400
We girls will...

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.519
No, you girls

00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:37.680
will team up

00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:39.480
and give Mr. Zhou a preview

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.039
of how to win back his wife.

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:42.000
Alright?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.880
Jiang Chen, let's find
Liang Xiaosong at noon.

00:32:44.039 --> 00:32:45.680
You'll apologize to him.

00:32:46.079 --> 00:32:47.240
While the post hasn't

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.519
attracted much attention,

00:32:48.839 --> 00:32:49.799
we'll ask him to

00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:50.559
delete the post.

00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:51.559
And it's over.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.000
Good idea.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.880
I don't want Mr. Zhou to break up

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.880
with his girlfriend.

00:33:00.119 --> 00:33:01.200
But I won't apologize.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.279
The one at fault is not me,

00:33:04.039 --> 00:33:04.799
but Liang Xiaosong.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:06.759
Jiang Chen.

00:33:07.759 --> 00:33:09.960
Mr. Zhou's been good to us, right?

00:33:10.359 --> 00:33:12.720
Apologizing won't kill you.

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:14.519
And I said I'll go with you.

00:33:14.519 --> 00:33:16.079
We'll record the whole thing.

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:17.960
If they try

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.160
to pull any shady moves,

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:19.880
we'll be prepared.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.160
He's right, Jiang Chen.

00:33:23.079 --> 00:33:25.119
Apologizing doesn't seem like

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.440
a matter of principle here.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.319
Didn't you see

00:33:28.319 --> 00:33:30.160
the comments under that Weibo post?

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.400
The most-liked

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.839
was your photo and profile.

00:33:33.079 --> 00:33:34.559
Aren't you worried?

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.480
I've preserved the post as evidence.

00:33:37.759 --> 00:33:38.759
I can pursue

00:33:38.759 --> 00:33:40.559
legal action against him anytime.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.920
And you got the point.

00:33:42.279 --> 00:33:43.599
This is about principles.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:44.920
I won't

00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:46.559
apologize for something

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.599
I didn't do wrong.

00:33:48.079 --> 00:33:49.319
If I abandoned this principle,

00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:50.359
I wouldn't be here,

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.039
trying to be a lawyer.

00:34:09.275 --> 00:34:14.952
(Accumulated Scores)

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.000
Jiang Chen.

00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:19.440
You have the highest score among us.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:22.760
What if you lose points because of this?

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:25.440
All your previous efforts would be...

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.056
Mr. Zhuang.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.599
How should we handle

00:34:35.599 --> 00:34:36.679
Jiang Chen's case?

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.079
First,

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.000
he caused trouble during work hours.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.159
Second, this matter

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:42.679
was leaked online.

00:34:43.079 --> 00:34:44.519
This reflects very poorly on us.

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:45.679
Besides,

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.719
if we don't discipline him,

00:34:48.079 --> 00:34:49.079
others might think

00:34:49.079 --> 00:34:50.599
Jun An lacks fairness.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.440
What if similar incidents occur?

00:34:52.519 --> 00:34:53.920
We won't be able to do our jobs.

00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:54.760
Yeah.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:55.920
I was on the phone

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.256
(Zhang Kai, 39, Business Development Director)
with Warm Nest's legal director

00:34:57.256 --> 00:34:58.679
for 30 minutes.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.559
He said that

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.639
if we don't handle this seriously,

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.480
he'd file a complaint
with the bar association.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:06.472
Mr. Zhuang,

00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:08.039
these kids are selected

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:09.320
through our high-profile

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.840
Talent Hunt Program.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.679
What if we suppress this

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.480
and the other clients

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.679
have doubts about it?

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.544
Ms. Bai.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.639
Your thoughts?

00:35:20.559 --> 00:35:21.639
I'll move up

00:35:21.639 --> 00:35:23.039
the Warm Nest meeting.

00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:26.119
About those "what if" worries

00:35:26.719 --> 00:35:29.199
and fears you talked about,

00:35:29.679 --> 00:35:30.960
when I first joined Jun An,

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.239
my mentor told me that

00:35:33.719 --> 00:35:35.320
anyone overusing this phrase

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.599
needs to reflect on their competence.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.320
If I recall correctly,

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.079
they are just interns,

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:43.039
not trainee lawyers.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.840
The bar association

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.039
doesn't govern interns.

00:35:46.159 --> 00:35:46.888
Right, Mr. Zhang?

00:35:50.239 --> 00:35:50.760
Come in.

00:35:53.639 --> 00:35:54.320
Mr. Zhuang, sorry

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.239
for the interruption.

00:35:55.239 --> 00:35:56.400
Mr. Liu from Warm Nest

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.608
and their legal director came.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.559
They came right after the phone call.

00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:00.599
To corner us?

00:36:01.679 --> 00:36:02.184
Okay.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:02.960
I see.

00:36:04.199 --> 00:36:04.920
I'll go with you.

00:36:09.756 --> 00:36:10.760
(New email
The deadline has been advanced.)

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.880
(Interns, your mentors decided...)

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.960
There's a new email.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.000
Oh my god.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.920
The deadline was moved up
to 10:00 PM tonight.

00:36:18.159 --> 00:36:19.280
No extensions.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.119
Why?

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.679
The files are still encrypted.

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:24.239
I haven't even sorted them out.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.000
Help. I'm about to have a heart attack.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:32.840
Got the email, huh?

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:34.960
Any questions?

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:35.976
Mr. Zhou.

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:37.000
Why was the deadline

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.239
pushed up by a full day?

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.960
Will this count for points?

00:36:40.159 --> 00:36:40.840
Yes.

00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:42.400
The criteria remain the same.

00:36:42.639 --> 00:36:44.000
As long as you perform well

00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:44.960
in this task,

00:36:45.199 --> 00:36:46.360
you might get bonus points.

00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:47.480
And the deadline

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.119
was moved up

00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:50.119
because our meeting
was rescheduled earlier.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.239
The mentoring lawyers decided

00:36:52.519 --> 00:36:54.480
to take the best proposal drafter
to the meeting.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.079
This is a great opportunity.

00:36:56.559 --> 00:36:58.559
Mr. Zhou, with such tight deadlines,

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.000
can we form teams?

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.280
Excellent question.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.679
You can form teams,

00:37:03.159 --> 00:37:04.039
so there's competition

00:37:04.159 --> 00:37:05.760
both inter-group

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.639
and intra-group.

00:37:07.639 --> 00:37:08.639
So that means

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.719
I need both my group to win

00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:13.599
and my performance to be top in my group

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.880
for high scores.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:15.912
Exactly.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.920
Don't you want to work with top lawyers?

00:37:18.679 --> 00:37:19.360
Rare chance.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.159
Show your best moves now.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.016
Jiang Chen.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.616
Come here.

00:37:33.852 --> 00:37:38.760
(Story 1
Jiang Chen vs. Ren Jiatong)

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.320
Ms. Bai, take a look.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.320
Go home and rest.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
You've been traveling.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.960
Your neck is hurting.

00:37:55.199 --> 00:37:56.760
And you moved up the meeting

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.159
because of Jiang Chen,

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.119
working through the weekend.

00:38:01.239 --> 00:38:02.119
This will help you.

00:38:02.559 --> 00:38:03.519
No need, I'm fine.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.160
Come in.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:06.920
Ms. Bai.

00:38:07.199 --> 00:38:07.816
Ms. Tian.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.079
I'm off.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.136
Ms. Bai.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.000
Mr. Zhou said I might get penalized

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.079
because of the incident.

00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:16.679
Is that true?

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:18.599
Got a problem?

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.119
Yes.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.239
The police determined that I bear

00:38:23.239 --> 00:38:24.360
no legal responsibility.

00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:25.519
Please give me

00:38:25.519 --> 00:38:26.840
a reasonable explanation.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.519
You didn't break any laws,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.400
but it's against protocol

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.320
for you to leave

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.400
without informing
or getting approval from

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.119
any superior

00:38:34.119 --> 00:38:34.840
during work hours.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.119
As someone aspiring to be a lawyer,

00:38:37.199 --> 00:38:38.719
you went to our client's headquarters

00:38:38.719 --> 00:38:39.719
and got into trouble.

00:38:40.119 --> 00:38:41.280
You went to the police,

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.599
and got posted online,

00:38:43.159 --> 00:38:44.679
causing negative publicity

00:38:44.679 --> 00:38:46.079
for both Warm Nest and Jun An.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.000
That's improper.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.440
Besides, your mistake

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.599
forced all those working on this project

00:38:50.599 --> 00:38:51.519
to reschedule meetings

00:38:51.519 --> 00:38:53.599
sooner than planned,

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.199
increasing our workloads.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.480
The deadline was moved up

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.639
for all your peers

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.039
at the Talent Hunt Program

00:39:00.599 --> 00:39:01.239
because of you.

00:39:02.199 --> 00:39:03.639
Aren't these reasons enough?

00:39:08.199 --> 00:39:10.119
Jiang Chen, do you really
want to be a lawyer?

00:39:10.679 --> 00:39:11.336
Of course.

00:39:12.039 --> 00:39:13.519
My senior once told me

00:39:13.519 --> 00:39:14.400
that lawyers

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.320
are ultimately
part of the service industry.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.239
Therefore, we must strive to maximize

00:39:19.519 --> 00:39:21.079
our clients' interests.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.559
Do you agree with this?

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.000
Yes, I do.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.280
Okay.

00:39:26.519 --> 00:39:27.840
Now our client Warm Nest

00:39:28.079 --> 00:39:29.360
believes you made a mistake,

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.440
wants you to apologize,

00:39:30.559 --> 00:39:32.239
and resolve the issue promptly.

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:32.960
What will you do?

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.840
But the problem is,

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.559
my photos were posted online

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.039
with false accusations.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.519
Yet I should apologize?

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.840
Ms. Bai, are you saying

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.199
that I should sacrifice my rights

00:39:42.199 --> 00:39:43.320
for my clients?

00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:44.519
That's your problem.

00:39:45.039 --> 00:39:46.480
Find your own answers.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.039
But first, don't get eliminated.

00:39:48.559 --> 00:39:50.199
I'm only responsible for assessing you.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.559
If you want to stay,

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.679
prove your worth through real skills

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.800
and regain your lost points.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.079
Our law firm

00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:59.199
doesn't exist to hear
the lawyers' complaints.

00:39:59.719 --> 00:40:00.760
We exist to help clients

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.840
solve their problems.

00:40:12.159 --> 00:40:13.559
So you've got principles.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.800
You're in trouble?

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.039
Impressive.

00:40:30.039 --> 00:40:31.079
You saw through me.

00:40:31.519 --> 00:40:32.360
Keep it a secret.

00:40:34.039 --> 00:40:35.519
After talking with Ms. Bai,

00:40:35.519 --> 00:40:36.840
you've been off all morning.

00:40:37.639 --> 00:40:38.400
What happened?

00:40:41.079 --> 00:40:42.280
Since when do you care?

00:40:42.559 --> 00:40:44.000
Don't get me wrong. I don't care.

00:40:46.599 --> 00:40:48.639
I saw Warm Nest's Mr. Liu
meeting with Mr. Zhuang.

00:40:49.039 --> 00:40:49.880
Is it about this?

00:40:57.559 --> 00:40:58.344
Let's talk outside.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.119
Listen to Li Ke.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.320
Don't delay this.

00:41:06.559 --> 00:41:08.239
Solve this problem now.

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:11.480
I thought you were different.

00:41:11.679 --> 00:41:12.920
But you're pressuring me too.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.039
Jiang Chen.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.679
This Weibo post
contains your information.

00:41:16.679 --> 00:41:18.519
It also tags Jun An and Warm Nest.

00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:20.039
It's no longer about who's right

00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:20.840
or wrong.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.519
Our job as lawyers is to solve problems.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.079
You shouldn't create issues

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.840
just to prove you're right.

00:41:27.039 --> 00:41:28.320
I don't mean to create issues.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.480
I want to resolve this, too.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.199
Li Ke makes valid points.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.159
I shouldn't let my principles

00:41:33.559 --> 00:41:35.440
ruin Mr. Zhou's engagement.

00:41:35.719 --> 00:41:36.639
So I'll compensate.

00:41:37.039 --> 00:41:38.119
I'll pay no matter

00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:39.199
how much he demands.

00:41:39.199 --> 00:41:39.760
I accept that.

00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:41.320
But I can't apologize.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:41.960
Got it?

00:41:42.119 --> 00:41:42.960
What should I say?

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.320
Sorry you tried to assault my colleague.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.039
I apologize.

00:41:46.239 --> 00:41:47.800
Sorry you twisted the truth.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.424
I apologize.

00:41:48.424 --> 00:41:49.880
Sorry you posted slanderous posts.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.519
I apologize.

00:41:50.679 --> 00:41:51.840
It's ridiculous, you know?

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.320
I can't convince myself to do this.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.639
Do you want to stay?

00:41:55.199 --> 00:41:57.519
The Weibo comments haven't exploded yet.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.039
We can stop this.

00:41:59.039 --> 00:41:59.760
Apologize

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.800
and he might delete it.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.000
Then it's settled.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.719
If it escalates and ruins

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.119
Warm Nest's reputation,

00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:06.199
they'll come after you.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.039
What then?

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.440
No matter how well Jun An treats us,

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.599
it's still a law firm.

00:42:11.039 --> 00:42:12.599
With such fierce competition,

00:42:12.679 --> 00:42:13.559
when choosing between

00:42:13.559 --> 00:42:15.559
a major client
and a Talent Hunt Program intern,

00:42:16.039 --> 00:42:17.840
are you sure Jun An will side with you?

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.119
Ms. Bai just asked me the same question.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:23.559
What did you say?

00:42:24.119 --> 00:42:24.920
Nothing.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.800
I have no answer.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:27.559
All I know is,

00:42:27.559 --> 00:42:29.400
I can't betray my intention
of studying law.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:30.760
Right is right.

00:42:31.119 --> 00:42:32.039
Wrong is wrong.

00:42:32.639 --> 00:42:34.039
I didn't study law to learn

00:42:34.039 --> 00:42:35.559
how to twist right into wrong.

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:40.760
What's so funny?

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.519
Am I being naive?

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:44.840
Not at all.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.639
It's not funny.

00:42:48.239 --> 00:42:49.000
You're precious.

00:42:50.679 --> 00:42:52.320
Idealism is rare.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.199
So it's valuable.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.760
But if this world

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.480
lacks idealists like you,

00:42:57.239 --> 00:42:58.119
what's the point?

00:43:15.515 --> 00:43:17.160
(Ethical dilemmas:
principles vs. client/firm interests)

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.696
(Answer: Legal practitioners
must protect clients')

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.424
(legitimate rights
and interests, and social justice.)

00:43:20.424 --> 00:43:21.800
(Meanwhile, lawyers have
diligence obligations to their firms.)

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.432
(Lawyers often face conflicts
between personal principles)

00:43:23.432 --> 00:43:24.776
(and client demands
and the law firm's interests.)

00:43:24.776 --> 00:43:26.216
(They must seek alternative solutions)

00:43:26.216 --> 00:43:27.656
(through rule comprehension
and risk assessment.)
