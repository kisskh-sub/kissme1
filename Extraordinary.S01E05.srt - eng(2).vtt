00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.359
Young Duke

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.320
Young Duke

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.960
Young Duke

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.040
His Majesty summons you.

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.200
Come with this servant.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.359
Well, Shi Feifan!

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.840
You assaulted the Qiang envoy.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.000
Do you admit your guilt?

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.519
Replying to Your Majesty,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.599
I do not.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.000
The facts are clear, yet you deny it.

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:22.319
Guards, beat him for us!

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:23.200
Brother, I was wrong.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.239
No, no.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.519
Your Majesty, let's talk calmly.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:27.519
Let's talk calmly.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.840
You truly aren't afraid we'll punish you?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.840
I'm not afraid.

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.680
If Your Majesty wished to punish me,

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:36.400
the authorities could have arrested me.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.079
But Your Majesty did not do so.

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.400
You're quite clever.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.239
Then guess why we didn't do it.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.920
I won't guess.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.319
Guess right, and it's prying into royal intent.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.120
Guess wrong, and I give others a handle.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.359
You know how to act and retreat.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.280
Rise.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.199
Envoy, it's been a long time.

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.840
Your Highness, I hope you've been well.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.439
For decades now,

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.919
our country and Qiang have traded.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.439
Border folk have been spared war.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.639
But Qiang is truly shameless.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.280
They sent a rogue envoy to threaten us.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.479
Demanding more tribute.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.960
Negotiation is our only option now.

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.360
Your Majesty, please spare me.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.919
I'm inexperienced, unfit for heavy tasks.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Right now, I just want to do small business.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.400
That would satisfy me.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.280
Are you bargaining with us?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.719
I dare not.

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.479
Rest assured.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.800
As long as you complete this task,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.240
what you wish will be granted.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.439
Really?

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.919
But what if...

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.599
"What if" isn't in our vocabulary.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.800
Your Majesty, rest assured.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.479
I have my own way.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.879
Good.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.199
We await your good news.

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.280
Then what post will Your Majesty grant me?

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.639
Steward.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.520
Order Vice General Zhang.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.520
Enough, enough.

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.599
Duke, Duke!

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.879
Young Duke became a dog official!

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.639
Nonsense, what dog official?

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.479
Ling Gou Official.

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:11.680
Yes, yes.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.840
Son,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.280
His Majesty let you

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.000
Ling Gou Official is too minor a post.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.879
This is hard to handle.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.720
I shouldn't have advocated negotiation at court.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.480
Now it's hard to back down.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.279
No.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.079
I'll go to the palace now.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.040
Father.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.480
If no one advocates negotiation,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.560
war will surely break out.

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:37.800
It will harm the nation and the people.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.120
And once war starts,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.000
the Shi Family Army will be sent first.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.360
You were right to advocate negotiation.

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:44.560
Father.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.600
Don't worry.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.600
Your son is brave and wise.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.800
Chivalrous and loyal.

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:52.879
If anyone can handle the Qiang envoy, it's me.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.959
Are you confident?

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.279
I'm fully prepared.

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:05.439
Mother, he became a dog official!

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.439
Child,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.319
It's "Gou," Ling Gou Official.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.319
Not "dog official."

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.759
Ling Gou Official.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.639
Dog official.

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.360
A child's nature shows early.

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:20.480
Young Duke.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.240
I heard the Qiang envoy

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.600
has checked into Hui Fang Suo.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.040
Good.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.920
Let's go meet him.

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:34.839
Is the Hui Fang Suo chief courting death?

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.120
Why hasn't he come to serve us?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.439
Tiny country, wild people.

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:43.319
Our three hundred thousand cavalry

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.040
could crush the Southern Dynasty.

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.040
Sir,

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:47.800
aren't you afraid we'll raise an army

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:49.079
to demand an explanation?

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.639
Uh...

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.680
Who's causing trouble on my turf?

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:07.519
You again.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.319
It's you.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:10.839
What?

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.519
Didn't get enough of a beating last time?

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:21.240
Brought backup?

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:24.040
Seems you really aren't afraid of a beating.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.240
I won't waste words with a minor official.

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:29.000
Have your emperor come in person.

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:32.759
You were just shouting

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:34.199
that our nations should go to war.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.040
That's right.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.199
In recent years, Qiang

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.600
has annexed plateau tribes.

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:38.560
We've readied our troops.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.920
We have three hundred thousand cavalry.

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:41.639
Countless warriors in our ranks.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:42.439
Once we march south,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.839
we'll easily take Yun Zhou and Shu Zhou.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.319
How can the Southern Dynasty resist?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.480
What?

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:50.680
You don't believe?

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.639
Then let's prove it with strength.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.319
How?

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.199
Each side sends one for a contest.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.639
If you lose,

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.240
the princess marries us at once.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.839
Annual tribute increases tenfold.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.920
But no bows or crossbows like last time.

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:04.839
Do you dare?

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:08.040
Negotiations between nations

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.560
aren't child's play.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.800
Afraid?

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:16.360
Then let's lower the stakes.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.759
The loser

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.959
kneels and begs for mercy.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.079
This is their provocation tactic.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.920
We must not fall for it.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:27.279
Fine.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160
We'll do as you say.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.279
Your Highness

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.399
What are your orders?

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:45.720
The main event at Hui Fang Suo begins.

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:50.199
If the Qiang envoy dies by Shi Feifan's hand,

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:55.120
how should the Emperor deal with him?

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.439
Since the rules are set,

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:06.959
let's get started.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.959
This is Balu, a warrior from my army.

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:17.519
Who will you send to fight?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.120
Me.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.600
Ling Gou Official, this is no child's play.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.919
Does Liang have no one else?

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.799
You're so frail.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.879
Are you sure you want to fight yourself?

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.639
Then let's wait and see.

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:48.639
Am I seeing this right?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.919
Such a little kid.

00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:54.559
My Gatling will keep him away.

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:59.200
My broadsword can tear you to pieces.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:05.679
What...

00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:15.480
Our Southern Dynasty is a land of etiquette.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.759
We always win people over with virtue.

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:27.240
Never bully the weak with strength.

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:30.120
Balu.

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:31.639
You used a hidden weapon.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.600
Young Duke, we won!

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.600
You Southerners are so unfair.

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:40.919
What are you doing?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.159
With my truth,

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:46.360
I'll send you, a savage little thief,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.399
to meet your ancestors.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.120
Take a guess.

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:52.879
Do you think I'd blow your head off?

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:55.440
I'm a dignified envoy.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.240
I don't believe you'd dare touch me.

00:09:57.399 --> 00:09:58.720
Let me ask you,

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:00.000
would I dare?

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.200
You would.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.000
Blue sparks are flying!

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.440
O-official...

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:20.840
This firepower is too strong.

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:24.799
Let's leave for now.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.720
Go. Okay.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:26.720
Go.

00:10:27.639 --> 00:10:29.200
Shi Ling Gou, we'll see about this.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.960
I'll be waiting for you.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.720
Young Duke, you're amazing!

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.440
Ling Gou Official is so brave!

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.200
Careful, envoy.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:39.840
Official.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.720
You're great too.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.480
Balu.

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.320
You Southerners are so unfair.

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:47.519
That wasn't me.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.600
Come.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.720
It's getting more interesting.

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:07.799
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:10.600
Shi Ling Gou really put the Qiang envoy in his place today.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.879
There's always someone better out there.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.840
Tell us quickly,

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.840
how did he do it?

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.360
Shi Ling Gou had a bet and contest with the Qiang envoy today.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.759
The Qiang delegation sent a strongman.

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:23.600
But he was injured by Shi Ling Gou's hidden weapon.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.960
What kind of hidden weapon?

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:29.159
Your Majesty, Shi Ling Gou requests an audience.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.120
Summon him.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:30.840
Yes.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.039
Master.

00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:48.679
How did it go?

00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:51.120
The Young Duke injured the Qiang envoy.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.399
Now he's entering the palace safely.

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:54.639
What?

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.080
Your Majesty, I am honored not to have failed.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.679
The Qiang envoy was so frightened by me

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:01.440
he ran out of Hui Fang Suo in a panic.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.000
Rumor has it you used

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.879
a very unusual hidden weapon.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.559
Show us quickly.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.039
Your Majesty.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.759
If this weapon is mishandled,

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.320
it can be dangerous.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.000
Then we must see it even more.

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:14.879
Hurry, hurry!

00:12:21.159 --> 00:12:21.639
Ping'an.

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:36.240
From this far, can it really work?

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:39.080
Please step back a bit, Your Majesty.

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.200
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:41.720
Alright.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.559
Your Majesty, don't blink for what's next.
