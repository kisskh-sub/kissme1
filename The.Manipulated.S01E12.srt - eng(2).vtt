The Manipulated

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:22.229
What is this place?

00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:25.107
Actually, it used to belong to my mom.

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:27.609
Come in.

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:50.590
Why don't we do this at my shop?

00:01:50.674 --> 00:01:54.010
I doubt they'd come looking for us
in a place they already caught us.

00:01:56.888 --> 00:01:59.808
Unfortunately, they have bugs
and cameras all over your place.

00:02:00.392 --> 00:02:03.395
Wait, you found all these
planted at the store?

00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:06.440
I searched everywhere I could,
but there might still be more.

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:09.693
So I think it's better
if we stay here for now.

00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:11.570
Sure. I think that's a good idea.

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:13.447
All right.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.240
I'll get some things from the car.

00:02:15.323 --> 00:02:17.701
Wait. I have the keys. I'll go with you.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.955
Looks like everything is proceeding
according to plan, Young Master.

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.040
That's right.

00:03:05.123 --> 00:03:07.542
Now that Park Taejoong
has been taken care of,

00:03:07.626 --> 00:03:08.710
we can finally relax.

00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:12.672
But I have a feeling
that after tomorrow's auction,

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:15.383
things are going to get quite busy
for the artist Arleli.

00:03:15.467 --> 00:03:16.593
Is that so?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.182
Yes.

00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:25.310
Inmate 2802
hanged himself this morning.

00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:28.063
He's dead?

00:03:31.441 --> 00:03:33.068
Park Taejoong committed suicide?

00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:34.819
Seriously?

00:03:34.903 --> 00:03:36.947
Yes. I checked the body myself.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:42.953
Well, it sounds like you're in
a pretty tough situation, huh, Warden?

00:03:43.954 --> 00:03:45.997
-Am I right?
-You're right.

00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:48.750
So since he killed himself...

00:03:50.544 --> 00:03:51.711
Okay, I get it.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.427
Did you hear that?
I did what you told me to do.

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.726
Hey, I have a couple of gold bars.
You want one?

00:04:09.437 --> 00:04:12.148
He should at least answer
when someone talks to him.

00:04:12.232 --> 00:04:15.443
From now on,
everything you say is being recorded.

00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:21.241
We'd better get ready
to welcome our guest.

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:23.493
We're having a guest?

00:04:23.577 --> 00:04:25.662
Make sure to sweep and polish everything.

00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:28.164
Shall we throw a party?

00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:45.640
Baek Dokyung was right.

00:04:45.724 --> 00:04:48.727
The murders all took place
within ten days of the auction.

00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:52.397
And the police were able to catch
all of the culprits within a week.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.483
That's exactly like
what happened in Taejoong's case.

00:04:56.818 --> 00:04:58.987
So then these sculptures were...

00:05:00.488 --> 00:05:01.656
That's right.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.034
They were payment
to cover up the murder cases.

00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:07.245
That miserable jerk.

00:05:09.414 --> 00:05:10.707
And this one here...

00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.460
is mine.

00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:15.795
Those assholes are sick.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.131
That's insane.

00:05:18.214 --> 00:05:19.591
How could a person do that?

00:05:20.258 --> 00:05:21.259
Shit.

00:05:22.135 --> 00:05:24.179
The auction is tomorrow.

00:05:25.472 --> 00:05:26.890
Park Taejoong.

00:05:27.724 --> 00:05:29.517
You need to make that bastard pay.

00:05:29.601 --> 00:05:32.354
Yes, that's right.
You gotta hit him hard this time.

00:05:32.437 --> 00:05:34.648
Show no mercy. Just crush him, Taejoong.

00:05:37.734 --> 00:05:39.694
ARLELI'S "WAILING SERIES" SETS RECORD

00:05:42.864 --> 00:05:44.908
I'm gonna step out for a little while.

00:05:44.991 --> 00:05:47.661
Yeah, okay.
Hey, just be careful.

00:06:05.595 --> 00:06:08.765
Hello. We're from the Office
of the Inspector General.

00:06:08.848 --> 00:06:10.684
Oh. You're here early.

00:06:10.767 --> 00:06:12.227
You're Officer Yang Cheolhwan?

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.853
Yes. Now let's see.

00:06:13.937 --> 00:06:17.399
I tried to organize the evidence materials
in my own way.

00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:19.901
Hey, what is this? What's going on?

00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:22.696
We received reports of bribes
from inmates. Come with us.

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:24.030
What are you talking about?

00:06:24.114 --> 00:06:25.448
- Wait a minute!
- Hey!

00:06:25.532 --> 00:06:27.951
You should've just
taken me up on my offer.

00:06:28.034 --> 00:06:30.286
What? Hang on! Let me go! You...

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.621
What the hell did you do?

00:06:31.705 --> 00:06:34.457
-Let go, damn it!
-Close the door behind you.

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:38.461
AUCTION AND EXHIBITION
FOR ARLELI'S 100TH SCULPTURE

00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:42.674
TAKES PLACE ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 6TH
AT MIRAE ART GALLERY

00:06:53.351 --> 00:06:55.895
ARLELI'S "NO. 100" EXPECTED
TO BREAK AUCTION RECORD

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:59.899
The Manipulated

00:07:46.946 --> 00:07:48.239
How are you feeling?

00:07:48.948 --> 00:07:50.158
Hard to say.

00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:52.869
I'll know for sure once this is over.

00:07:52.952 --> 00:07:55.914
All you need to focus on right now
is enjoying yourself.

00:07:55.997 --> 00:07:57.540
Yeah, of course.

00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:12.639
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will now begin our auction

00:08:12.722 --> 00:08:16.142
for the 100th piece
by renowned artist Arleli.

00:08:16.226 --> 00:08:19.187
Now, given the special significance
of this 100th work,

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.940
we will open bidding at 6.1 billion won

00:08:22.023 --> 00:08:24.484
with further increments
of 300 million won.

00:08:24.567 --> 00:08:27.612
I'm going to outbid everyone
and buy that sculpture.

00:08:27.695 --> 00:08:29.155
You have a lot of confidence.

00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:31.074
...at 6.1 billion won.

00:08:31.157 --> 00:08:32.700
6.1 billion.

00:08:32.784 --> 00:08:34.202
We have 6.1 billion.

00:08:34.285 --> 00:08:35.495
6.4 billion.

00:08:35.578 --> 00:08:38.498
We have 6.4 billion won
from a guest in the private room.

00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:40.333
Do I hear 6.7?

00:08:40.416 --> 00:08:41.793
We have 6.7 billion.

00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:43.545
6.7 billion accepted.

00:08:43.628 --> 00:08:44.963
Do I hear seven billion?

00:08:45.046 --> 00:08:46.172
We have seven billion.

00:08:46.256 --> 00:08:48.967
The guest in the center of the room
bid seven billion.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.761
We're now going to raise
the bid increment to 500 million.

00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:53.888
Do I hear 7.5 billion?

00:08:53.972 --> 00:08:55.056
7.5 billion.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.183
We have 7.5 billion won.

00:08:57.267 --> 00:08:58.393
7.5 billion.

00:08:58.476 --> 00:09:00.562
We're now at eight billion.
Eight billion won.

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:02.188
Do we have eight billion?

00:09:02.272 --> 00:09:03.606
Eight billion?

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.901
Yes. We have a bid for eight billion
from someone in the private room.

00:09:06.985 --> 00:09:09.195
Eight billion is now the highest bid.

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:13.324
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now increase
the bidding increment to one billion won.

00:09:13.408 --> 00:09:14.784
Do I hear nine billion?

00:09:15.827 --> 00:09:19.289
A guest at the back of the room
has just made a bid for nine billion won.

00:09:19.372 --> 00:09:20.832
Nine billion is the highest bid.

00:09:20.915 --> 00:09:22.959
That means we're now
asking for ten billion.

00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:24.043
Ten billion won.

00:09:24.127 --> 00:09:26.546
We're checking both online
and in this room.

00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:30.341
We're asking for ten billion from
the guest in the private room right now.

00:09:30.425 --> 00:09:32.135
Nine billion won is the highest bid.

00:09:32.218 --> 00:09:34.012
Going once, going twice...

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.556
We now have ten billion.

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:39.517
The guest in the private room
has made a bid for ten billion.

00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:42.145
That's ten billion
for the artist Arleli's 100th work.

00:09:43.813 --> 00:09:46.524
It seems that someone else
is also after this piece.

00:09:47.108 --> 00:09:48.193
I think you're right.

00:09:48.276 --> 00:09:51.279
But my friend here can't buy it
when he has no money.

00:09:51.362 --> 00:09:52.655
Your friend, huh?

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:56.367
Ten billion going once, going twice...

00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:58.578
Sold!

00:09:58.661 --> 00:10:00.830
The artist Arleli's 100th work

00:10:00.914 --> 00:10:03.791
goes to the guest in the private room
for ten billion won.

00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:05.084
Congratulations.

00:10:05.168 --> 00:10:07.879
Now I'm sure that many of you
are extremely curious

00:10:07.962 --> 00:10:10.006
about the identity of the artist.

00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:12.300
And today Arleli will finally be revealed.

00:10:12.383 --> 00:10:15.887
We will now hold a special ceremony,
and Arleli will personally present

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.972
their 100th work to the winning bidder.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.935
Arleli, please come to the stage
and reveal yourself.

00:10:26.439 --> 00:10:27.899
Arleli, are we here?

00:10:27.982 --> 00:10:29.609
Please come to the stage.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.524
Long time no see, friend.

00:11:15.989 --> 00:11:17.699
Oh, fuck me.

00:11:18.533 --> 00:11:19.617
Don't kill me.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.288
-You want to live?
-Yes please. I really do.

00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:25.665
There's something I need you to do for me.

00:11:26.874 --> 00:11:30.003
You thought I'd just drop dead, huh?
You motherfucker.

00:11:40.763 --> 00:11:41.889
Are you An Yohan?

00:11:41.973 --> 00:11:44.434
An Yohan, you're under arrest for murder,

00:11:44.517 --> 00:11:47.228
aiding and abetting murders,
and destruction of evidence.

00:11:47.312 --> 00:11:49.480
- What the hell?
- Back off!

00:11:49.564 --> 00:11:52.525
You have the right to an attorney
and to have your defense heard.

00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:58.698
That's right,
you son of a bitch.

00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:00.199
Now you're totally fucked.

00:12:00.783 --> 00:12:03.703
You killed my father too,
didn't you, asshole?

00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:11.544
I'll take care of all this, don't worry.

00:12:11.627 --> 00:12:13.046
For now, just call our friend.

00:12:13.129 --> 00:12:14.756
Yes, Young Master, I will.

00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:38.029
Put him in the car. Come on.

00:12:46.746 --> 00:12:48.373
Inmate 1055.

00:12:53.878 --> 00:12:56.047
AUCTION AND WINNING BID

00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:08.476
Taejoong. That bastard got arrested
at the auction.

00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:11.187
He'll probably be out soon.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.772
Huh?

00:13:12.855 --> 00:13:15.775
All the guys that hired
that piece of shit, they're at the top.

00:13:15.858 --> 00:13:17.985
I'm sure they're well connected
to the police.

00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:20.780
-You mean the ones buying the sculptures?
-Yeah.

00:13:21.656 --> 00:13:24.117
Then we're never gonna be able
to take this guy down.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.329
If we want to catch him, then we have to
secure all of the evidence that he has.

00:13:28.413 --> 00:13:29.997
And today is our only chance.

00:13:30.081 --> 00:13:31.332
-I gotta head out.
-Okay.

00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:33.543
Just be careful.

00:13:47.265 --> 00:13:48.349
It's all in here.

00:13:49.142 --> 00:13:50.393
Check it out.

00:13:51.727 --> 00:13:53.354
You are aware that if you do this,

00:13:53.437 --> 00:13:55.398
you'll no longer have
any legal protection.

00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:58.401
I know. I don't give a shit
about that anymore.

00:13:58.484 --> 00:14:01.195
I want that son of a bitch
to pay for what he did.

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:03.072
Shit! This fucking hurts.

00:14:03.156 --> 00:14:04.198
Am I done yet?

00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:08.411
I need a rest. Doctor's orders.

00:14:17.587 --> 00:14:19.463
Ah, son of a bitch!

00:14:45.948 --> 00:14:49.160
When you show up, call this number
and the staff will guide you.

00:14:52.538 --> 00:14:54.207
Okay, I'll head over right now.

00:14:57.293 --> 00:14:58.836
I'll finish everything up here.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.671
Go protect the Young Master.

00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:02.298
Understood.

00:15:35.581 --> 00:15:36.749
Sorry about this.

00:15:36.832 --> 00:15:38.209
Sorry. Our car's broken down.

00:15:38.292 --> 00:15:39.543
We'll try to get it moving.

00:15:39.627 --> 00:15:41.254
Are you kidding me?

00:15:41.337 --> 00:15:43.339
You can't just stop your car in the road.

00:15:43.422 --> 00:15:45.716
We're probably gonna
have to call a tow truck.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.468
We appreciate your patience.

00:15:47.551 --> 00:15:49.637
-Thank you.
-We'll get it checked out later.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.806
Should've gotten it checked beforehand.

00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:04.860
You all right on your own?

00:16:04.944 --> 00:16:06.529
Just hurry back to your dad.

00:16:06.612 --> 00:16:07.613
Why?

00:16:07.697 --> 00:16:10.700
I know that asshole
is gonna track you down next.

00:16:10.783 --> 00:16:14.161
So go quickly
and stay by his side tonight.

00:16:14.745 --> 00:16:16.706
Call me if anything happens to you, okay?

00:16:17.707 --> 00:16:18.708
All right.

00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:20.418
Just be careful.

00:16:50.114 --> 00:16:51.615
Hey, man.

00:16:51.699 --> 00:16:53.659
Do you think you could lend me some money?

00:16:53.743 --> 00:16:55.911
I'm hungry, but the food here is terrible.

00:16:55.995 --> 00:16:58.122
I want to order something good.

00:16:58.205 --> 00:16:59.373
Come on. What do you say?

00:17:01.083 --> 00:17:04.211
I'm afraid I don't have the time.

00:17:04.295 --> 00:17:07.256
Whatever.

00:17:47.088 --> 00:17:48.714
Tell your men I work for you.

00:17:48.798 --> 00:17:51.258
Tell them we're on the same side!

00:17:59.141 --> 00:18:02.311
Man, this police station
is a real shithole.

00:18:09.902 --> 00:18:11.320
No, no, please!

00:18:18.452 --> 00:18:19.537
Is this gonna work?

00:18:20.121 --> 00:18:21.455
Oh, don't you worry.

00:18:22.164 --> 00:18:23.290
This wasn't about you.

00:18:23.374 --> 00:18:25.626
The guys who broke in here
and started shit

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.130
were just here to get their buddies
out of jail.

00:18:29.213 --> 00:18:32.091
You, my friend, were merely a bystander.

00:18:35.261 --> 00:18:41.225
And when you saw them storming in,
you got scared and ran, simple as that.

00:18:42.852 --> 00:18:43.936
That's a good idea.

00:18:45.354 --> 00:18:46.731
Now, what do you want?

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.901
The warden told me that if I scratched
your back, you'd scratch mine.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.155
Park Taejoong.

00:18:54.864 --> 00:18:56.365
I want to know where he is.

00:19:00.035 --> 00:19:01.370
I'll make it work for you.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.847
All right, let's get to work.
Finish it off and take pictures.

00:19:21.974 --> 00:19:23.225
All right.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.811
How do you want it done?

00:19:25.895 --> 00:19:27.855
The way you always do it.

00:20:00.846 --> 00:20:02.181
Careful with that.

00:20:02.264 --> 00:20:04.099
Take that to the end of the hall.

00:20:15.611 --> 00:20:17.279
Yeah, a little to the left.

00:20:18.614 --> 00:20:20.658
A little more... Okay.

00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:27.832
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

00:20:40.386 --> 00:20:41.554
Huh?

00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:43.722
She got here pretty fast.

00:20:44.765 --> 00:20:45.766
Eunbi.

00:20:56.735 --> 00:20:58.279
You were hiding here?

00:21:28.642 --> 00:21:29.727
Hey, Dad?

00:21:31.562 --> 00:21:32.646
Are you here?

00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:35.232
Hey!

00:21:35.316 --> 00:21:37.693
- Papa?
- Smile.

00:21:40.696 --> 00:21:42.698
Stop it!

00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:45.993
Don't worry.

00:21:46.076 --> 00:21:47.620
I'll get your picture too.

00:22:08.015 --> 00:22:09.183
Ah, poor guy.

00:22:09.266 --> 00:22:11.435
You weren't much of a son, were you?

00:22:12.311 --> 00:22:15.564
When you meet your father,
show some respect, would you?

00:22:24.907 --> 00:22:26.283
You fucking crazy bitch!

00:22:50.516 --> 00:22:52.977
Eunbi, just go.

00:22:54.061 --> 00:22:55.104
Eunbi.

00:22:57.648 --> 00:22:59.274
Run, now!

00:23:08.701 --> 00:23:10.577
Aw.

00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:13.038
What a terrible daughter!

00:23:13.122 --> 00:23:15.332
She runs off and leaves
her own father behind.

00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:21.922
Eunbi.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.443
I'm coming, I'm coming!

00:23:42.526 --> 00:23:43.527
Dad!

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.407
Papa, are you okay?

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.200
Hang on, stay with me!

00:23:50.284 --> 00:23:52.619
I called 911. They're on their way.

00:23:52.703 --> 00:23:55.122
Papa.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.584
Papa!

00:23:58.667 --> 00:24:00.002
Let's wrap it up.

00:24:29.448 --> 00:24:31.075
This has been a lot of fun.

00:24:31.158 --> 00:24:33.202
I admit, I find you fascinating.

00:24:33.786 --> 00:24:35.788
How about we finally end this?

00:24:35.871 --> 00:24:37.289
I'll invite you to my house.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.876
That's not necessary.

00:24:43.962 --> 00:24:45.047
You're there already?

00:24:46.381 --> 00:24:47.841
You're in quite a rush, huh?

00:24:55.766 --> 00:24:57.101
Hey, you still having fun?

00:24:59.603 --> 00:25:00.938
Come on, say something.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.109
Wait. I'll be right there.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.215
You're finished.

00:25:30.092 --> 00:25:32.261
Get out of the fucking way, asshole.

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:36.473
Move it!

00:25:50.612 --> 00:25:51.864
Oh, shit!

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.023
Good to see you.

00:26:26.106 --> 00:26:28.609
I thought you'd try to sneak in
from the outside,

00:26:29.443 --> 00:26:31.945
but instead you came out from the inside.

00:26:33.864 --> 00:26:35.449
Park Taejoong.

00:26:37.868 --> 00:26:43.081
From this day forward,
I have decided to believe in God.

00:26:44.166 --> 00:26:47.294
You see, I prayed for the day

00:26:48.545 --> 00:26:50.631
that I'd be able to see you again.

00:26:51.798 --> 00:26:53.383
And here you are.

00:27:00.641 --> 00:27:01.934
Hallelujah.

00:27:02.017 --> 00:27:03.101
So what do you think?

00:27:03.185 --> 00:27:05.896
Did I bring enough men?

00:27:07.731 --> 00:27:09.316
Park Taejoong...

00:27:09.942 --> 00:27:11.235
Let's end this today.

00:27:11.777 --> 00:27:13.237
Kill him now!

00:29:42.594 --> 00:29:43.887
Shit.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.479
You know, you could have been pretty rich
if you just took the check.

00:29:55.565 --> 00:29:57.359
It's too bad the owner's dead now.

00:30:00.487 --> 00:30:03.073
What are you doing
snooping around in my house?

00:30:09.162 --> 00:30:10.163
You want a drink?

00:30:10.247 --> 00:30:13.041
Oh, that's right.
You're more of a vitamin guy.

00:30:13.959 --> 00:30:17.087
By tomorrow morning,
the world will know everything.

00:30:19.089 --> 00:30:21.299
And they'll see
just what a monster you are.

00:30:24.719 --> 00:30:27.305
So you went into my room
and you stole the evidence, huh?

00:30:28.056 --> 00:30:31.226
Wow. I didn't realize
you were such a cunning person.

00:30:31.935 --> 00:30:34.020
You always seemed so impulsive to me.

00:30:46.825 --> 00:30:47.909
It's right here.

00:30:47.993 --> 00:30:51.037
Everything you're after, it's all in here.

00:30:52.247 --> 00:30:56.251
Now, the hard drive you took
will wipe itself clean if you open it.

00:30:56.334 --> 00:30:58.503
I knew you'd be coming,
so I set everything up.

00:30:58.587 --> 00:30:59.963
A guest will come. Let him in.

00:31:02.632 --> 00:31:05.635
-He showed up, sir.
-You know I hate talking to myself.

00:31:05.719 --> 00:31:07.387
Why is it you never answer me?

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.097
Are you rude or just stupid?

00:31:11.433 --> 00:31:13.143
I guess we're done talking.

00:31:22.986 --> 00:31:24.279
Drop the knife.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.038
You're out of options.

00:31:33.622 --> 00:31:34.706
You're finished.

00:31:36.291 --> 00:31:37.459
Wait.

00:31:37.542 --> 00:31:39.377
I have a better idea, actually.

00:31:41.546 --> 00:31:42.589
Finish him off.

00:31:43.256 --> 00:31:46.092
As long as he's alive,
he'll never stop hunting you.

00:31:46.843 --> 00:31:48.053
You know that.

00:31:48.136 --> 00:31:49.763
So why not just kill him now?

00:31:49.846 --> 00:31:51.556
If you do that, I'll let her live.

00:32:04.027 --> 00:32:05.904
You evil fucking bastard.

00:32:19.542 --> 00:32:20.669
Just let her go.

00:32:21.378 --> 00:32:22.712
She wasn't involved.

00:32:26.216 --> 00:32:27.717
Yeah.

00:32:27.801 --> 00:32:29.928
You're incapable of being a bad guy.

00:32:30.845 --> 00:32:32.764
Always caring for others.

00:32:32.847 --> 00:32:35.141
Can't even let a sick plant die.

00:32:53.618 --> 00:32:54.619
Look at this.

00:32:54.703 --> 00:32:56.579
This is my 100th work.

00:32:56.663 --> 00:32:58.415
Does it remind you of anyone?

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.088
That's right, Taejoong.

00:33:05.714 --> 00:33:09.092
After I kill you,
this girl's gonna take the blame.

00:33:42.334 --> 00:33:43.877
Aren't you here to kill me?

00:33:44.627 --> 00:33:46.004
What are you waiting for?

00:34:35.512 --> 00:34:36.763
Look around you.

00:34:36.846 --> 00:34:39.099
This is the place
where I ruined your life.

00:34:50.235 --> 00:34:52.153
It's also where I killed your brother.

00:35:32.068 --> 00:35:35.572
You stupid bastard.

00:35:36.614 --> 00:35:38.616
Do it. Come on!

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.701
Just kill me!

00:35:51.087 --> 00:35:52.088
You...

00:35:53.214 --> 00:35:54.424
You ruined my life.

00:35:55.759 --> 00:35:56.885
And you killed Taejin.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.138
You should die.

00:36:04.142 --> 00:36:05.143
However...

00:36:07.437 --> 00:36:09.522
if I kill you, will that change anything?

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.860
Cut the crap and finish it.

00:36:17.322 --> 00:36:18.865
No, you don't deserve that.

00:36:27.207 --> 00:36:28.541
Wait! No, kill me!

00:36:29.292 --> 00:36:31.503
I said kill me, you asshole!

00:36:32.295 --> 00:36:34.506
Don't walk away from me!

00:36:35.715 --> 00:36:36.758
Kill me!

00:36:36.841 --> 00:36:40.220
Do it!

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:42.764
Kill me!

00:36:43.389 --> 00:36:45.350
Hurry up and kill me!

00:36:46.643 --> 00:36:47.936
Stay alive no matter what...

00:36:49.938 --> 00:36:51.606
and pay for everything you did.

00:36:51.689 --> 00:36:52.899
Kill me!

00:37:40.363 --> 00:37:41.990
AN YOHAN FOUND DEAD
AT SCENE OF FIRE

00:37:42.073 --> 00:37:45.034
It has been revealed
that the famous sculptor An Yohan,

00:37:45.118 --> 00:37:47.912
who died in a fire last week,
was receiving huge sums of money

00:37:47.996 --> 00:37:51.332
to fabricate real life murder cases
involving high-ranking public figures.

00:37:51.416 --> 00:37:53.418
Payments were made
for the buying and selling

00:37:53.501 --> 00:37:55.795
of his own sculptures
at exclusive art auctions.

00:37:55.879 --> 00:37:58.381
In exchange, he'd conceal
the identity of the murderer

00:37:58.464 --> 00:38:00.675
and frame someone innocent in their place.

00:38:00.758 --> 00:38:03.219
This was brought to light
by an anonymous whistleblower

00:38:03.303 --> 00:38:05.221
and the confession
of a corrections officer

00:38:05.305 --> 00:38:06.890
who were connected to the scheme.

00:38:06.973 --> 00:38:09.267
Reporters are questioning
if the whistleblower...

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:10.768
Yeah, Dad?

00:38:10.852 --> 00:38:12.395
Did you call me?

00:38:12.478 --> 00:38:14.981
...and whether they could have
issues down the line.

00:38:15.064 --> 00:38:16.524
What?

00:38:18.902 --> 00:38:20.445
Taejoong.

00:38:24.032 --> 00:38:25.533
I'll call him.

00:38:25.617 --> 00:38:27.160
Hold on a sec.

00:38:27.243 --> 00:38:30.204
Retrials will begin
for all of the framed victims

00:38:30.288 --> 00:38:33.458
and are currently serving time
in connection with the An case.

00:38:33.541 --> 00:38:36.669
Relief measures such as
release and pardon will be arranged...

00:38:36.753 --> 00:38:38.838
The court finds that not only is there

00:38:38.922 --> 00:38:41.591
insufficient evidence
to prove these charges,

00:38:41.674 --> 00:38:44.677
but it is also clear that the defendant,
Park Taejoong,

00:38:44.761 --> 00:38:48.556
was completely unrelated to this crime
and is himself a victim

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.975
of a serious human rights violation.

00:38:51.059 --> 00:38:55.229
Accordingly, pursuant to Article 325
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

00:38:55.313 --> 00:38:57.690
the court hereby renders
the following verdict:

00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:01.569
The defendant, Park Taejoong...

00:39:02.946 --> 00:39:04.030
is not guilty.

00:39:33.309 --> 00:39:35.853
LATE SHIN JIYOUNG
LATE PARK TAEJIN

00:40:15.226 --> 00:40:17.979
6 MONTHS LATER

00:40:26.154 --> 00:40:27.822
Is that heavy? Just be careful.

00:40:27.905 --> 00:40:29.741
Okay, okay. I know. I saw it.

00:40:30.783 --> 00:40:31.868
All right.

00:40:34.078 --> 00:40:37.331
These guys are so much easier to raise
than you might think.

00:40:37.415 --> 00:40:38.583
They don't need a lot.

00:40:39.417 --> 00:40:41.419
You just pull this guy out like this...

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.921
and you put it in here...

00:40:44.672 --> 00:40:45.757
like this.

00:40:49.635 --> 00:40:50.636
What's wrong?

00:40:51.888 --> 00:40:53.014
Nothing.

00:40:53.097 --> 00:40:54.682
Keep doing what you were doing.

00:40:55.475 --> 00:40:58.102
It's nice
to see you like this.

00:41:01.689 --> 00:41:03.816
Oh. You said no water.

00:41:04.692 --> 00:41:05.985
Hey, Taejoong!

00:41:08.237 --> 00:41:09.447
Look who's here.

00:41:13.826 --> 00:41:14.869
Oh.

00:41:15.953 --> 00:41:17.497
Hey.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.582
What are you doing all the way out here?

00:41:19.665 --> 00:41:21.667
I said I'd meet you somewhere better.

00:41:22.668 --> 00:41:23.920
You opened your shop.

00:41:24.003 --> 00:41:25.046
Congratulations.

00:41:25.755 --> 00:41:26.839
Here.

00:41:27.965 --> 00:41:29.884
This is the one you looked after.

00:41:29.967 --> 00:41:31.135
It's grown quite a bit.

00:41:32.386 --> 00:41:34.597
Thank you, Officer Yang.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:37.475
It's Yang Cheolhwan.

00:41:38.392 --> 00:41:39.560
You can say my name.

00:41:49.695 --> 00:41:51.072
Here you are. Excuse me.

00:41:51.155 --> 00:41:52.698
-Oh, thank you.
-Please enjoy.

00:41:53.449 --> 00:41:55.159
Hello. Come right this way.

00:41:55.243 --> 00:41:56.828
-Over here. Yes?
-Excuse me.

00:41:56.911 --> 00:41:59.038
-Can I get another slice of cake?
-Same one?

00:41:59.122 --> 00:42:00.581
-That would be great.
-Will do.

00:42:16.347 --> 00:42:17.640
Thanks. Have a good night.

00:42:17.723 --> 00:42:19.142
- Come again.
- Of course.

00:42:20.893 --> 00:42:22.770
Let's wrap things up and call it a day.

00:42:22.854 --> 00:42:24.105
Here.

00:42:24.188 --> 00:42:26.566
-Hey, I'll take care of that.
-We have to clean this.

00:42:26.649 --> 00:42:28.276
-Give it to me.
-Okay.

00:42:29.026 --> 00:42:31.529
-Are there a lot of dishes?
-Don't worry, I got it.

00:42:31.612 --> 00:42:34.574
All right. The sooner we finish,
the sooner we can eat.
