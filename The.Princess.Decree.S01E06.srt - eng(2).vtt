(Yuanze, bad news.)

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.959
(Gan Sheng comes in fierce.)

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.159
(He has begun to search for
Mrs. Liu and Zhao.)

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.599
(I'm also being suppressed at court.)

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.490
(I beg you to find the draft
as soon as possible)

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.599
(and return to court)

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:43.840
(to take charge.)

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.560
(Princess Royal Yongan's Residence)

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.200
Your Highness, we found
Liu Zhen's widow and her young grandson

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.640
are hiding in Apricot Blossom Lane

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.220
at the far end of a house
in the south of the city.

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:02.860
Gan Sheng's men have already gone there.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.799
We must deal with them
before Gan Sheng arrives.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.400
Do it cleanly.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.759
Leave no trace.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.319
Yes.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:12.560
Dead?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.360
Yes.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.680
Who did it?

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.880
The work is clean. Doesn't seem
to have been dealt by ordinary people.

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:21.039
Who in this capital

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.520
have such skill?

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.520
I do know one person.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.879
You're a busy man.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.840
What brings you here?

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.159
I found something amusing

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.000
in the city recently,

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.280
so I thought of showing it to you.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.680
Don't panic, Your Highness.

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.560
Why not call Li Yuanze?

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.560
We can enjoy it together.

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.240
Official Li, please.

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:11.879
Since everyone's here,

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.280
bring it up.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.039
Official Li.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.199
Take a good look.

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.560
Does this corpse

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.400
look familiar?

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.319
This is Mr. Liu's jade.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.480
Mrs. Liu.

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:44.680
Zhao!

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.160
Since Official Li has confirmed it,

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:03.199
it seems

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:04.759
there's no mistake.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.079
Though the bodies

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:07.720
were soaked beyond recognition,

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:09.680
their age and build

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:12.199
match Liu Zhen's family.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.680
Your Highness.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.360
I was searching for these two.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.439
I was close to finding them,

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.720
yet they died.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.040
Their faces are also unrecognizable.

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:31.879
Is this

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.839
your doing?

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.160
What if it is?

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.240
I only killed two people.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.800
Must I seek your approval?

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.319
Why say so?

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.920
I only fear

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.639
to stain your hands.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.519
After all, killing

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.360
is my specialty.

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:28.680
Is that so?

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.839
Then you should have acted before me,

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:32.879
not question me here.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.519
You're right.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.120
But

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.800
according to the law,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.399
an official's crime
spares the elderly and the young.

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.240
Your act

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.800
may stir debate.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.720
The law has nothing to do with me.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.519
I hate Liu Zhen to the bone.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.000
How could I spare his family?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.560
Since they're Liu Zhen's family,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.439
they deserve to lose their lives.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:03.680
You two.

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:06.360
Why bring these filthy things
before me again?

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.639
Take them away.

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:08.639
Who dares?

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:19.560
Zhou Cheng.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.160
Let's go.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.600
General.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.319
Are we just going to leave?

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:43.800
Won't it be too easy for them?

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.360
This thorn

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.360
leaves no chance for them

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.160
to mend things.

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:10.319
I've seen

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:14.879

Your Highness.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.000
He won't be in danger, right?

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:01.120
Find him an imperial physician.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.360
His life is mine.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.480
He cannot die

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:07.080
without my say.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:14.700
♪Falling blooms pale before your smile♪

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.840
Your Highness.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.639
The imperial physician said
Official Li was caught in rain

00:10:31.639 --> 00:10:32.759
and already fell ill.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.960
Grief worsened it, hurting his heart.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.200
He needs medicine immediately,

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:37.580
but he won't drink a drop.

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:42.919
I want to see

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:45.480
if he's really set on dying.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.320
Who let you in?

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.879
So this is the act

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:29.279
you put on beside me.

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:37.840
I should have burned it.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.360
Seems like you still don't know me.

00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:49.480
When I topped the exam,

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:50.799
Mr. Liu praised me

00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:52.320
not only for fine writing,

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.120
but also for my photographic memory.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.600
Each word and punctuation inside

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:05.559
is etched in my mind.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.039
To destroy it fully,

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:09.679
you must kill me.

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:13.559
Do you really think

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:16.039
I won't kill you?

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.840
It's not that you won't,

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:22.639
you can't anymore.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.879
Li Yuanze, don't you dare.

00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:36.600
Today,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.799
if you take one step out,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.720
you'll bear the consequences!

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.910
I should have taken this step long ago.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.630
If I hadn't held hope for you,

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.120
I wouldn't have made such a mistake.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.670
Thank you

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.270
for giving me that final push.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.240
Someone,

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.630
stop him for me.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.000
The Empress Dowager's decree
has arrived.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.790
The Empress Dowager has issued an edict.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.390
(Eunuch Feng, Empress's Attendant)
Former Vice Minister Li Yuanze

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.000

and capable.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.480
Recommended by the ministers,

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.390
he can uphold his mentor's legacy.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.960
He is hereby promoted
as Grand Secretary,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.320
overseeing all state affairs.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.670
So decreed.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.670
I

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:17.790
accept the decree.
