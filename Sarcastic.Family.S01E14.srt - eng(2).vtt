00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.560
Buying all sorts of random stuff again.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.319
What random stuff?

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.639
Meng Hang is throwing me a birthday.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.439
Shouldn't I show my appreciation?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.199
A return gift, right?

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.639
Meng Hang will wear this for the birthday?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.039
I meant myself.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.840
I need to show I care.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.240
Attend in style.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.639
You all have too much free time.

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.400
We never celebrated birthdays back home.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.400
Yeah, that's why I'm not living there now.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.560
Now you're at my place.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560
We do celebrate here.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.479
Do they have a custom on Earth

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.919
where kids give their mom a red envelope on their birthday?

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.960
After all, it's my

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.120
day of suffering.

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.479
What suffering did you go through?

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:46.919
I was hatched by a machine.

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.599
Besides,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.759
all these years,

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.680
I've suffered plenty with you.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.319
You never gave me a red envelope.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.360
Technically,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.280
you should get me a birthday present.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.639
I can't attend your birthday.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.479
I've got plans.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.919
Do you even know my birthday?

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.319
Whatever day it is, I'm busy.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.639
This color—

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.599
Only I can pull it off.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.879
Mom.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.080
Mom.

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:01.400
Mom.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.719
Mom, what's wrong?

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.599
Quick, throw that thing far away!

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.240
What's wrong with it?

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.120
My neck—

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.919
Contact with synthetics poisons me.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:15.639
Did you forget?

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.759
You didn't even tell me it's synthetic.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.360
I didn't forget.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.600
I had no idea.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.839
My head hurts.

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.480
My head hurts.

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:35.319
Are you okay?

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:46.040
Good thing you're here.

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:48.360
Otherwise,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.480
I'd still be lying on the floor.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.000
You didn't help me up.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.079
Headache.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.920
I didn't know what was wrong.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.519
I didn't dare move you.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.920
Good kid.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:10.680
Help your mom up.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.079
Mom.

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:15.920
Or maybe

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.199
you could move around yourself?

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.879
I'm afraid you'll blame me.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.199
This kid...

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:25.120
My head really hurts.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.879
I saw that first aid video.

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:33.079
You shouldn't stand up.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.480
My baby girl is so thoughtful.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.600
I'm fine now.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.519
Go do your thing.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.759
Mom, you—

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.839
Are you sure you're okay?

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.240
In a bit,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.040
I'm going to the bank

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:57.839
to withdraw some money.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.360
What for?

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.600
Didn't you

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.680
want a birthday present?

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.160
I don't know what you like.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.399
I'll just give you a red envelope.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.199
Wait—

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.879
Mom, you—

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:13.839
Don't scare me.

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:15.240
I'm really fine.

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:16.480
See?

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.920
My arms and legs aren't hurt at all.

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.639
Alright, you've been busy all day.

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:22.920
Go get some rest.

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.959
I'm off to cook for my baby girl.

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.079
Wait a second.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.600
What did you just say?

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:32.839
Going to cook for you.

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.920
Not that—before that.

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.680
What did you call me?

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.800
Baby girl.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.839
You didn't see it.

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:51.920
It was terrifying.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.839
My mom doesn't even recognize me now.

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:56.120
She calls me baby.

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:57.519
Sis.

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:58.959
Don't worry too much now.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.399
It'll get scarier later.

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:03.519
Why did you two bring me here?

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:06.319
I've got rice simmering on the stove.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.240
Cai Yi, didn't you get hurt?

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.680
So you can't go to the hospital.

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:10.600
I'm right here.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.519
We'll get someone to check you out.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.600
Come on, Cai Yi.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.800
Close your eyes, let me take a look.

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:30.519
Alright, open your mouth.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.639
Do you know what you're doing?

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.680
On my home planet, I have a double degree in medicine and law.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.360
Double degree?

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:41.120
Medicine and law?

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.319
So if you kill a patient,

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:44.680
you can handle your own lawsuit.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.199
No need to trouble anyone else.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:48.079
All done.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.199
Miracle doctor! Miracle doctor!

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.399
All better in an instant.

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:52.839
My head hurts.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.879
This young man is really nice.

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:04.240
He looks good, and he's a good person.

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:05.199
How old is he?

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.879
Does he have a girlfriend?

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.800
Li Li

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.560
What's the name of your friend again?

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.519
It's gotten worse again.

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:11.199
Take another look.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:11.920
Let me check again.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.600
Come on, open your mouth.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.639
Looks like a strained back.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.720
Strained back.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:19.399
Right.

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:21.480
How can her personality change?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.439
It's the strained back.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.079
It also pressed on a nerve

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:25.480
that goes straight to the brain.

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.399
It can cause a big personality shift.

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:29.160
It can also come with

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.639
mild memory loss.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.159
But you don't need to worry.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.480
After midnight tonight,

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.039
it'll recover on its own.

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:36.879
So this personality change,

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:37.919
how drastic can it get?

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.519
Compared to before,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.759
it'll make a three hundred sixty degree turn.

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:43.240
Three hundred sixty degrees?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.639
Wouldn't that mean no change?

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:45.440
Yeah.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.639
I meant one eighty.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.919
Anyway, someone who was really nice before

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:51.360
will become really nasty.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.240
So someone like my mom,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.519
she's just a warm-hearted person.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.960
Brother Meng

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:14.440
What did you call me?

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.919
Brother Meng.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.159
I'm going grocery shopping.

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:18.799
What do you want for dinner?

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:20.240
I'll cook for you, okay?

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:25.360
What are you doing?

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.120
Sorry, sorry.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.320
I'm late.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.200
It's because

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.080
I washed all your sheets and covers.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.960
So it took some extra time.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.080
You aren't mad at me, are you?

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:39.679
I get it.

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:40.919
Look, look, look.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.519
What did I tell you yesterday?

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.320
Yesterday, we saw a weasel in the yard.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.559
I told you, don't step on it.

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:46.320
But you did.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:46.759
See?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.200
That must've been Huang Daxian.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.799
It stole your soul.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.879
What are you talking about?

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:55.440
Co-in-law, co-in-law.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.679
You have to hang in there.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.879
I know a master.

00:09:58.039 --> 00:09:58.919
He'll definitely have a way.

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:02.559
I, I, I...

00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:03.759
I'll go to Wudang Mountain.

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:04.639
You must hold on.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.919
You must hold on.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.559
You must hold on, co-in-law.

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:09.600
Brother Meng

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.000
I'll wait for you.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.279
Come back for dinner.

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:23.440
So much food!

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:24.279
Mom

00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:26.320
That's enough, we can't finish it.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.559
My son-in-law works all day, running to several communities.

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:32.399
It's so tiring for him.

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:33.399
He needs a good meal.

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:34.679
Mom, what's wrong?

00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:35.960
I feel bad for you.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.799
You're not sick, are you?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.759
You're the one who's sick.

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:43.320
Head.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.080
Mom made these dishes.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.039
Tell me if they're too salty or bland.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.159
I'll pay attention next time.

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:51.759
Okay, okay.

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:54.639
What's up with Mom?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.600
It's nothing.

00:10:57.679 --> 00:10:59.320
She's just caring about you.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.240
Why is this room so quiet?

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:10.279
Li Cai

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:12.279
Where's the rabbit we kept at home?

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.440
Looking for the rabbit?

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:15.279
Having soup.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:19.679
This...

00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:20.720
It's ribs.

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:22.039
You mean that rabbit?

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:24.080
I put it in the pet shop.

00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:27.799
At the pet shop?

00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:29.960
No, I...

00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:30.960
Where's my dad?

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:32.240
Dad

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.559
Brother Meng went to Wudang Mountain.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:35.759
Brother Meng

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.759
Went to Wudang Mountain.

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:42.639
That doesn't make sense.

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:43.840
What are you looking for?

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.679
My dad.

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:47.200
Li Li

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.320
I'm a little scared.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.120
What are you thinking?

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:04.279
I'm a bit nervous.

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:05.720
What are you nervous about?

00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:08.480
Your mom, she...

00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:09.320
My mom.

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:11.039
My mom's totally fine.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.159
Don't worry about her.

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:13.480
Let's talk about something important.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.200
What important thing?

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.799
Tomorrow is your birthday.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.360
Don't worry, I've got it all planned.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.039
Really?

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:24.240
This is the first birthday I'll celebrate for you.

00:12:24.559 --> 00:12:25.679
I took half a day off.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.120
I'll make sure you have an unforgettable birthday.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.240
Actually, I've never celebrated my birthday.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.840
You've never had a birthday celebration?

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.559
No.

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:43.360
This is an Earth ID.

00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:46.000
It has your identity info on Earth.

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:47.559
Pick one.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:53.320
I'll take this one.

00:12:58.679 --> 00:12:59.799
Birthday.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.360
June 30, 1995.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.559
Never celebrated since I was little.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.120
Never.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.759
My mom said it's pointless.

00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:10.879
She never let me celebrate.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.000
Li Li

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.840
I promise

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.440
to make up for all your missed birthdays.

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:22.000
I'll make up for every one.

00:13:23.159 --> 00:13:23.799
Okay.

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:24.639
This time,

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:28.200
we'll have the most unforgettable birthday ever.

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.080
Okay.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.519
Sis, you're pretty popular.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.200
Are these all birthday wishes for you?

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.320
Of course.

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:46.960
I've got lots of friends.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.639
Thanks to the Dingguagua Cat Food sisters

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:57.960
Wishing you happiness every day

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.000
May your business thrive

00:14:02.919 --> 00:14:04.279
Thank you, thank you

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:06.519
How did you know it was my birthday?

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.240
Did you see that?

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:12.240
This shows birthdays matter to everyone

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:13.679
Even strangers

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:15.200
will send you their wishes

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:16.799
This is such a warm

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:18.519
and caring planet

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:26.879
I just roughly counted

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.200
A total of 137 floor tiles are loose

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.039
We need to get someone to fix it soon

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:32.320
Okay

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.360
There are so many kids in the yard

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.639
running around and playing

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:36.000
If someone falls or twists an ankle

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.840
that would be a problem

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.120
The parents would be so worried

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.480
You're right, Sister Cai

00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:41.039
I'll have the engineering team

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:42.000
handle it this afternoon

00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:46.039
And what trees are planted in front of Building Seven?

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.080
Building Seven

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.679
Those should be poplars

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.759
I think they look like white poplars

00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:51.960
Go check it out

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.879
Make sure there's no corruption

00:14:55.159 --> 00:14:56.559
That shouldn't be the case

00:14:57.399 --> 00:14:58.639
The owners paid their property fees

00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:00.360
We have to be responsible for everyone

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.639
Yes, yes

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:02.639
I'll verify it right away

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:04.120
By the way

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:04.759
Sister Cai

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.720
We'd like to invite you as our

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.200
Honorary Director of Property Management

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.840
Please think it over carefully

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.159
I have too much going on

00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:12.080
I really can't handle it all

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.039
How about this

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.440
I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow

00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:16.080
Okay

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.000
Then I'll wait for your reply

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.639
Alright, alright

00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:18.559
Okay, that's settled then

00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:20.679
Sister Zhou

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.840
Send me your son's photo

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.480
Xu's daughter from Unit Three is also single

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.240
Both of them work at big companies

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:29.000
They could get to know each other

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.559
Mom, what are you doing?

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.879
Just chatting with the neighbors

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:35.759
Daughter

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.600
Look

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.039
Mom bought you some fish

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.240
Do you want it steamed or braised?

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.000
What do you mean?

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:45.960
It's your birthday

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.360
You have to eat fish

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.919
May you have surplus year after year

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.320
It's my birthday

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.399
It's not New Year's

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:53.120
Just make dumplings then

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.879
I wanted to make you longevity noodles

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:57.080
Dumplings are fine too

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:58.679
Do you want steamed dumplings

00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:00.360
boiled or pan-fried dumplings?

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.200
I, uh

00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:03.399
Let me think about it

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:09.399
Is Aunt Cai's condition getting worse?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.480
The bar owner said

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.440
She'll recover after midnight?

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.360
I think Aunt Cai's illness is kind of nice

00:16:16.679 --> 00:16:18.120
Don't you think she has a kind of

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.120
morbid beauty now?

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.480
I think you're a bit morbid

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.320
Go play with your cat

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:27.000
Look

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.960
Mom got you red-dyed eggs

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:32.000
Mom, that's for postpartum recovery

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:33.919
Thanks for the reminder

00:16:34.559 --> 00:16:35.720
You're almost thirty now

00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:36.679
You should hurry and have another child

00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:37.720
Alright, alright, that's enough

00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:38.360
Okay, Mom

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.039
Stop thinking about it

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:40.440
About my birthday

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:41.759
You don't need to fuss over it

00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:43.080
Meng Hang has already arranged everything

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.440
Your birthday is a big deal for our family

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:47.080
Of course Mom has to be involved

00:16:48.919 --> 00:16:50.600
I've already promised Meng Hang

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.960
We'll celebrate just the two of us

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.039
It's the first time someone is celebrating my birthday

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.279
And this is something I can experience

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.480
One of the most important

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.840
rituals for Earthlings

00:17:00.279 --> 00:17:01.440
It's a rare opportunity

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.720
I don't want any regrets

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:05.839
You should've said so earlier

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.160
I get it now

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.039
Well

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:09.880
What you regret most now is

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.799
your hairstyle

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.480
Let's go

00:17:11.759 --> 00:17:13.000
Mom will take you to get your hair done

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.920
What's wrong with my hair?

00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:17.680
Alright

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:27.200
What's up?

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:27.920
Sis.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.000
My brother-in-law told me

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.279
to tidy up the house a bit.

00:17:30.359 --> 00:17:31.240
He said he wants to surprise you.

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:32.599
Come home a bit later.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.599
Go ahead, do your thing.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.200
As for me,

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:36.640
I can't get back right now.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:37.799
I'm busy.

00:17:38.079 --> 00:17:38.680
That's great.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.200
Charles.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.039
Your dad

00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:46.240
wants you to come home.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.400
Don't be too anxious.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.319
He's just lonely.

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:49.200
Yeah.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.720
He's really lonely.

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:52.720
The urgent thing

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.880
is you should find him a companion.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.960
He'd be so happy.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.200
He'd be happy,

00:17:58.319 --> 00:18:00.160
but what if my mom isn't?

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:02.640
Mom's still here.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.279
So...

00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:04.960
Then

00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:06.279
get him a dog.

00:18:06.599 --> 00:18:08.000
Right? They're so cute.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.200
It could even attract customers to your restaurant.

00:18:11.519 --> 00:18:13.039
What's your restaurant called?

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.119
Piaoxiang Dog Meat Restaurant.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.319
Then buy two houses.

00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:21.240
One in Sanya,

00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:22.880
one in Qiqihar.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.599
Go to Sanya in summer,

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.359
Qiqihar in winter.

00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:27.720
That'll guarantee a long life.

00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:30.160
Mom, you're something else.

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:32.759
How do you manage to step on a landmine
with every sentence?

00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:34.279
Sis.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.839
That's not fair of you to say.

00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:37.279
Even though my Aunt Cai

00:18:37.359 --> 00:18:38.839
comes up with terrible ideas,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.680
her intentions are good.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.279
You're being a bit harsh.

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:43.920
I'm harsh?

00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:45.599
Look at Aunt Cai—

00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:48.160
she's been saying it's your birthday
since early morning.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.640
She went out early to buy fish and groceries.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.279
She even paid for your hair styling.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.519
Spent half the day fussing.

00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:55.599
But you went off with your husband.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.319
Is that fair to her?

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.480
It's not me, it's just—

00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:00.640
As long as my daughter is happy,

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.119
I'm fine with anything.

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:04.079
Aunt Cai.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.960
Parents as thoughtful as you

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.799
are rare these days.

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:08.200
How about this—

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.880
I'll make you my godmother.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.200
That's wonderful!

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.680
Today is truly a great day.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.200
Not only did I

00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:17.319
give birth to Li Li,

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:19.519
I also gained a godson.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.079
You two should celebrate together.

00:19:22.519 --> 00:19:23.240
Li Li.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.480
Call him brother.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.480
Say "brother."

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.599
Just shave my head.

00:19:30.599 --> 00:19:31.759
You two celebrate, I'll become a monk.

00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:38.680
Li Li.

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:39.640
Li Li.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.359
Don't be mad.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.920
I was just chatting with the neighbor.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.200
I never said

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.799
I'd make Charles my godson.

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:49.160
I'm confused too.

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:51.119
Back then,

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:52.799
when you were cold and mean,

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.920
our mother-daughter bond was bad.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.559
Now you're warm-hearted,

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.400
but our relationship still isn't good.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.079
I must've been awful before.

00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:05.079
Did you forget? Back then,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.200
all through my childhood,

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:07.680
you never cared for me.

00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:09.799
Only criticism, never praise.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.519
Sarcasm counted as affection.

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:12.960
Putting me down meant you cared.

00:20:15.559 --> 00:20:17.839
Seems I'm really not a good person.

00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:20.039
It's not all your fault.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.680
Our home planet is just like that.

00:20:22.519 --> 00:20:23.480
You and Dad—

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:25.640
weren't happy together,

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.319
but not sad apart either.

00:20:28.319 --> 00:20:29.480
I don't want that for myself.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.359
Sounds like our family has big issues.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.359
And no one to mediate.

00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:36.960
So,

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:38.640
no matter how advanced a planet is,

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:40.240
it needs a neighborhood committee.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.240
Our planet doesn't have one.

00:20:42.279 --> 00:20:44.640
That's why our planet is way behind Earth.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.039
You really like Earth, huh?

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.599
But you'll have to return to the home planet for work.

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:51.119
What about Meng Hang?

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.319
I've been thinking—

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.599
I'll apply to stay with the editorial department.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.640
If that doesn't work, I'll quit.

00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:01.680
I have a job on Earth anyway.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.400
You've really decided?

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.160
Not going back to the home planet?

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.599
I've made up my mind.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.119
I truly love Meng Hang.

00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:17.000
So I can't leave him.

00:21:18.599 --> 00:21:19.880
Plus, there's his dad,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.279
and all my friends.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.920
I can't bear to leave.

00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:26.119
I don't know what's wrong with me.

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:28.359
Why am I so fragile now?

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:30.680
Maybe

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:32.920
that's Earth's superpower.

00:21:33.599 --> 00:21:34.480
What?

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.359
The thing you just mentioned—

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.599
Love.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.920
Li Li, you look beautiful today.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.119
This hairstyle suits you perfectly.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.119
Really?

00:22:09.839 --> 00:22:11.759
I prepared these photos of us.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.599
Take a look.

00:22:24.319 --> 00:22:24.920
Come on, come on.

00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:29.039
See what I've got ready.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.279
Come.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.480
Sit.

00:22:36.119 --> 00:22:36.799
Thank you.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.519
Thank you.

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:46.079
Sis.

00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:47.079
Happy birthday.

00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:50.079
Thank you.

00:22:51.559 --> 00:22:52.839
Why are you here?

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.240
To join your birthday party.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.200
What party?

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.799
Can't you see this is

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.279
a world for two?

00:23:01.359 --> 00:23:02.720
But I've been busy all day.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.279
You won't even let me eat dinner?

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:05.799
You call that a dinner?

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:06.839
Hurry up and go.

00:23:08.519 --> 00:23:09.720
Brother-in-law, be the judge.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.839
I've been busy all day.

00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:11.759
My sister won't let me eat.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.720
Let me be fair here.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.200
Use my chopsticks.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.640
Have a shrimp first.

00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:24.920
Once you start, you won't stop. Hurry.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.319
I'll eat everything.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:25.880
I'm hungry.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.839
Go, you're not hungry.

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:27.359
Go, go, go. I'm hungry.

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:28.039
Come here.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.839
Let me tell you,

00:23:29.839 --> 00:23:31.839
today is a world for two for me and your brother-in-law.

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:32.880
No one is allowed to interrupt.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.200
Don't worry, sis.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:34.960
I'll just eat.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.759
I won't talk.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.720
I can't starve at my own sister's house, right?

00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:41.079
I'll bring you dinner later.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.599
Stay quiet in this room.

00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:43.480
Don't disturb us.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.319
Okay?

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:44.920
Okay.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.720
Then later,

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.079
keep it down out there, you two.

00:23:47.319 --> 00:23:48.559
Don't disturb my meal, okay?

00:24:02.319 --> 00:24:03.119
Happy birthday.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.039
Braised fish.

00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:10.599
Mom, when did you get back?

00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:12.720
I just came to make you two some dishes.

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:14.119
You two go on, keep going.

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:17.599
Li Li.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.880
Actually, there are a few things

00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:21.720
I've wanted to tell you for a while.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.079
It's just that

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.200
I never found the right time.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.319
I...

00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:29.599
Braised shrimp.

00:24:30.359 --> 00:24:30.960
You two go on.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.640
Go on.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.640
The first time

00:24:40.519 --> 00:24:41.680
I met you,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.119
my impression of you

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.519
wasn't what you think.

00:24:46.759 --> 00:24:47.359
What do you mean?

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.319
But...

00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:50.279
Dumplings.

00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:52.839
Li Li wants some.

00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:53.880
Mom.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.519
Last one, last one.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.359
The first meeting...

00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:04.079
Um...

00:25:04.599 --> 00:25:06.400
Wait till all the dishes are here to talk.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.720
What's this?

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.920
Cake.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.400
There's writing on it.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.680
Wishing

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.839
Li Li a happy birthday.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.720
Mom.

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:29.079
Your name has too many strokes.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.720
My hand shook a bit,

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.400
so it all got smudged together.

00:25:33.319 --> 00:25:34.440
More strokes are good.

00:25:34.519 --> 00:25:35.279
More strokes are good.

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:37.680
Back in school, to get more cream,

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.880
I told the cake seller my name was

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.079
Meng XX.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.720
You made this yourself?

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.799
First time making it.

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:49.279
It just turned out too ugly.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.160
It's not pretty, you guys...

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.799
Just make do and eat it, okay?

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.160
Mom, sit down and eat with us.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.240
No, thanks.

00:25:57.319 --> 00:25:58.920
I'm going to the pet shop.

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:00.359
No, the pet shop is closed.

00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:02.720
Those little animals haven't eaten yet.

00:26:09.079 --> 00:26:10.480
When we first met...

00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:11.480
That day...

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.359
Wait a moment.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.079
Mom.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.599
Mom.

00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:23.160
Don't go yet.

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:23.960
Wait for me.

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:33.319
Meng Hang.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.720
Thank you for preparing

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.960
such a wonderful birthday for me.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.279
I'm really touched.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.880
I promise you,

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.759
from now on, we'll spend every birthday together.

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:46.960
For a lifetime.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.839
I'll be just as thoughtful as you were today.

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:53.759
But tonight,

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.400
I want to spend it with my mom.

00:26:58.319 --> 00:26:59.039
Is that okay?

00:27:05.839 --> 00:27:06.799
As long as you're happy.

00:27:11.599 --> 00:27:12.519
Then I'll go keep Li Cai company.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.559
Keep him in, don't let him out.

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:18.640
Don't worry.

00:27:28.119 --> 00:27:28.599
Mom.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:29.799
Come in.

00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:30.559
What is it?

00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:31.640
It's your birthday.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:32.960
No, no, no.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.200
You celebrate with Xiao Meng.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.319
No Xiao Meng.

00:27:36.319 --> 00:27:37.079
Just the two of us.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.079
Happy birthday to you.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.160
Happy birthday to you.

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:50.759
Happy birthday to you.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.720
Happy birthday to you.

00:27:57.039 --> 00:27:58.759
I hope my daughter

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.799
is as happy every day as she is today.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.720
Then I wish my mom

00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:07.960
can be like today every day.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.000
This child...

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.160
Mom is sick today.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.279
I don't care.

00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:15.720
It's my birthday anyway.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.480
When it's your birthday,

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.319
I'll wish you good health then.

00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:25.839
In those human TV dramas,

00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:27.799
on birthdays,

00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:29.920
they talk about happy memories.

00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:31.519
But the two of us,

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.200
we have nothing.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.240
It's kind of boring.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.240
Oh right, I think

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.519
we're supposed to make a wish.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.200
Need to light candles.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.440
Let me try.

00:28:56.759 --> 00:28:57.960
Hurry, make a wish.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:07.920
I made a wish.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.799
No.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.079
Why?

00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:17.319
Because my wish has already come true.

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:18.680
What wish?

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.359
Right now.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.200
Since I was little,

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.160
I've always wished for this moment.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.119
This kid...

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.720
Mom can't understand you anymore.

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:08.359
Mom.

00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:12.000
Should I blow out the candle?

00:30:13.039 --> 00:30:14.319
I don't know either.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.119
Let me try.

00:30:29.519 --> 00:30:30.079
Forget it.

00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:30.920
It's fine, Mom.

00:30:31.319 --> 00:30:32.200
No, just leave it.

00:30:43.519 --> 00:30:44.400
What are you doing?

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.400
Getting something to eat.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.519
I'm telling you,

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:50.200
you're not going out tonight.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.359
Just stay here.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.160
I'm so hungry my stomach's in knots.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.559
Do you have any fried dough twists?

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.240
No.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.160
Mom, why won't that song stop?

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.200
Yeah.

00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:06.279
Is it going to play forever?

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920
I searched everywhere

00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:34.279
in Dad's room.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.440
Only found this one can.

00:31:37.079 --> 00:31:39.119
When we're out, Brother-in-law will treat you.

00:31:40.079 --> 00:31:40.680
Brother-in-law.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.119
For both dogs and cats.

00:31:43.759 --> 00:31:44.559
Go ahead, eat.

00:31:44.599 --> 00:31:45.799
Aren't you a dog in the zodiac?

00:31:48.079 --> 00:31:48.720
Want to try it?

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.720
I don't like this flavor.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:57.759
It's pretty good.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:13.480
Isn't it?

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.519
Brother-in-law.

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:55.759
Who said you could hold mine?

00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:57.640
You even slept in my bed.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.160
No.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.920
Yesterday you said the sofa was cold.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.079
You let me sleep here, remember?

00:33:06.319 --> 00:33:07.279
How come I don't remember that?

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:10.640
Darn, you're back to normal.

00:33:11.559 --> 00:33:12.200
Yesterday,

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.640
you celebrated my birthday.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.839
I celebrated your birthday?

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.240
You're imagining things.

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:18.680
See?

00:33:18.839 --> 00:33:20.440
I knew you'd never admit it.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.160
I took pictures.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.079
I'll send them to you now.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.319
You even took photos?

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.279
Look.

00:33:28.279 --> 00:33:29.039
Sweet, right?

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.680
So gross.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.000
How do I delete this thing?

00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:34.880
Mom.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.160
You—what "Mom"?

00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:38.839
You're wearing shoes.

00:33:39.359 --> 00:33:41.240
You slept in my bed with your shoes on.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.200
No, you said my feet would get cold.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.480
So you made me keep them on.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.359
Hurry up, I'm telling you—

00:33:47.599 --> 00:33:49.240
All these sheets and covers,

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.160
wash them all, right now.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.119
Don't make me mad.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.159
A birthday party is a special ritual.

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:29.840
I've attended a few before.

00:34:30.519 --> 00:34:31.400
But at this one,

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.159
this birthday-themed party,

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.280
I've never been told

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.719
the main person's age.

00:34:37.079 --> 00:34:39.440
They relive it year after year,

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.360
that eighteenth birthday party.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:45.159
That party must've been a real mess.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.239
Anyway,

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.880
birthdays are the most important day for Earthlings.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:51.559
But there's no holiday for it.

00:34:52.599 --> 00:34:53.199
Yeah.

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:54.559
Even funerals get a day off.

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:56.039
How can birthdays not have one?

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.440
You have to fight for your rights.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:05.960
Sis.

00:35:06.559 --> 00:35:07.480
Let me ask you—

00:35:07.719 --> 00:35:10.000
Our company gives time off for funerals,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.360
but not for birthdays, right?

00:35:12.559 --> 00:35:13.920
So how about this—

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:15.280
On my birthday,

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.199
give me a day off.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.440
When I die,

00:35:17.559 --> 00:35:19.840
I promise I'll show up to work on time.
