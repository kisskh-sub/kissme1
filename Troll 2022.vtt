Ah!

[grunts, gasps]

01:05.083 --> 01:07.458
[man] Hey Tiny, are you coming?

01:07.541 --> 01:09.333
Or you gonna hang there all day?

01:09.416 --> 01:11.458
I'd worry about yourself, you old fossil.

01:11.541 --> 01:12.875

[wind howling]

01:35.125 --> 01:36.833
Do you remember the fairy tale?

01:36.916 --> 01:37.958
Papa.

01:38.041 --> 01:38.958
Come on.

01:39.041 --> 01:41.166
I still don't believe in fairy tales.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.000
That one was your favorite.

01:44.625 --> 01:45.541
Hmm?

01:47.750 --> 01:49.833
Once upon a time, at a big troll wedding,

01:49.916 --> 01:51.875
13 drunk trolls lost track of time,

01:51.958 --> 01:55.083
the sun rose and turned them to stone,
and now they're mountains.

01:55.166 --> 01:56.416
Blah-blah-blah.

01:58.083 --> 01:59.208
You do know that…

02:00.833 --> 02:02.625
there's some truth to every fairy tale.

02:02.708 --> 02:04.041
They're just mountain peaks.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.166
[Papa] You have to see it to believe it.

02:07.666 --> 02:08.958
That's what they say.

02:11.083 --> 02:12.166
It's the opposite.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.708
You have to believe
in something to see it.

02:15.791 --> 02:17.041
[scoffs lightly]

02:17.125 --> 02:18.583
Can you see them, Nora?

02:20.458 --> 02:22.208
Go on, try.

02:22.750 --> 02:23.583
Look.

02:24.375 --> 02:25.625
Not with your eyes.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.166
With your heart.

02:30.375 --> 02:31.500
Believe.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.375
From darkness they came,

03:25.791 --> 03:26.916

03:27.916 --> 03:28.916

we are working around the clock.

03:57.375 --> 03:59.666
The whole team is, uh--
What was that, sir?

03:59.750 --> 04:02.458
I can't hear you,
the reception out here is, uh…

04:03.208 --> 04:04.750
Sir? Hello? Hello?

04:05.250 --> 04:06.500
There's, there's…

04:13.541 --> 04:15.708
Has anyone seen our fearless dino hunter?

04:15.791 --> 04:17.958
She just started a new dig, Secord.

04:18.041 --> 04:19.916
-Another one?
-Mm-hmm.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.166
Over there.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.375
Of course.

04:25.541 --> 04:26.791
[grunting]

04:29.166 --> 04:31.041
You plan to dig up the entire beach, Nora?

04:31.125 --> 04:32.791
[Nora chuckles]

04:35.375 --> 04:36.375
Uh-oh.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.458
I don't like that look.

04:38.541 --> 04:40.708
I just got off the phone
with the university.

04:40.791 --> 04:42.041
[softly] Ah, fuck.

04:42.708 --> 04:43.541
Look.

04:45.083 --> 04:47.625
We've been up and down this coast
for what, six months now?

04:47.708 --> 04:50.458
-Nothing to show for it.
-But we just need a little more time.

04:50.541 --> 04:51.666
Nora. Please.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.500
We're so close. I can feel it.

04:53.583 --> 04:56.916
I'm running out of excuses.
All right? And without financing…

04:57.000 --> 04:58.833
Hell no. Screw the financing.

04:58.916 --> 05:00.166
What are you doing?

05:00.250 --> 05:03.041
If there was one thing
my father ever taught me,

05:03.541 --> 05:05.625
it was to never, ever…

05:06.458 --> 05:09.000

You're shitting me, right?

05:22.791 --> 05:24.916
Get your ass down here, Secord.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.583
We've got something!

05:28.375 --> 05:29.833

05:29.916 --> 05:31.333
[laughing] Yes!

05:33.375 --> 05:35.375
My God! Would you look at that?

05:35.958 --> 05:39.125
From a time of giants.
Just like a… like a fairy tale.

05:40.125 --> 05:41.708
This is no fairy tale.

[sirens whooping]

The only intel we have is from
the recon aircraft, which has produced

these images here.

09:13.666 --> 09:16.666
Oh my God. It looks like
it could be a meteor crater.

09:16.750 --> 09:19.333
The crew is on its way now
to assess the situation.

09:19.416 --> 09:21.000
Has word of this gotten out?

Oh, Is that so? [chuckles]

09:24.416 --> 09:25.583
There's one more thing.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.125
The planes took images of the area nearby.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.041
As of now, we haven't been able to confirm

09:31.125 --> 09:32.833
that the imprints in the landscape

09:32.916 --> 09:34.916
are directly related to the incident.

But, uh, we're working on it.

[chuckles lightly]

09:46.125 --> 09:49.041
I… I guess I shouldn't have said anything.
I'm not qualified.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.250
That's right, yeah.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.166
But we need to find someone who is.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll do it.

10:10.375 --> 10:13.666
Okay. Uh, "impossible", they said.

10:13.750 --> 10:15.166
Absurd.

10:15.250 --> 10:16.583
They even called us mad.

-Oh, you are mad!
-Yes. Just a little bit.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.708
But I think this proves
that if you really have faith

-But this really is top secret.
-Top secret.

11:17.458 --> 11:19.166
-So I've been told.
-[keypad beeps]

11:20.458 --> 11:22.375
You'll get more information very soon.

11:22.458 --> 11:23.708
Yeah, I heard that too.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.750
You could've just called me.

11:26.333 --> 11:28.625

I think you'll understand why.

11:46.791 --> 11:48.458
-That sounded bad, not like that.
-Dude!

11:48.541 --> 11:52.416
You've dragged me out here from a project
I spent years financing and planning.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.750
Yeah? I didn't eat anything
and I'm exhausted,

11:54.833 --> 11:56.541
which is a really awful combination.

11:56.625 --> 11:59.125
-I'm in the dark…
-The reports we received have indicated…

11:59.208 --> 12:01.041
…and I'm not getting one damn answer--

12:11.708 --> 12:12.750
[Nora] Hi.

12:14.083 --> 12:17.416
[Andreas] This is Nora Tidemann.
She's a professor of Paleontology.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.375
Paleontology? Really?

12:19.458 --> 12:20.750
Dinosaurs?

12:20.833 --> 12:22.375
That's right. I study fossils.

12:23.666 --> 12:24.875
-[chair scrapes]
-Hmm.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.333
Dinosaurs have been extinct
for 65 million years, so…

12:28.416 --> 12:31.750
Yes. Well, I guess
we can cross dinosaurs off, then.

12:31.833 --> 12:33.375
Yes. Continue, Lunde.

12:33.458 --> 12:35.125
First of all, I have to be clear

12:35.208 --> 12:38.541
that at this moment
we cannot say with certainty

12:38.625 --> 12:42.791
that this was not a military attack
or act of terrorism.

12:43.291 --> 12:46.666
But the reports so far indicate
that the incident at Dovre

12:46.750 --> 12:48.416
is geological in nature.

12:49.416 --> 12:51.875
In addition to the crater
in the mountainside,

12:51.958 --> 12:54.958
a series of indentations
were discovered in the landscape.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.166
-Could it be a Karst?
-Excuse me?

12:57.708 --> 12:58.541
Sinkholes.

12:59.041 --> 13:02.166
Water seeps through
the mountain's porous crevices,

13:02.250 --> 13:04.875
which dissolves calcium sediments
beneath the ground.

13:04.958 --> 13:08.041
This creates underground caverns,
which ultimately collapse.

13:08.125 --> 13:11.833
But it could also be the accumulation
of large subterranean pockets of gas.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.500
Methane?

13:13.583 --> 13:16.125
Yes, another consequence
of global warming.

13:16.208 --> 13:19.583
[Fred] Yes, well, I guess
we better call Greta. [chuckles]

13:19.666 --> 13:23.166
The demolition work could perhaps
have caused a chain of explosions which--

13:23.250 --> 13:24.250
Sorry.

13:25.000 --> 13:25.833
Sorry.

13:27.583 --> 13:28.750
Are you joking?

13:30.500 --> 13:32.416
-Excuse me?
-Are you joking? Hello?

13:32.500 --> 13:35.416
I can assure you, miss,
that this is deadly serious.

13:36.541 --> 13:38.000
Mm… Okay.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.083
But…

13:40.666 --> 13:42.833
Everyone sees they're footprints, right?

13:45.416 --> 13:46.500
Look at them.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.291
Footprints.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.625
Is there a… specific type of monster

13:51.708 --> 13:53.416
the paleontologist had in mind?

13:53.500 --> 13:54.583
[chuckles]

13:54.666 --> 13:58.291
Well, uh, it makes no sense
considering the deepest footprints…

13:58.375 --> 13:59.541
We have something.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.375
A protester got footage of the incident
with a cell phone camera.

14:04.875 --> 14:07.250
It wasn't easy hacking
the cell phone remotely.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.666
It was nearly impossible,
between you and me.

14:09.750 --> 14:12.000
Then I found a back door.
Had to dig a little.

14:12.541 --> 14:15.166
Um, long story short, bingo!

14:15.250 --> 14:18.958
[chanting on video] Let the mountain live!
Let the mountain live!

14:19.041 --> 14:21.250
Let the mountain live! Let the mountain--

14:21.333 --> 14:24.041
[roaring]

14:25.708 --> 14:27.875
[panting] Oh God.

14:28.375 --> 14:30.750
[rumbling]

14:30.833 --> 14:31.916
[protesters scream]

14:32.000 --> 14:33.708
[woman] Run, go! Get back!

14:35.666 --> 14:38.250
-[screaming]
-[rumbling]

14:43.291 --> 14:45.083
[screaming]

14:45.875 --> 14:46.791
[scream cuts out]

14:52.208 --> 14:53.708
[man clears throat]

14:55.125 --> 14:58.166
-Could that be methane?
-It very well could be, yes. After years…

14:58.250 --> 15:01.375
-The explosion emanates from the same…
-[Nora] Hey. Sigrid?

15:02.083 --> 15:05.458
Can-- Is it possible to, uh,
go back a little… in the film?

15:10.041 --> 15:11.375
Right there, if you can.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.583
-Start from there.
-Let the mountain live--

15:13.666 --> 15:15.416
[roaring]

15:17.666 --> 15:19.708
That sound, it's like some kind of…

15:21.708 --> 15:22.666
animal.

15:23.291 --> 15:25.291
[screaming, rumbling on video]

15:26.875 --> 15:27.708
Stop.

15:27.791 --> 15:30.541
-[audio halts on recording]
-[ominous music rises]

15:51.958 --> 15:53.958
[birds chirping]

15:57.666 --> 15:59.000
[snorts softly]

15:59.083 --> 16:00.500
[barking]

16:00.583 --> 16:02.750
[high-pitched whistling]

16:03.708 --> 16:05.958
[man on radio]
The road past Dovre is temporarily closed

16:06.041 --> 16:08.416
due to construction work
on the new express railway.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.583
The road will be reopened soon,
according to government officials.

16:11.666 --> 16:14.125
-I wonder what's gotten into Solo?
-[woman] Hm.

16:14.208 --> 16:15.833
He's losing his mind out there.

16:15.916 --> 16:17.416
-[barking continues]
-Huh.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.166
Ah, well.

16:19.250 --> 16:22.625
[distant moaning]

16:25.041 --> 16:28.208
[distant moaning continues]

16:29.708 --> 16:31.708
[distant rumbling]

16:36.708 --> 16:38.416
[rumbling intensifies]

16:41.583 --> 16:43.416
-[clattering]
-Huh?

16:44.916 --> 16:47.083
-[barking continues]
-[rumbling]

16:48.958 --> 16:50.416
[whimpers]

16:55.833 --> 16:57.208
-[clattering]
-Dear God!

16:57.875 --> 17:00.291
Honey? Get in the basement!

17:00.375 --> 17:01.583
-[house creaking]
-Hurry.

17:06.375 --> 17:07.708
Oh! Ah!

17:08.291 --> 17:10.416
-[coughing]
-[clattering]

17:11.708 --> 17:15.375
-[rumbling, clattering intensifies]
-[electricity crackling]

17:16.833 --> 17:18.625
[rumbling grows distant]

17:25.708 --> 17:27.416
[door creaking]

17:30.583 --> 17:32.583
[eerie music builds slowly]

17:44.958 --> 17:46.291
[dog barking]

17:48.000 --> 17:50.708
Are you claiming it's a hominid?
Give me a break.

17:50.791 --> 17:53.625
-Morphologically… See those footprints?
-That is enough.

17:53.708 --> 17:56.958
You have to start using language
that everyone can understand!

17:57.041 --> 18:00.458
As far as I can see,
we have two legs, right?

18:00.541 --> 18:01.541
And two arms.

18:01.625 --> 18:04.708
So what you're proposing here
is that it's a giant chimp?

18:04.791 --> 18:06.708
King Kong. Perhaps?

18:06.791 --> 18:10.750
The largest primates on earth
are only… ten to thirteen feet.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.750
According to what we know.

18:12.833 --> 18:16.250
This thing… seems to be
over a hundred and fifty feet tall.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.208
That would be unnatural.

18:18.291 --> 18:19.708
Or supernatural.

18:24.166 --> 18:25.666
And is there nothing

18:26.375 --> 18:27.666
else you've found?

18:28.291 --> 18:30.458
Our searches haven't found
further evidence.

18:30.541 --> 18:32.125
What plans do you have?

18:34.000 --> 18:37.291
Are we gonna sit on our asses discussing
theories, or are we gonna take action?

18:37.375 --> 18:39.291
Miss, please, restrain yourself.

18:40.708 --> 18:41.666
[scoffs lightly]

18:42.541 --> 18:44.500
Professor Tidemann, thank you.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.833
I can put my work on hold
for the time being.

18:49.041 --> 18:51.208
To help out with the efforts in Dovre.

18:52.666 --> 18:56.541
But talking about gas pockets with
Professor Sinkhole is really not for me.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.041
[chuckles]

18:58.125 --> 18:59.583
[rousing music builds]

19:01.375 --> 19:03.375
[overlapping background chatter]

19:07.291 --> 19:08.583
Nora Tidemann.

19:10.125 --> 19:12.583
The Prime Minister has
made you a Scientific Adviser.

19:13.166 --> 19:14.750
There's been an incident in Lesja.

19:14.833 --> 19:16.791
-We need to go there immediately.
-"We"?

19:17.416 --> 19:20.541
Oh. Yes, I've been assigned
to escort you there.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.625
[tense music builds]

19:22.708 --> 19:24.708
[helicopter blades thumping]

19:40.750 --> 19:41.708
[clears throat]

19:42.416 --> 19:44.166
Uh, so what was, uh…

19:44.250 --> 19:46.791
What was the reason
you started digging for fossils?

19:47.666 --> 19:48.791
Uh… [chuckles]

19:49.791 --> 19:53.458
Ever since I was a little girl,
I had a love of nature.

19:54.041 --> 19:57.833
And, of course, I was raised
on stories and fairy tales.

19:57.916 --> 20:00.916
My father was a professor
of origin mythologies and folklore.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.625
Yeah, a folklorist.
I thought they were all extinct.

20:03.708 --> 20:05.291
[Andreas chuckles]

20:05.375 --> 20:07.458
And your mother? What does she do?

20:07.541 --> 20:10.458
-[staticky] She died when I was ten.
-I'm sorry?

20:11.041 --> 20:12.375
She died when I was ten.

20:14.541 --> 20:15.500
Huh.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.583
Well, at least you two had each other.

20:20.083 --> 20:21.750
You and your father, right?

20:25.625 --> 20:26.541
Yeah.

20:26.625 --> 20:27.541
What?

20:29.041 --> 20:33.083
My dad had a huge heart,
and an even bigger imagination, so…

20:34.333 --> 20:37.375
Eventually, he kind of
lost touch with reality.

20:37.458 --> 20:38.458
Really?

20:40.791 --> 20:44.166
"You have to believe in something
to see it," he always said.

20:46.083 --> 20:47.791
Yeah, and then,

20:47.875 --> 20:50.166
his beliefs went a little too far.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.166
-Ah. [chuckles]
-[Nora] Yeah.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.541
I once believed I'd be a writer.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.000
[Nora chuckles]

20:57.083 --> 20:59.208
I'm writing a book right now, actually,

20:59.291 --> 21:01.291
about a monk that can tear his head off

21:01.375 --> 21:03.625
and throw it at the bad guys
so he can bite them.

21:03.708 --> 21:06.333
-That's unreal.
-[Andreas laughs] Right?

21:06.416 --> 21:10.291
Also, he'll pull off his fingers
and throw them like darts, and--

21:13.125 --> 21:15.125
[helicopter blades thumping]

21:30.333 --> 21:31.625
Professor Tidemann?

21:32.458 --> 21:35.291
-Nora.
-Captain Holm, Special Operations Command.

21:35.375 --> 21:38.583
-Andreas Isaksen, Prime Minister's Office.
-Welcome to Lesja.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.333
-[metal clatters]
-Huh.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.041
Here's what we know.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.208
Whatever it was came from that direction.

21:45.708 --> 21:48.500
It made its way across the river
and into the valley.

21:49.250 --> 21:52.125
The tracks continue
two miles south into the mountains,

21:52.208 --> 21:53.458
then come to a stop.

21:53.958 --> 21:55.250
-Come to a stop?
-Yes.

21:56.166 --> 21:57.041
Huh.

21:57.750 --> 22:01.208
-There haven't been any other sightings?
-We did a sweep of the area.

22:01.291 --> 22:02.291
We found nothing.

22:04.458 --> 22:07.375
-You're a paleontologist?
-Her main field is paleobiology.

22:07.458 --> 22:08.833
[Holm] Ah… Right.

22:09.875 --> 22:11.833
So, uh, what's the theory?

22:12.458 --> 22:15.125
That a T-rex has strayed
into the Norwegian mountains?

22:15.208 --> 22:17.875
Well, that remains to be seen,
Captain Holm.

22:17.958 --> 22:18.791
Kris.

22:19.833 --> 22:21.166
You can call me Kris.

22:22.125 --> 22:23.166
Captain Kris?

22:23.250 --> 22:24.541
[sniffs] Yeah.

22:25.291 --> 22:26.166
[chuckling]

22:26.250 --> 22:27.666
[man] Well, I, uh…

22:27.750 --> 22:29.458
I couldn't see it clearly.

22:30.125 --> 22:31.416
It-- It was dark.

22:33.125 --> 22:34.500
[Nora] I see.

22:34.583 --> 22:36.041
Were the clouds outside

22:36.666 --> 22:37.833
blocking the sun?

22:38.666 --> 22:39.625
No, ma'am.

22:39.708 --> 22:41.083
It was something else.

22:41.166 --> 22:42.166
[dog whimpers]

22:42.250 --> 22:45.083
It was as if we were
in the shadow of the mountain.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.541
And the mountain was m-- moving.

22:49.625 --> 22:51.875
Ugh. It scared Solo to death.

22:51.958 --> 22:53.333
Huh, Solo? Huh?

22:53.416 --> 22:54.541
My poor boy.

22:54.625 --> 22:57.166
- Huh? Yes, it did. Didn't it?
-[Nora] And, um…

22:57.250 --> 22:59.958
Are there any other details
you can remember?

23:01.375 --> 23:04.041
Any memory of what happened,
anything at all.

23:04.125 --> 23:06.166
I don't-- I'm so sorry, but I'm…

23:06.250 --> 23:08.291
[sniffs] I'm still in shock.

23:08.375 --> 23:09.291
[Nora] It's okay.

23:11.250 --> 23:13.125
Mmm. Thank you very much.

23:15.291 --> 23:16.625
There was one thing…

23:17.666 --> 23:19.583
-Mm-hm
-[woman] There was this sound.

23:19.666 --> 23:20.541
It…

23:21.125 --> 23:23.708
It sounded like it was… howling?

23:23.791 --> 23:26.958
What are you talking about?
I didn't hear any howling.

23:27.458 --> 23:30.250
Lars can't hear anything.
He has to wear hearing aids.

23:30.333 --> 23:31.208
[Lars] What?

23:31.291 --> 23:32.541
Uh, howling?

23:32.625 --> 23:34.375
Howling like some wind?

23:34.458 --> 23:37.666
No, it sounded more like a… melody.

23:38.791 --> 23:40.125
A sad melody.

23:41.666 --> 23:43.208
[crying] It was heartbreaking.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.958
-[creaking]
-[ominous music plays slowly]

24:02.500 --> 24:05.958
It's almost like a natural disaster
made its way through this valley.

24:06.666 --> 24:08.750
A natural disaster on two legs.

24:09.375 --> 24:11.375
[eerie music builds slowly]

24:20.416 --> 24:21.375
What is that?

24:22.583 --> 24:23.541
What?

24:24.708 --> 24:26.000
That smell?

24:27.375 --> 24:28.500
Norwegian nature.

24:29.458 --> 24:30.291
Yeah.

24:30.916 --> 24:31.958
And something…

24:33.958 --> 24:34.791
more.

24:35.583 --> 24:36.750
More than nature?

24:36.833 --> 24:38.916
Yes. Hypernature.

24:41.458 --> 24:43.000
Hypernature.

24:44.416 --> 24:45.250
Whoa.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.083
Look how deep it is.

24:58.416 --> 25:00.791
-[Andreas] What are you doing?
-[Nora] UV light.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.708
Checking for biological traces.

25:04.833 --> 25:05.833
See anything?

25:07.708 --> 25:08.875
[Nora] Nothing.

25:08.958 --> 25:10.541
Only earth and stones.

25:12.625 --> 25:13.500
[chuckles softly]

25:14.375 --> 25:15.875
[chuckles] What?

25:15.958 --> 25:16.958
Forget about it.

25:18.333 --> 25:19.875
It's just some old rhyme.

25:21.958 --> 25:23.166
Is there a plan?

25:25.250 --> 25:26.625
What are you thinking?

25:32.500 --> 25:34.875
Did you say it was
two miles south of here?

25:34.958 --> 25:36.958
[energetic music playing]

25:43.958 --> 25:45.333
[Holm] It stops down there.

25:46.958 --> 25:48.083
No more tracks.

25:50.250 --> 25:51.666
Look at the thermal scanner.

25:52.583 --> 25:53.791
There's no sign of life.

25:54.333 --> 25:55.958
Nothing's there, just mountains.

25:58.375 --> 26:01.083
Impossible. It's too big
to just disappear into thin air.

26:01.166 --> 26:02.541
And no place to hide.

26:15.208 --> 26:16.916
CAMOUFLAGE?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.416
[Holm] Do you have a theory?

26:23.333 --> 26:24.625
[sighs deeply]

26:26.166 --> 26:27.916
-Damn it!
-What is it?

26:29.083 --> 26:29.916
Ugh.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.916
There's someone we need to… visit.

26:40.083 --> 26:42.000
Listen, if it's okay with you,

26:42.083 --> 26:44.375
um, it's better if I do all the talking--

26:44.458 --> 26:45.666
I'm staying here!

26:47.083 --> 26:48.333
I won't go back there.

26:49.791 --> 26:51.500
We aren't taking you anywhere.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Lower the shotgun, Papa, please!

26:58.166 --> 26:59.250
Tiny?

26:59.333 --> 27:01.333
[somber music plays]

27:04.750 --> 27:06.500
Can you lower the shotgun?

27:14.416 --> 27:15.833
It's been a while.

27:16.416 --> 27:17.416
[sighs]

27:18.958 --> 27:20.791
Yes, I've been kind of busy.

27:22.250 --> 27:23.083
Huh…

27:25.750 --> 27:27.333
What's up with the egghead?

27:28.791 --> 27:30.166
Andreas Isaksen.

27:30.250 --> 27:32.416
Advisor to Prime Minister Moberg.

27:32.500 --> 27:33.333
Ha!

27:33.416 --> 27:34.791
[chuckles] Yeah.

27:34.875 --> 27:36.333
-Everything okay?
-Hey!

27:36.416 --> 27:37.541
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:37.625 --> 27:39.083
-Easy!
-Hey, hey!

27:39.166 --> 27:40.583
Put it down.

27:41.333 --> 27:42.625
This is Captain Kris…

27:43.375 --> 27:44.666
toffer Holm.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.500
And Kris, this is Tobias Tidemann.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.083
It's-- It's… It's her father.

27:50.208 --> 27:51.041
Okay.

27:54.375 --> 27:55.250
It's a pleasure.

27:56.125 --> 27:57.750
Can we go inside and talk?

27:58.708 --> 28:00.166
Come on. This is important.

28:05.333 --> 28:06.333
Maybe…

28:07.083 --> 28:10.000
Get some pants to put on as well.

28:11.208 --> 28:13.333
[chickens clucking]

28:28.916 --> 28:30.875
I see you hired a decorator.

28:31.375 --> 28:33.541
Uh… No.

28:41.708 --> 28:43.791
The winter of 1943,

28:44.750 --> 28:46.791
the Nazis used Russian war prisoners

28:46.875 --> 28:49.875
to build the Nordland Railway,
but only got to Bodø.

28:49.958 --> 28:52.375
Some believe the construction stopped

28:53.208 --> 28:55.416
due to something they found
inside the mountain.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.083
Oh yeah? What was it?

28:57.166 --> 28:58.833
[Nora] Something came out of the mountain.

28:58.916 --> 29:02.583
Exactly. But it would've been hard
to prove, so they got rid of the witnesses

29:02.666 --> 29:03.708
and suppressed all of it.

29:03.791 --> 29:05.666
No, Papa. Today.

29:07.708 --> 29:09.500
Something came out of the mountain today.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.500
-[rumbling]
-[screaming]

29:16.333 --> 29:17.916
[screaming continues]

29:18.791 --> 29:20.791
[roaring]

29:28.750 --> 29:30.416
We have followed

29:30.500 --> 29:32.750
footprints of this, uh, thing.

29:32.833 --> 29:35.041
But they just stop, all of a sudden.

29:35.125 --> 29:37.916
[Tobias] Huh, huh, huh,
huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.458
And no superstition, fairy tales,
or fantasy, or any of that.

29:41.541 --> 29:43.833
We've put all that to rest, right, Papa?

29:44.666 --> 29:47.625
I just thought there may be
something in your work

29:47.708 --> 29:49.458
to point us in the right direction.

29:51.041 --> 29:53.416
You know these mountains
better than anyone.

29:55.416 --> 29:57.291
Ah…

30:01.500 --> 30:04.583
Did you know Norway
imposed the maximum penalty

30:04.666 --> 30:07.458
for contact with trolls up until 1840?

30:07.541 --> 30:08.458
Trolls?

30:09.416 --> 30:11.541
Why were we never taught
that trolls actually existed?

30:11.625 --> 30:12.458
[Nora] Tobias!

30:12.541 --> 30:15.125
They wandered freely
a thousand years ago. It's the truth.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.375
Didn't I just tell you
not to bring that up again?

30:17.458 --> 30:21.500
You know a thousand years is just
a blip in the evolutionary process.

30:22.250 --> 30:23.958
If the trolls really lived here,

30:24.041 --> 30:26.041
scientist would've found DNA profiles

30:26.125 --> 30:29.833
or troll fossils in sedimentary rocks,
and their extinction could be explained.

30:29.916 --> 30:33.166
We already know the explanation
for why they died off.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.583
The Christianization of Norway.

30:38.250 --> 30:40.750
Oh, and why does no one else
know about this except you?

30:40.833 --> 30:43.541
That's because I was
this close to revealing it all.

30:43.625 --> 30:46.875
They threw me in the loony bin.
They have always known.

30:47.833 --> 30:49.000
For the love of God…

30:49.583 --> 30:51.541
Kittelsen, what was he hiding?

30:53.583 --> 30:55.791
This obvious mistake. Was it on purpose?

30:55.875 --> 30:57.416
-[Andreas] Mistake?
-Please.

30:57.500 --> 31:01.791
The collection of folk tales,
all the myths, all the artwork he did.

31:01.875 --> 31:04.125
-It was to cover up the truth.
-Papa!

31:04.208 --> 31:07.625
Every recorded fairy tale was written
to tarnish the trolls' reputation.

31:07.708 --> 31:10.750
To make fun of them.
Asbjørnsen and Moe's contribution.

31:10.833 --> 31:13.125
-[Nora sighs]
-They portrayed them as dumb!

31:13.208 --> 31:16.791
Evil and stingy. Meanwhile,
the humans were so great!

31:16.875 --> 31:18.916
We're enlightened and mentally superior.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.166
Yeah. If you tell a lie enough times,
people will take it as the truth.

31:22.250 --> 31:24.416
-Ah! The egghead admits it.
-Huh?

31:25.166 --> 31:26.166
Of course!

31:28.333 --> 31:31.000
[Nora] Wait. I think we should take
a couple minutes to breathe…

31:31.083 --> 31:33.416
-That sounds like a good plan.
-A couple minutes?

31:33.500 --> 31:35.833
We can't waste a second.
Let's get going, Tiny.

31:35.916 --> 31:37.208
Don't call me that.

31:37.291 --> 31:38.458
An adventure!

31:38.541 --> 31:39.458
Watch your head.

31:39.541 --> 31:42.083
[tense music building]

31:43.083 --> 31:44.916
[Andreas] They stop abruptly.

31:46.958 --> 31:49.208
We're right here, is that right?

31:50.500 --> 31:51.500
That's the spot.

31:51.583 --> 31:52.541
Yeah?

31:55.041 --> 31:56.625
That means he walked

31:56.708 --> 31:59.250
from there all the way here.

31:59.333 --> 32:00.166
"He"?

32:01.208 --> 32:04.083
I suppose it could be a gyger.

32:04.166 --> 32:05.416
A… gyger?

32:07.166 --> 32:08.416
An ogress.

32:10.083 --> 32:11.958
A female troll.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.250
[sighs] Ay…

32:18.500 --> 32:20.000
Take the chopper down! Here!

32:21.833 --> 32:22.791
Take it down!

32:23.583 --> 32:24.708
Go down now!

32:31.833 --> 32:33.250
Old man Tidemann.

32:34.458 --> 32:35.708
An interesting guy.

32:37.583 --> 32:38.416
[Nora scoffs]

32:39.625 --> 32:42.208
He’s always been a tad… eccentric.

32:43.291 --> 32:47.333
And then, he went so far down
the rabbit hole he lost his job over it.

32:48.583 --> 32:50.208
It's pretty sad, actually.

32:50.291 --> 32:52.625
He was committed
to a hospital for a while.

32:53.375 --> 32:54.208
I see.

32:55.166 --> 32:57.958
I… I hoped I would find him
in a better state.

33:03.666 --> 33:05.833
Hey, I should probably help.

33:06.416 --> 33:08.250
-Okay.
-I think that's a good idea.

33:12.583 --> 33:13.666
You find anything?

33:15.000 --> 33:17.083
It's wrong. Everything is wrong here.

33:17.166 --> 33:18.000
What is?

33:18.083 --> 33:19.083
[Tobias] Everything.

33:20.083 --> 33:22.041
Topography. It doesn't match.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.291
Everything is off.

33:24.125 --> 33:24.958
See?

33:29.916 --> 33:30.750
Eh…

33:31.500 --> 33:32.625
What?

33:33.875 --> 33:35.416
It's been a while.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.833
You and I adventuring,
just like old times.

33:37.916 --> 33:40.083
This isn't a reconciliation between us.

33:40.583 --> 33:41.833
Please don't, okay.

33:43.166 --> 33:45.291
I still remember the sparkle in your eye

33:45.375 --> 33:47.708
when I told you about
the secrets of the world.

33:48.208 --> 33:50.500
The same curiosity as your mother.

33:52.416 --> 33:53.291
What happened?

33:54.416 --> 33:55.916
I grew up, all right?

33:56.000 --> 33:57.125
Oh, come on.

33:58.416 --> 34:02.083
What do you think
we're looking for here, Nora? Hmm?

34:02.166 --> 34:04.416
What you're suggesting
is nothing but a fantasy.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.750
The dinosaurs were also once
considered fantasy creatures.

34:07.833 --> 34:10.500
-Unnatural.
-No, they are nature.

34:10.583 --> 34:13.250
-For God's sake.
-Made of earth and stones.

34:14.500 --> 34:17.541
From within the mountain,
it rose from the ground…

34:17.625 --> 34:19.333
-Hm?
-[Nora sniffing]

34:19.416 --> 34:21.083
-What is it?
-That smell.

34:21.958 --> 34:22.833
[sniffs]

34:23.541 --> 34:25.041
Look, I bathe every Saturday.

34:25.125 --> 34:26.291
Not you, it's…

34:28.041 --> 34:29.333
hypernature.

34:30.875 --> 34:32.000
Hypernature?

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Hypernature…

Come on!

Yes. Putting it on the screen now.

36:37.333 --> 36:39.041
-Pretty intense, huh?
-Yeah.

36:39.125 --> 36:41.500
-Even the square is scared.
-Yes, it's big.

36:42.041 --> 36:43.583
-Papa?
-Yeah?

36:43.666 --> 36:44.958
No matter what they ask…

36:45.500 --> 36:47.500
Whatever the people in uniforms say,

36:47.583 --> 36:49.750
swear you won't say the word "troll".

36:49.833 --> 36:50.791
Okay?

36:50.875 --> 36:52.958
Troll? What do you mean, troll?

36:53.041 --> 36:56.375
-Does the sound not work or--?
-He doesn't mean a fairy tale creature.

36:56.458 --> 36:57.750
-It's more like a…
-A troll!

36:57.833 --> 36:59.625
This is a troll!

37:00.125 --> 37:01.208
I'm sorry.

37:01.708 --> 37:05.583
The point is that we really don't know
what kind of creature we're dealing with

37:05.666 --> 37:07.125
unless we have more time to--

37:07.208 --> 37:10.541
Time? We don't have one second to waste.

37:10.625 --> 37:13.250
Yes, but we can't make
rash decisions either.

37:13.333 --> 37:16.166
What are you suggesting?
Inviting the troll to a friendly race?

37:16.250 --> 37:18.458
-[scoffs]
-Just like in the fairy tales?

37:18.541 --> 37:20.416
Here's my two cents. All due respect.

37:20.500 --> 37:23.166
I don't think you're mentally stable
if you fail to see

37:23.250 --> 37:25.958
that tunneling through
the Dovre Mountains…

37:26.041 --> 37:27.500
-Papa.
-…is a mockery of nature.

37:28.083 --> 37:29.750
-But that's what you guys do!
-Tobias.

37:29.833 --> 37:32.958
Just move ahead.
Never stopping to ask if you should!

37:33.041 --> 37:34.541
-What are you doing?
-I'm helping.

37:34.625 --> 37:36.875
No, you're not!
This is just like our PTA meetings--

37:36.958 --> 37:38.125
Are you finished?

37:38.208 --> 37:40.833
-That crazy teacher of yours--
-If I may interrupt.

37:40.916 --> 37:44.625
This isn't a small ogre we're talking
about, but a fully grown mountain troll.

37:44.708 --> 37:47.583
-Get that man out of here.
-20 years I've been doing troll research.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.583
And I'm the crazy one?! I'm the crazy one?

37:50.666 --> 37:52.750
-I'll take care of it.
-Yeah, good luck!

37:52.833 --> 37:54.083
-Excuse me.
-[Nora] Hey.

37:54.166 --> 37:55.000
[Tobias] Enough!

37:55.500 --> 37:56.416
I'll go!

37:56.500 --> 37:58.708
-Let go of me! Let go of me!
-Prime Minister.

37:58.791 --> 38:01.708
The answer may come
if you please give us more time. Okay?

38:01.791 --> 38:04.750
I'm sorry, Tidemann. The risk is too high.

38:04.833 --> 38:07.041
We're implementing a military operation.

38:10.625 --> 38:11.541
[scoffs]

38:12.041 --> 38:14.500
You insist on your fairy tale theories,

38:14.583 --> 38:17.708
but this isn't some
mystical fantasy creature

38:17.791 --> 38:21.041
that can smell Christian blood
and turns to stone in sunlight.

38:21.125 --> 38:23.708
If you're so sure about it,
why'd you come to me?

38:28.583 --> 38:31.958
This is the end of our little adventure.
I'm going back to the dig.

38:33.125 --> 38:34.708
It was nice to see you, Papa.

38:34.791 --> 38:37.291
Imagine waking up,
and everything you know is gone.

38:38.458 --> 38:40.541
You wake up to a whole new world.

38:42.833 --> 38:43.958
Like this troll…

38:46.958 --> 38:48.125
This creature…

38:50.208 --> 38:52.083
You think it wants to be here?

38:54.291 --> 38:55.958
We can scare it with weapons.

38:56.041 --> 38:57.708
We can push it around.

38:57.791 --> 38:59.125
But I promise, Nora.

38:59.208 --> 39:00.750
Nature will push back.

39:04.583 --> 39:06.916
What do you want to do? Just give up?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.083
Even egghead doesn't want to give up.

39:10.125 --> 39:11.416
No…

39:16.750 --> 39:18.541
The adventure has just begun.

39:21.625 --> 39:23.625
[dramatic music builds slowly]

39:29.500 --> 39:30.583
There you are.

39:30.666 --> 39:32.375
[energetic music plays]

39:32.458 --> 39:33.333
[Nora] Kris!

39:34.166 --> 39:35.166
Captain!

39:35.958 --> 39:38.708
You're civilians, Tidemann.
This is a military operation.

39:39.500 --> 39:42.291
Oh, so now we're on
a last-name basis, Captain Holm?

39:42.791 --> 39:44.333
We won't be in the way.

39:44.416 --> 39:45.625
We will only observe.

39:46.208 --> 39:48.708
-You won't even know we're there.
-[clanging]

39:48.791 --> 39:50.666
-[man] Hey!
-Sorry. Sorry!

39:50.750 --> 39:52.375
It's completely out of the question.

39:53.583 --> 39:56.541
But we have to bend the rules
a little sometimes, don't we?

39:59.041 --> 40:01.416
Kris. Please.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.083
Tidemann.

40:05.166 --> 40:06.416
-Yes?
-Yeah?

40:06.500 --> 40:10.458
If you do come along,
you have to lay low and follow my orders.

40:10.541 --> 40:11.833
Understand?

40:14.041 --> 40:15.916
And if Oslo finds out I brought you along…

40:16.000 --> 40:16.916
Yeah, I…

40:17.458 --> 40:19.833
Don't worry.
You'll be dead before sunrise.

40:24.541 --> 40:26.541
[energetic music playing]

40:40.791 --> 40:41.666
Go! Go! Go! Go!

40:41.750 --> 40:42.708
Now!

40:46.500 --> 40:47.708
[chainsaws buzzing]

41:06.083 --> 41:07.708
[high-pitched whirring]

41:10.583 --> 41:11.916
[Sigrid] Ladies and gentlemen,

41:12.000 --> 41:13.958
we are live from Heidal.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.333
[Holm] Piranha, this is Viking.

41:18.416 --> 41:20.000
Status? Over.

41:20.083 --> 41:22.750
Viking, this is Piranha.
We are in position. Over.

41:23.333 --> 41:25.375
[Holm] 3-Alpha, status? Over.

41:27.083 --> 41:28.333
Viking, this is 3-Alpha.

41:28.416 --> 41:29.916
We are in position. Over.

41:30.416 --> 41:31.500
Copy that.

41:36.416 --> 41:37.291
What now?

41:38.916 --> 41:40.125
We wait.

41:40.791 --> 41:42.791
[yawns, sighs]

41:42.875 --> 41:46.583
[Tobias] So do I have this right?
He can take off his own head…

41:46.666 --> 41:47.750
[Andreas] Yeah.

41:47.833 --> 41:50.250
[Tobias] He can throw it at people
and bite them?

41:50.333 --> 41:52.041
[Andreas] Exactly, or his hand.

41:52.125 --> 41:53.958
He can rip it off and throw it,

41:54.041 --> 41:55.500
like a fist-snowball.

41:55.583 --> 41:56.458
[chuckles]

41:57.125 --> 41:58.958
Huh. Fascinating.

41:59.041 --> 42:00.458
Yeah, it, uh…

42:04.250 --> 42:05.291
[exhales]

42:06.333 --> 42:08.791
[distant animal calls]

42:19.750 --> 42:21.250
Can you picture it?

42:23.416 --> 42:25.708
Wandering around in large herds.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.125
Families.

42:30.125 --> 42:31.916
"Made of earth and stones."

42:32.000 --> 42:34.333
"A snow-clad heart, and ice for bones."

42:38.333 --> 42:39.250
[Tobias chuckles]

42:40.625 --> 42:41.916
I remember it all.

42:45.125 --> 42:47.000
The fairy tales from you and Mom,

42:48.208 --> 42:51.458
and all the… emptiness after.

42:54.791 --> 42:56.375
How we dealt with it.

42:58.250 --> 43:00.083
I remember that as well.

43:02.708 --> 43:04.583
The adventures of Big and Tiny.

43:08.541 --> 43:11.291
[chuckles] Is this a reconciliation thing?

43:12.500 --> 43:13.625
You and me?

43:13.708 --> 43:14.708
[chuckles lightly]

43:17.666 --> 43:19.666
[exhales deeply]

43:24.541 --> 43:26.708
Is that a PVS-31?

43:27.500 --> 43:29.291
Uh, it is, actually.

43:30.291 --> 43:31.750
That's what I thought.

43:31.833 --> 43:34.041
-Do you have military experience?
-A little.

43:34.583 --> 43:35.416
Oh yeah?

43:36.166 --> 43:37.291
"Call of Duty."

43:39.250 --> 43:40.666
[chuckling]

43:40.750 --> 43:41.750
[chuckles]

43:41.833 --> 43:43.458
Nora, the truth is, um…

43:45.458 --> 43:47.291
you lost us both,

43:47.375 --> 43:48.833
when your mother died.

43:54.875 --> 43:55.875
You're here now.

43:59.041 --> 44:00.333
You old fossil.

44:02.500 --> 44:03.416
Mm.

44:04.625 --> 44:05.875
Are you crying?

44:05.958 --> 44:06.916
[chuckles softly]

44:07.958 --> 44:09.625
It's my pine allergy. [sniffs]

44:10.125 --> 44:11.041
[chuckles]

44:11.125 --> 44:13.083
-I'm allergic to forests.
-[chuckling]

44:19.708 --> 44:21.333
[kisses, sniffs]

44:24.291 --> 44:26.375
-Ah…
-[Holm] Pretty sweet, huh?

44:26.458 --> 44:28.958
These things give you
a real arcade feeling, am I right?

44:29.041 --> 44:31.125
-Yeah.
-[man on radio] 3-Alpha for Viking.

44:31.208 --> 44:33.541
-3-Alpha for Viking, over.
-Viking, go ahead.

44:33.625 --> 44:35.791
[distant moaning]

44:35.875 --> 44:37.500
Copy that. I need my helmet.

44:37.583 --> 44:39.750
Here… Loosen the strap.

44:39.833 --> 44:40.666
-Ow!
-Hold still.

44:40.750 --> 44:43.375
-Get your fat fingers out of there.
-Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

44:43.458 --> 44:44.291
[Holm] Man…

44:45.166 --> 44:46.208
[distant rumbling]

44:46.291 --> 44:47.208
He's here.

44:50.791 --> 44:52.916
[ominous music playing]

44:53.000 --> 44:54.833
[monitors beeping]

45:00.083 --> 45:01.375

[rumbling continues]

[sniffs deeply, exhales]

45:12.708 --> 45:14.708
[sniffs, grumbles]

45:15.291 --> 45:16.708
It's stopping.

45:16.791 --> 45:18.666
Ah, he knows we're here.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.916
Oslo, this is Viking. Awaiting orders.

45:25.541 --> 45:26.708
[Lunde] Viking,

45:27.625 --> 45:29.666
you are authorized to open fire.

45:32.500 --> 45:34.000
3-Alpha, this is Viking.

45:35.083 --> 45:36.166
Engage the target.

45:37.125 --> 45:38.041
Copy that.

45:38.125 --> 45:39.041
Open fire.

45:39.125 --> 45:40.208
You idiots!

45:52.791 --> 45:54.250
[Holm] What the hell…

45:54.958 --> 45:55.833
It's not working.

45:55.916 --> 45:57.333
You're pissing him off.

45:57.416 --> 45:58.625
[Holm] 3-Alpha, fall back!

52:43.458 --> 52:44.458
[Andrea] No, no, no.

52:44.541 --> 52:48.291
He's a zen master using his spirituality
to manipulate the physical realm.

It came to a stop in a valley.

And?

53:09.875 --> 53:11.458
They're preparing an air strike now.

What? How come?

53:14.625 --> 53:15.625
Nora…

53:17.208 --> 53:18.958
We don't have a lot of options.

53:20.000 --> 53:20.958
I mean, uh…

53:22.375 --> 53:23.875
What are we even facing?

53:25.708 --> 53:27.458
I can't explain what I saw.

53:28.250 --> 53:30.375
I don't know what to believe anymore.

53:32.375 --> 53:33.250
Let's assume.

53:34.541 --> 53:35.708
Let's assume what?

53:36.875 --> 53:38.250
Let's assume

53:38.916 --> 53:41.083
there's truth to the fairy tales.

53:41.166 --> 53:42.333
[sighs] Nora,

53:42.416 --> 53:45.208
you've been through a lot
in the last 24 hours.

53:45.291 --> 53:47.333
-I think it's best--
-Hey, I found it!

53:47.416 --> 53:48.250
Huh?

53:48.875 --> 53:49.916
Your father.

53:51.375 --> 53:54.666
He said that Kittelsen
made a mistake… in the drawing.

53:55.458 --> 53:57.458
See? Trolls can't survive the sun.

53:57.541 --> 54:01.083
But look. The troll is roaming
the streets in broad daylight.

54:01.166 --> 54:03.416
No, then Kittelsen was right.

54:04.000 --> 54:04.958
What do you mean?

54:06.208 --> 54:07.958
We've seen it during the day.

54:08.458 --> 54:09.291
But,

54:09.375 --> 54:11.750
what other rules
are there from the fairy tales?

54:11.833 --> 54:12.791
Are you serious?

54:12.875 --> 54:14.583
-Okay.
-It's-- It's just so…

54:14.666 --> 54:15.833
So sunlight aside…

54:15.916 --> 54:17.041
Remember. We…

54:17.125 --> 54:18.750
We grew up with these, Andreas.

54:18.833 --> 54:21.166
-Come on.
-Uh, don't feed them after midnight?

54:21.250 --> 54:22.875
Tell me you guys are joking right now.

54:22.958 --> 54:24.041
Crosses-- Crosses?

54:24.125 --> 54:26.833
-[Holm] Isn't that vampires?
-Crosses? Not crosses…

54:26.916 --> 54:27.875
The Christians.

54:30.125 --> 54:31.041
The soldier.

54:32.458 --> 54:35.666
Look. "It smells
like Christian blood in here."

54:36.166 --> 54:38.458
-The Christianization of Norway.
-Okay.

54:39.791 --> 54:41.125
MOISTURE - BOULDERS

54:43.250 --> 54:44.750
[tense music builds]

54:46.833 --> 54:49.375
The plan you're suggesting
is completely insane.

54:49.458 --> 54:51.458
Foolish and insane!

54:51.541 --> 54:53.625
We can't be advised by far-fetched…

54:53.708 --> 54:54.833
Superstition?

54:54.916 --> 54:55.916
Fiction?

54:56.000 --> 54:57.208
[Fred] Come on!

54:57.291 --> 54:58.291
Seriously?

54:59.083 --> 55:00.458
[Nora] Old myths

55:00.541 --> 55:04.166
make reference to trolls
throwing boulders at churches.

55:04.250 --> 55:06.375
Because they hated the sound of the bells.

55:06.458 --> 55:09.041
[laughing] This keeps
getting better and better!

55:09.125 --> 55:10.583
-[laughter continues]
-[sighs]

55:10.666 --> 55:12.708
Where do you stand on this, Andreas?

55:14.291 --> 55:15.541
Uh, Prime Minister.

55:16.125 --> 55:19.791
Um, up until this point, based
on the information we can gather…

55:19.875 --> 55:21.625
-We can't seem to find…
-General?

55:23.708 --> 55:25.583
Permission to speak freely, sir?

55:26.250 --> 55:27.750
Go ahead, Captain.

55:27.833 --> 55:31.708
This enemy we're facing…
it's something we've never seen before.

55:32.541 --> 55:34.083
The modern weapons we tried

55:34.833 --> 55:36.000
had no effect.

55:37.041 --> 55:38.916
I believe that
Professor Tidemann is right.

55:41.375 --> 55:43.250
We have to think outside the box now.

55:44.375 --> 55:45.625
Prime Minister.

55:45.708 --> 55:48.250
Tidemann's proposal is radical.

55:48.333 --> 55:52.250
That's for sure. And if there's one thing
that Captain Holm and I both know,

55:52.333 --> 55:55.041
it's that extreme circumstances call for

55:55.875 --> 55:57.250
extreme measures.

55:57.833 --> 55:58.833
[Moberg] Very well.

55:59.333 --> 56:01.708
-Carry out the operation.
-Are you kidding me?

56:04.916 --> 56:06.916
[monitors chiming]

56:10.000 --> 56:12.791
[Fred] If we evacuate now,
it will be total chaos.

56:12.875 --> 56:14.541
-People will panic.
-But we need a plan.

56:14.625 --> 56:16.833
-But we just can't--
-[Lunde] It's up.

56:16.916 --> 56:18.875
And it's moving southeast.

56:20.625 --> 56:22.208
What's in its path?

56:23.000 --> 56:26.083
HUNDERFOSSEN FAMILY PARK
LILLEHAMMER

56:26.166 --> 56:29.083
-[folksy music playing]
-[patrons chattering]

56:36.583 --> 56:37.791
[laughter]

56:37.875 --> 56:40.750
-Thank you!
-Don't run too far, okay.

56:56.375 --> 56:57.541
[distant rumbling]

57:02.708 --> 57:04.916
-[rumbling]
-Viktor?

57:05.000 --> 57:06.166
[chattering]

57:06.250 --> 57:07.833
-[rumbling]
-Earthquake.

57:10.625 --> 57:13.083
[patrons screaming]

57:13.166 --> 57:16.375
[rumbling approaches]

57:17.916 --> 57:19.708
[ominous music rises]

57:19.791 --> 57:21.333
[snorts]

57:22.750 --> 57:24.833
[patrons clamoring]

57:31.833 --> 57:33.250
[screaming]

57:37.125 --> 57:38.833
[panicked shouting]

57:43.375 --> 57:45.875
[distant bells tolling]

57:45.958 --> 57:48.041
[helicopter blades thumping]

57:50.583 --> 57:52.875
Tidemann, what will the bells do?

57:52.958 --> 57:54.291
Will it explode?

58:01.125 --> 58:02.500
Oh great.

58:02.583 --> 58:05.541
[bells tolling]

58:05.625 --> 58:06.833
[Holm] This is Hocus 1.

58:06.916 --> 58:08.916
Hold formation, let's make the first pass.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.750
-[growling]
-[bells clanging]

58:15.666 --> 58:17.166
[snarls]

58:18.500 --> 58:21.583
-[bells clanging]
-[groaning]

58:21.666 --> 58:22.875
It's working!

58:22.958 --> 58:24.291
[screaming continues]

58:24.375 --> 58:27.541
[groaning]

58:27.625 --> 58:28.916
[troll bellows]

58:29.000 --> 58:31.500
This is Hocus 1. We have to move closer.

58:31.583 --> 58:34.125
-[bells clanging]
-[troll moaning]

58:34.208 --> 58:36.291
-[screaming]
-Viktor!

58:36.375 --> 58:38.125
[rousing music builds]

58:38.208 --> 58:40.208
[groans, roars]

58:42.875 --> 58:45.041
[growling]

58:45.625 --> 58:47.208
Hocus 3. Incoming, left side!

58:47.291 --> 58:49.000
[growls]

58:50.875 --> 58:52.333
Mayday, mayday! We're going down!

58:52.416 --> 58:54.250
[bell clanging]

58:56.666 --> 58:59.416
[roaring]

58:59.500 --> 59:01.041
[energetic music playing]

59:03.291 --> 59:05.625
Hocus 4, climb, climb, climb!

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
[snarls]

59:14.083 --> 59:16.250
[roars]

59:21.958 --> 59:23.333
[Nora] No.

59:23.416 --> 59:24.375
[bell clangs]

59:38.458 --> 59:40.625
You saw that, right?
Did he mean to do that?

59:41.916 --> 59:43.833
[growling]

59:44.500 --> 59:46.875
[snarls, grunts]

59:53.500 --> 59:56.333
[reporter] We have shocking images
coming out of Norway at this hour.

59:56.416 --> 1:00:00.250
We are on the ground here in Norway,
and it's a nation in panic.

1:00:00.333 --> 1:00:04.375
People running for their lives
from what seems to be a giant creature.

1:00:04.458 --> 1:00:06.416
[in Japanese]
Could it be a Norwegian Godzilla?

1:00:06.500 --> 1:00:09.125
[in English] They don't know what
kind of creature they're dealing with.

1:00:09.208 --> 1:00:11.416
It just… really scared me.

1:00:12.416 --> 1:00:14.541
More than a dozen buildings were crushed.

1:00:14.625 --> 1:00:16.500
The military is everywhere!

1:00:16.583 --> 1:00:18.250
We're talking about a monster here!

1:00:18.333 --> 1:00:20.833
-[in French] Devastation.
-[in Brazilian Portuguese] Destruction…

1:00:20.916 --> 1:00:21.916
[in English] Total chaos.

1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.250
Imagine the consequences if this creature
reaches more populated areas.

1:00:26.333 --> 1:00:30.291
If we follow these tracks, it appears
to be heading straight for the capital.

1:00:30.875 --> 1:00:35.000
[woman on TV] In Norway, the military
is struggling to find a way to stop

1:00:35.083 --> 1:00:37.875
what appears to be a monster.

1:00:37.958 --> 1:00:39.958
[somber music playing]

1:01:00.333 --> 1:01:05.208
We know it wasn't the desired outcome,
but… we are onto something here.

1:01:05.708 --> 1:01:07.500
Because we saw the bells had an effect.

1:01:07.583 --> 1:01:08.750
We have to face the facts.

1:01:08.833 --> 1:01:10.208
-Sooner or later.
-Yes.

1:01:10.291 --> 1:01:12.916
We have a killing machine
making its way towards the capitol.

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.708
Yes, time is of the essence.

1:01:14.791 --> 1:01:18.791
Which is why it's important to find out
what we're up against here.

1:01:18.875 --> 1:01:21.041
We have to find out why it's coming here.

1:01:21.125 --> 1:01:22.708
Figuring that out gives us a chance to--

1:01:22.791 --> 1:01:24.375
So what is it, then?

1:01:27.166 --> 1:01:28.916
If you open up your mind to it…

1:01:30.916 --> 1:01:32.083
What do you think?

1:01:32.166 --> 1:01:33.291
A threat!

1:01:34.583 --> 1:01:35.958
-That's all I need to know.
-[sighs]

1:01:36.041 --> 1:01:38.125
This is a threat
that must be stopped by force.

1:01:38.208 --> 1:01:39.916
-And not hocus-pocus.
-Prime Minister.

1:01:43.541 --> 1:01:46.041
The incredible isn't impossible.

1:01:48.083 --> 1:01:49.250
[inhales deeply]

1:01:50.875 --> 1:01:52.750
Thank you kindly for your contribution,

1:01:53.250 --> 1:01:54.375
Professor Tidemann.

1:01:57.166 --> 1:01:58.000
[Nora scoffs]

1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:02.541
Tidemann.

1:02:12.916 --> 1:02:14.041
Uh, hi.

1:02:26.625 --> 1:02:27.583
[Holm] Nora?

1:02:31.791 --> 1:02:33.416
No one could've done any better.

1:02:33.500 --> 1:02:34.500
[scoffs]

1:02:36.541 --> 1:02:37.958
They're making a mistake.

1:02:38.041 --> 1:02:39.166
That's what I think.

1:02:40.750 --> 1:02:41.833
Captain Kris.

1:02:41.916 --> 1:02:42.875
[chuckles softly]

1:02:44.750 --> 1:02:46.083
Just let me know,

1:02:46.166 --> 1:02:47.916
if there's anything else I can do.

1:02:50.166 --> 1:02:52.166
As long as church bells aren't involved.

1:02:52.250 --> 1:02:53.125
[chuckles]

1:02:53.208 --> 1:02:54.375
I'll do my best.

1:02:55.416 --> 1:02:58.291
We'll barricade all roads
from the northeast.

1:02:58.791 --> 1:03:00.541
And if it breaks through them?

1:03:00.625 --> 1:03:02.458
Well, there is… another alternative.

1:03:02.541 --> 1:03:03.708
No.

1:03:03.791 --> 1:03:05.916
No? What are you talking about?

1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:09.208
We, uh, have at our disposal,

1:03:10.166 --> 1:03:11.166
missiles

1:03:12.333 --> 1:03:14.500
that have yet to be approved… officially.

1:03:14.583 --> 1:03:16.000
What you are suggesting

1:03:16.083 --> 1:03:19.833
goes against everything
the Norwegian Armed Forces stand for.

1:03:19.916 --> 1:03:21.750
Not to mention the catastrophic damage--

1:03:21.833 --> 1:03:23.958
What kind of weapons are we talking about?

1:03:24.041 --> 1:03:25.916
Why wasn't I informed of this before?

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:29.000
-It was still in development.
-We shouldn't even be considering this.

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:31.416
[Fred] Prime Minister.

1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:33.375
Um, should he be here?

1:03:33.458 --> 1:03:34.791
[chuckles dryly]

1:03:34.875 --> 1:03:35.833
[inhales] Really?

1:03:35.916 --> 1:03:39.000
Why don't you leave us alone
for a moment, Andreas?

1:03:40.916 --> 1:03:42.125
[Andreas scoffs lightly]

1:03:53.375 --> 1:03:55.500
You can consider this my resignation.

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.000
[exhales]

1:04:10.958 --> 1:04:11.958
Excuse me.

1:04:13.083 --> 1:04:15.083
[keypad beeping]

1:04:15.625 --> 1:04:16.541
[chimes, buzzes]

1:04:16.625 --> 1:04:17.666
[distant chattering]

1:04:17.750 --> 1:04:18.666
Nora!

1:04:20.333 --> 1:04:21.583
I'll take it from here.

1:04:21.666 --> 1:04:22.625
What are you doing?

1:04:23.166 --> 1:04:24.416
You, uh…

1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:25.541
You forgot this.

1:04:26.500 --> 1:04:28.583
Come on. Come on. I-- I'll… I'll drive.

1:04:30.291 --> 1:04:32.916
-[distant alarms blaring]
-[scattered chatter]

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:34.458
What's going on?

1:04:34.541 --> 1:04:36.041
They're evacuating Oslo.

1:04:37.291 --> 1:04:39.291
[tense music builds slowly]

1:04:46.333 --> 1:04:47.208
[beeps]

1:04:49.875 --> 1:04:51.166
Fellow citizens.

1:04:53.875 --> 1:04:57.000
Many of you have already heard
the news from the Dovre area.

1:04:57.583 --> 1:05:00.916
And the media coverage showing
what happened at Gudbransdalen.

1:05:02.291 --> 1:05:04.000
And you could have thought that

1:05:04.500 --> 1:05:05.958
these were special effects.

1:05:07.041 --> 1:05:09.208
However, this is not make believe.

1:05:09.291 --> 1:05:11.208
This is all real.

1:05:11.708 --> 1:05:15.083
Norway has been prepared
to deal with major crises.

1:05:16.708 --> 1:05:20.875
But nothing could have prepared us all
for the crisis we are currently facing.

1:05:23.083 --> 1:05:27.500
A creature unknown to science has
risen from deep within Dovre Mountain.

1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.625
So now our history must be re-written.

1:05:34.250 --> 1:05:36.166
But we need to ensure the safety

1:05:36.250 --> 1:05:39.250
of our citizens and country… right now.

1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:43.958
Since the first reports came in
from Dovre Mountain yesterday,

1:05:44.041 --> 1:05:47.375
the government, the armed forces,
and our top scientists

1:05:47.458 --> 1:05:50.416
have done their best
to get control of the situation.

1:05:53.708 --> 1:05:56.208
It is with a heavy heart that I tell you

1:05:56.708 --> 1:05:59.750
that our efforts so far,
unfortunately, have failed.

1:06:01.791 --> 1:06:05.041
We have deemed it necessary
to explore all options

1:06:05.125 --> 1:06:07.791
to prevent the loss of human lives.

1:06:10.875 --> 1:06:14.416
I urge you all
to take this situation as seriously

1:06:14.500 --> 1:06:16.916
as the administration and parliament does.

1:06:19.458 --> 1:06:22.250
I hereby declare a state of emergency.

1:06:22.333 --> 1:06:26.666
And the immediate evacuation
of Oslo and all neighboring areas.

1:06:28.458 --> 1:06:31.000
We have faced crises
in the past, and endured.

1:06:31.916 --> 1:06:33.083
We stood united.

1:06:33.166 --> 1:06:34.916
We took care of each other.

1:06:36.708 --> 1:06:39.708
With every fiber of my being, I beg you.

1:06:41.375 --> 1:06:42.666
Look out for one another.

1:06:43.916 --> 1:06:45.708
And God bless us all.

1:06:48.250 --> 1:06:49.333
And our fatherland.

1:06:49.416 --> 1:06:50.500

1:06:50.583 --> 1:06:52.333
[horns honking]

1:06:54.250 --> 1:06:55.916
Resignation.

1:06:56.791 --> 1:06:59.333
I said resignation. [groans]

1:06:59.416 --> 1:07:01.333
That's something my grandpa would say.

1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:06.375
Why couldn't I have said "I quit"
like normal people do?

1:07:07.625 --> 1:07:09.125
I'm such a bonehead.

1:07:13.625 --> 1:07:14.708
-Sinding?
-[Nora] Mm…

1:07:15.708 --> 1:07:18.750
I don't get what it means.
He's written it more than once.

1:07:18.833 --> 1:07:21.375
Sinding, and something about a Gatekeeper.

1:07:21.458 --> 1:07:22.833
It could be Rikard Sinding.

1:07:24.250 --> 1:07:25.083
Who's that?

1:07:25.666 --> 1:07:27.375
The Palace Lord Chamberlain.

1:07:29.541 --> 1:07:30.958
I, uh, kind of know him.

1:07:31.458 --> 1:07:33.666
We met a few times at the Royal Palace.

1:07:42.791 --> 1:07:44.500
The king… [inhales sharply]

1:07:45.833 --> 1:07:47.166
-What is it?
-Turn around.

1:07:47.791 --> 1:07:49.875
-Turn around?
-Home's the Royal Palace.

1:07:52.333 --> 1:07:53.375
Okay…

1:07:53.458 --> 1:07:54.625
[tires squealing]

1:07:54.708 --> 1:07:55.583
Sorry, sorry.

1:07:55.666 --> 1:07:57.750
Sorry! Prime Minister's Office!

-We come in peace.
-Hands in the air!

1:08:18.916 --> 1:08:21.833
-Turn around, walk back to the car!
-We're from the Prime Minister's Office.

1:08:21.916 --> 1:08:23.833
-Get back, all right!
-We don't have time for this!

1:08:23.916 --> 1:08:26.166
-[weapon clicking]
-This is your last warning!

1:08:26.250 --> 1:08:27.458
Fine. We can wait, I guess.

1:08:27.541 --> 1:08:29.500
Walk back slowly, towards the car!

1:08:29.583 --> 1:08:31.041
[man] Stand down, gentlemen.

1:08:32.458 --> 1:08:33.500
Stand down.

1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:36.125
[chuckling] Sinding!

1:08:36.208 --> 1:08:38.083
Remember me? Isaksen.

1:08:39.291 --> 1:08:41.083
Prime Minister Moberg's advisor.

1:08:42.083 --> 1:08:44.583
I assumed that someone
would show up eventually.

1:08:45.333 --> 1:08:47.375
I can't say I'm surprised

1:08:47.458 --> 1:08:49.291
that it was a child of Tidemann's.

1:08:54.458 --> 1:08:56.791
[cane tapping]

1:08:56.875 --> 1:08:58.875
You have your father's eyes.

1:08:59.666 --> 1:09:01.791
I had a lot of respect for your father.

1:09:02.708 --> 1:09:05.083
Although I know Tobias despised me,

1:09:06.041 --> 1:09:07.541
he really was a good man.

1:09:08.291 --> 1:09:09.875
And stubborn as a mule.

1:09:13.916 --> 1:09:17.875
I can count on one hand
the number of living people who have seen

1:09:17.958 --> 1:09:19.958
what you are about to see.

1:09:21.791 --> 1:09:23.791
[metal doors clanking]

1:09:29.291 --> 1:09:31.916
I would normally insist

1:09:32.958 --> 1:09:34.875
on ladies going first.

1:09:37.708 --> 1:09:38.791
I won't tell anyone.

1:09:39.750 --> 1:09:42.875
[Sinding] There was a time when
it was believed to be good luck

1:09:42.958 --> 1:09:47.083
to build the Royal Palace
on top of another king's home.

1:09:49.083 --> 1:09:53.291
It was nearly discovered in the 1920s
during construction for the subway.

1:09:54.458 --> 1:09:55.750
And once again.

1:09:55.833 --> 1:09:57.458
Twelve years ago.

1:09:58.250 --> 1:09:59.500
Twelve years ago?

1:09:59.583 --> 1:10:01.916
I deeply regretted what we did to Tobias.

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.208
But it had to be done. I'm sorry.

1:10:04.291 --> 1:10:08.458
You destroyed the life of an innocent man,
and all you give is some bullshit apology?

1:10:09.041 --> 1:10:11.458
I hope this will provide you some answers.

1:10:14.041 --> 1:10:16.083
-[power clanking]
-[electricity buzzing]

1:10:17.125 --> 1:10:20.291
This was the home of the Troll King.

1:10:24.583 --> 1:10:25.666
Oh God!

1:10:26.916 --> 1:10:29.000
[Sinding]
During the Christianization of Norway,

1:10:29.083 --> 1:10:32.666
Olav the Holy rid the land of anything
incompatible with the new faith.

1:10:35.166 --> 1:10:37.750
He knew, that even for trolls,

1:10:37.833 --> 1:10:40.083
nothing could be more important

1:10:41.083 --> 1:10:42.666
than family.

1:10:44.250 --> 1:10:45.250
What happened?

1:10:46.916 --> 1:10:47.916
An ambush.

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.333
It was a massacre.

1:10:50.958 --> 1:10:54.250
But, they spared one
of the Mountain King's children.

1:10:54.833 --> 1:10:58.500
And used it to lure him to Dovre,
deep into the mountain.

1:11:00.041 --> 1:11:02.333
Where they locked him up inside a cavern.

1:11:03.500 --> 1:11:04.791
Where they left him

1:11:04.875 --> 1:11:06.208
for dead.

1:11:14.500 --> 1:11:16.041
Then my father was right.

1:11:16.875 --> 1:11:19.708
The king is making his way
back to his castle.

1:11:20.375 --> 1:11:21.791
He's going home.

1:11:27.250 --> 1:11:29.041

1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:36.500
Andreas.

1:11:37.333 --> 1:11:38.166
See that?

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:44.541
From darkness they came.

1:11:44.625 --> 1:11:46.541
And died in the light.

1:11:47.875 --> 1:11:50.875
That can't be right. We…
We've seen him in broad daylight.

1:11:50.958 --> 1:11:52.416
We've seen him during the day.

1:11:53.291 --> 1:11:55.291
But have we seen him in direct sunlight?

1:11:55.375 --> 1:11:57.958
How does that help us?
We can't control the sun.

1:12:00.291 --> 1:12:02.625
What is the biggest vehicle you have?

1:13:19.750 --> 1:13:21.583
Prime Minister, it's your decision.

1:13:25.041 --> 1:13:26.125
You have my approval.

Let's kill this thing before it kills us.

1:13:34.083 --> 1:13:37.750
Downtown is too populated, but if
we lure him away from the city center…

1:13:37.833 --> 1:13:39.166
Maybe Holmenkollen?

1:13:39.250 --> 1:13:40.333
That's too far away.

1:13:41.125 --> 1:13:43.541
We need something closer,
and with an easier route.

1:18:12.416 --> 1:18:13.750
Huh? System malfunction.

1:18:13.833 --> 1:18:15.750
System malfunction. It's not working.

1:18:15.833 --> 1:18:16.791
Yahtzee.

1:18:19.083 --> 1:18:21.000
[jet engine whooshing away]

1:18:22.625 --> 1:18:23.541

1:18:23.625 --> 1:18:24.541
Siggi.

1:18:24.625 --> 1:18:25.625
[exhales]

1:18:26.500 --> 1:18:27.500
Okay!

1:18:27.583 --> 1:18:29.458
-What's going on?
-Uh, I don't know.

1:18:29.541 --> 1:18:31.041
Why isn't anything happening?

1:18:31.125 --> 1:18:33.666
For some reason, I can't establish
contact with the control panel.

1:18:33.750 --> 1:18:35.916
Solve it! Just keep going.
Get connected, for God's sake.

1:18:44.958 --> 1:18:45.791
Hm?

1:18:48.625 --> 1:18:50.500
What if I'm just like my father?

1:18:51.333 --> 1:18:52.666
Completely nuts.

1:18:52.750 --> 1:18:56.375
In a world gone mad,
then only the crazy can be sane.

1:18:57.625 --> 1:19:00.958
And you're the craziest person
on this planet, Nora Tidemann.

1:19:03.833 --> 1:19:05.333
Thank you. [inhales]

1:19:11.791 --> 1:19:12.708
Okay, Andreas.

1:19:32.875 --> 1:19:33.875

-[tires squeal]
-Ah!

1:20:51.166 --> 1:20:52.291
[Holm] We need more time.

1:20:52.875 --> 1:20:55.000
We don't have it! We'll be there in 15.

1:20:55.083 --> 1:20:56.125
[Andreas] Oh shit!

1:20:56.208 --> 1:20:57.833
[explosions]

1:20:58.916 --> 1:21:00.208
Make it ten.

No, Nora…

1:21:01.833 --> 1:21:03.416
[slow, dramatic music playing]

1:21:04.625 --> 1:21:05.458
We're not ready…

1:21:05.541 --> 1:21:07.791
[overlapping background chatter]

1:21:13.250 --> 1:21:14.458
Attention!

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:17.208
Let's bring it in!

1:21:17.833 --> 1:21:18.708
Come on!

1:21:23.125 --> 1:21:25.875
We have an incoming threat
from that direction.

1:21:25.958 --> 1:21:28.208
Estimated arrival is ten minutes out.

1:21:30.333 --> 1:21:32.708
What's about to come
over that hill right now

1:21:32.791 --> 1:21:35.208
is unlike anything
you've been up against before.

1:21:36.333 --> 1:21:37.791
And I'll be honest with you.

1:21:39.666 --> 1:21:42.583
There's a very good chance
this operation won't go our way.

1:21:43.708 --> 1:21:45.666
But we have to ask ourselves…

1:21:47.208 --> 1:21:48.250
Who are we?

1:21:48.791 --> 1:21:50.875
If we lay down without a fight?

1:21:51.708 --> 1:21:54.750
Who are we if we let fear control us?

1:21:54.833 --> 1:21:56.208
Who could be proud

1:21:56.291 --> 1:22:00.041
if we let some damn creature
waltz right over us without saying,

1:22:00.125 --> 1:22:03.166
"It ends here!
We'll put you back in the ground!"?

1:22:03.250 --> 1:22:04.958
[all cheer] Yeah!

1:22:18.375 --> 1:22:20.333
Wait! The skull!

1:22:20.416 --> 1:22:22.000
We-we-we… We lost the skull!

Party time.

1:23:47.541 --> 1:23:49.250
He has nobody.

1:23:52.208 --> 1:23:54.291
The last one of his kind.

1:23:55.375 --> 1:23:56.583
[roars fiercely]

1:23:56.666 --> 1:23:59.458

a bigger billy goat is nearby,

1:24:03.708 --> 1:24:06.208
I suggest that
you step on the gas especially fast!

1:24:57.500 --> 1:25:00.208
[tech] No, something is blocking
the system from the inside.

1:25:05.333 --> 1:25:06.791
[Fred] What are you doing?

1:25:07.375 --> 1:25:09.833
Uh… I'm glad you showed up.

1:25:09.916 --> 1:25:12.583
Um, I think someone hijacked my laptop.

1:25:12.666 --> 1:25:15.625
I opened this weird email, it was…

1:25:15.708 --> 1:25:17.666
from this prince in Nigeria--

1:25:22.458 --> 1:25:23.916
Do you realize

what you've done?

1:31:41.125 --> 1:31:42.666
[heartbeat stops]

1:31:42.750 --> 1:31:44.750
[stone crackling]

1:32:00.166 --> 1:32:01.166
[Holm exhales]

1:32:05.125 --> 1:32:06.458
[exhales forcefully]

1:32:12.791 --> 1:32:15.125
No more Norway Cup here, that's for sure.

1:32:15.208 --> 1:32:16.375
[exhales sharply]

1:32:20.166 --> 1:32:21.541
Oh.

1:32:21.625 --> 1:32:23.250
[chuckles lightly]

1:32:24.791 --> 1:32:26.291
-Brother.
-Brother.

1:32:30.958 --> 1:32:31.875
[chuckles softly]

1:32:36.125 --> 1:32:37.333
[exhales deeply]

1:32:40.083 --> 1:32:41.208
What do we call it?

1:32:43.125 --> 1:32:44.583
"Dovre Boulder"?

1:32:44.666 --> 1:32:46.666
[both chuckle]

1:32:49.791 --> 1:32:51.666
[Andreas] "Tidemann Hill"? [chuckles]

1:32:53.458 --> 1:32:55.208
Maybe "Troll Rock"?

1:32:58.875 --> 1:33:00.458
"Tobias Boulder".

1:33:01.416 --> 1:33:03.083
-[chuckles]
-That's nice.

1:33:27.208 --> 1:33:29.541
[distant sirens wailing]

1:33:37.875 --> 1:33:39.291
You look good with a black eye.

1:33:39.375 --> 1:33:40.375
Huh?

1:33:43.250 --> 1:33:44.375
Professor Tidemann.

1:33:47.125 --> 1:33:48.666
I don't know what to say.

1:33:49.250 --> 1:33:50.166
[scoffs softly]

1:33:50.750 --> 1:33:52.166
[Andreas chuckles quietly]

1:33:59.541 --> 1:34:02.708
Prime Minister, before I go,
I want to be clear, when I resigned,

1:34:02.791 --> 1:34:06.375
I didn't mean with work altogether,
but just that I'm quitting this job.

1:34:09.833 --> 1:34:12.041
[groans] Berit, I'm gonna be a writer!

1:34:15.833 --> 1:34:16.833
[Lunde] Mm-hm.

1:34:22.666 --> 1:34:24.458
Do you think there are more out there?

1:34:24.958 --> 1:34:27.333
In a cave deep beneath some mountain?

1:34:29.041 --> 1:34:32.041
[mysterious music builds slowly]

1:34:35.541 --> 1:34:37.541
[intense music playing]

1:34:57.166 --> 1:34:59.166
[music fades out]

1:34:59.250 --> 1:35:01.250
[wind gusting]

1:35:12.875 --> 1:35:14.875
[tense music builds slowly]

1:35:17.791 --> 1:35:19.791

-[stones clattering]

1:35:21.916 --> 1:35:23.916

1:35:26.125 --> 1:35:29.166

1:35:29.250 --> 1:35:31.250
[rousing music plays]

1:36:28.666 --> 1:36:30.875
[rousing music fades out]

1:36:30.958 --> 1:36:32.750
[somber music playing]

1:37:22.750 --> 1:37:24.750
[energetic music rises and falls]

1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000
[epic music builds slowly]

1:39:25.666 --> 1:39:27.666
[music fades]

1:39:31.875 --> 1:39:33.875
[pleasant music plays softly]

1:40:44.875 --> 1:40:46.875

[music fades out]
