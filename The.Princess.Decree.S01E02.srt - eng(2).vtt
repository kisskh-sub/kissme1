to do it, I'll do it for you.

did he not plead to His Majesty,

but he even wrote a recommendation
for a marriage alliance instead.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.759

who breaks his word easily.

I'm going to ask him myself.

he is this year's imperial scholar.

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:23.920
His Majesty appointed him
to be your teacher yesterday.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.439
He will teach you how to write.

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:29.959

However, I've still
gained something out of this.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.090
I need to stay in
the Princess Royal Residence for now

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.480

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:21.519

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.519

We'll plan for it

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:42.320
when I get the booklet

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.830

at Princess Royal's Residence.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.600

you've been watching the show

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.200
behind the curtain for a whole day.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:20.080

(Gan Sheng, General of Jing

before doing that in public

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:32.639
to humiliate all the literary officials.

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:34.600
It is really interesting.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.279
However,

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.360
I still have something
that I don't understand.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.279
If Your Highness

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:42.559
hates Li Yuanze so much,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.159
why not kill him

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.759

Your Highness,

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.320
why do you say that?

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:01.840
A game

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.440
is only interesting
when it takes time to play.

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:07.440
Letting him die so easily

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.559
would be letting him off easily.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.159
Is Your Highness not afraid

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:13.600

I have nothing to be afraid of.

this litchi from Lingnan.

What?

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.279
Are you going to make me peel it myself?

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.600
This is what I should do

00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:46.759
