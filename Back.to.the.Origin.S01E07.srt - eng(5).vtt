00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.720
This back of yours

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.720
just won't quit.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.039
You'd better be careful,

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.759
you're not 20 anymore!

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.840
It's just age catching up.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.840
Quit talking like that.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.160
Your subordinates'

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.920
gonna think

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.520
they can walk all over you.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.000
Right there in the lower back,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.920
yeah, that's it!

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.880
Better now?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.080
Stop being a couch potato.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.480
Get some exercise.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.760
All done?

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.079
Ain't enough for you?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.520
Hey, I've noticed

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.040
something off about Xinying.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.240
What's up?

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.600
She keeps

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.640
cutting my calls

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.840
short.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.480
I think she might

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.360
have a boyfriend?

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.920
She's at that age,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.920
dating, marriage,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.440
it's all par for the course.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.520
You don't get it. It's wild out overseas.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.960
I'm fine if she's

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.640
dating for marriage,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.040
but what if she's fooling around...

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.680
Whoa, whoa,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.360
cut her some slack, will you?

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.800
I just need to keep her in line.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.840
Xinying,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.880
Mom's been thinking...

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.360
Why'd you quit?

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.440
Talking to her makes me

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.560
nervous now.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.520
You know,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.000
one wrong move

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.280
and she'll flip out.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.040
You lucked out

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.960
missing

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.079
her teen years abroad, nightmare!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.840
How do I even start the conversation?

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.560
Don't start it.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.680
So carefree...

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.760
The patch's kicking in!

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.920
Li Nian's showing good progress

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.760
in his cognition, movement,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.600
and hormone levels

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.720
these past

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.560
three months.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.200
But he's still behind

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.960
other kids at his age

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.320
intellectually.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.920
About your husband's

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.079
question on

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:58.840
kindergarten,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.160
looking at his progress,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.200
you might wanna give it a shot.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.480
Think I'll hold off.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.000
He came early

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.560
and needs more time.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.800
Maybe when he's bigger.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.840
Makes sense.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.200
You've been through the wringer

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.280
since day one.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.280
It's tough.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.079
You can

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.399
check the report on your phone.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.680
Let me know

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.360
if anything's not clear.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.920
My eyes are acting up,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.200
maybe from

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.840
all the screen time.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.120
Thought I might need glasses.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.200
Give these a shot.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.440
Wow, what a difference!

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.720
Not nearsighted,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.880
you're getting old eyes.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.080
Nearsightedness

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.240
is for the kids.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.280
Our age?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.200
It's reading glasses and glaucoma territory.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.159
My eyes are aging?

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.120
How old are you?

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.480
45.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.960
Totally normal.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.080
Most women your age

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.520
are hitting menopause.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.120
How's your monthly cycle?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.800
266,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.360
274,

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.080
275,

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.320
269,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.920
270...

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.040
Mom,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.840
what are they doing?

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.480
Drive carefully, Daoqi.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.280
Take it easy.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.280
I'll...I'll stay put.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.600
OK, get some rest.

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:58.960
Spray away!

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.400
Had a few drinks and

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.760
scared she'll catch you?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.320
No,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.760
my checkup showed

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.760
a fatty liver,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.920
so Cheng Man's gone into

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.320
full health-police mode.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.080
Yeah, right.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.360
You're wrapped around her finger.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.280
Not wrapped,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.640
just showing respect for women.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.840
That's your excellent parenting

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.840
showing through, Mom.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.280
-Such a sweet talker. -Gotta go!

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.040
Wait up!

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.680
What now?

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.480
Here.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.640
Why dump the leftovers on me?

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.800
Not leftovers!

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.920
I cooked

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.640
your favorites

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.880
specially for you.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.840
Braised pork!

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.720
Put it in the fridge.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.240
What gives?

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.120
No can do!

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.159
If she catches me

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:33.520
with braised pork, I'll be braised.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.440
Put it in the fridge.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.400
I'll sneak back for it later.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.000
Peace out!

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.280
Halt!

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.200
Trying to crush me?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.040
Sure, she's right

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.880
about your health,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.640
but we

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.400
need to talk.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.440
When's Nian

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.520
getting into kindergarten?

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.200
Can't keep him home forever!

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:52.000
Huh? Sorry, wasn't listening.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.040
What was that?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.480
You little punk!

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.480
Forget it, Mom. I got this!

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.920
Later!

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.760
Playing stupid again.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.600
There goes my cooking.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.880
All set?

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.560
Yep, go for it.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.480
OK,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.000
keep an eye on the shot.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.040
Hey everyone!

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.440
Zhang Ran here,

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.000
your city explorer.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.080
Check out

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.760
this beauty behind me,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.800
the Lucheng Bridge,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.760
our city's crown jewel.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.320
It's way more than just

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.560
steel and concrete,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.400
it's packed with

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:35.800
memories

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.240
for all of us locals.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.600
Back in the day,

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.880
I'd zip across

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.480
on my bike.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.080
Now here I am

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.760
getting older by the minute.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.840
But this beauty?

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.480
Still looking as fresh as ever,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.200
spanning this river.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.880
So, if...

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.120
you all...

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.240
Let's take it from the top.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.760
One, two, three,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:05.960
action!

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.400
Hey everyone!

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.120
I'm your city explorer,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.680
Zhang Ran.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.440
Check out this bridge

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.120
behind me,

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.160
the Lucheng Bridge,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.400
it's our whole...

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.040
I swear I'm gonna kick you!

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.080
This bridge behind me,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.040
the Lucheng Bridge,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.520
is the pride of

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.800
our city...

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:55.840
Dad...

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:00.800
Dad!

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.320
What are you doing up?

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.040
Bathroom run.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.840
What's cooking?

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:15.880
Gimme, gimme that.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.720
Hot, hot!

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.320
Let me...

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.640
Go...

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.280
Man, so good!

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.680
Had liver surgery,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.280
not doing great.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.320
Last checkup was rough.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.720
My wife's banned me from meat.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.960
This stays between us,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.120
OK?

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.720
Dad,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.880
gotta watch your health.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.480
C'mon,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.360
what's life worth

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.360
if everything's

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.280
off-limits?

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.720
Where's the fun in that?

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.880
We've got good genes,

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.120
My grandpa made it to 98,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.400
was actually

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.080
bored of living!

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.320
His secret

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.200
of longevity?

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.920
Did what he wanted,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.520
ate what he wanted.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.080
Hold back and

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.000
that's when you get sick.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.720
Am I right or am I right?

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.880
Yeah, kinda...

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.600
They say

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.400
your cravings tell you

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.240
what your body needs.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.120
Now you're talking!

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.840
Kid,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.400
you're stuck like me,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.680
wives running our lives

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.880
with all these rules.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.920
Poor thing...

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.640
I'm OK...hey, stop!

00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.880
Last two pieces.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.280
Lemme get a nice fatty piece.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.160
Dying for some fat.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.000
Just one! One piece!

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.240
Keep that wrap intact,

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.360
gotta cover it up again.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.800
I'll restore it precisely.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.440
Yeah.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.640
Zhang Ran isn't that controlling.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.600
Not controlling?

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.320
Her presence is enough, right?

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.680
Wanna know

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.600
what she was crazy about as a kid?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.240
Tigers.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.960
You two

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.480
are indeed

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.040
a perfect match!

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.440
I mean,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.640
all the other little girls

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.600
were into dolls,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.000
toy cars,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.560
flowers, whatever.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.080
She was fixated on tigers.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.680
Big tigers, baby tigers.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.480
Even got a tiger head

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.760
on her pencil box!

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.960
Tigers are awesome,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.840
strong and fierce.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.400
Yep, she's

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.040
her mom's daughter in that respect!

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.240
Having a bossy lady

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.640
ain't so bad.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.280
Think about everything she's been through,

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.120
you know some of the stuff.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.440
If she'd been

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.400
some pushover,

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.480
imagine how she'd have gotten burned.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.840
We'd never

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.440
stop worrying!

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.640
Yummy!

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.800
Look, kid,

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.160
here's what I've learned

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
at my age,

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.880
A wife who keeps you in check is a gift!

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.720
If a guy

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.680
wants real freedom,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.640
he's gotta let someone else

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.880
handle the tough stuff,

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.760
let her do the worrying.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.960
That's my guide to life

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.640
right there!

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.240
That's the gospel truth!

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.360
Here, try the lean piece.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.280
I'm stuffed, really.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.160
Down the hatch then.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:06.760
Help yourself.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.560
What kind of fix is this?

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.920
Water's going everywhere!

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.720
I stuck some waterproof tape

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.680
on it...

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.520
Tape? Really?

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:19.760
Since when does

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.720
anyone fix pipes with only tape?

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.920
Well, so what

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.880
if it's leaking now?

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.680
Maybe it'll stop on its own!

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.440
And Zhang Ran, asked for

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.640
her help this morning,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.440
but she bolted without even looking.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.920
And you, with this mess.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.560
Both of you,

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.800
completely useless!

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:40.560
Dad...

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.120
Mom...

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.480
Mom, next time

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.080
this happens,

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.200
don't use the sink right away.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.240
Let the pipes

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.360
drain first,

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.280
otherwise

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.440
the leak will

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.600
wreck the cabinets.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.600
Also, use some

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.320
mild acidic drain cleaner

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.000
now and then,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.080
keeps the pipes

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.720
lasting longer.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.520
This stuff here, right?

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.160
Yeah, that's it!

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.600
OK,

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.160
lemme grab my phone

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.120
and record you

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:10.800
saying all that again.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.280
Don't bother, I'm around.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.160
Just let me know

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.120
if it acts up again.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.160
Was I yelling

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.000
too loud in the morning?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.240
Did I wake you?

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.640
Nah,

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.120
just jet lag.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.280
Keep dozing off

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.480
and waking up.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.240
Phew, this trash reeks,

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.800
gotta get it out!

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.640
Sure, I'll dump it now!

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.560
Not you,

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.680
I mean your dad.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.480
Zhang Jianbin!

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.120
Take this trash out!

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.600
Zhang Jianbin!

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.280
It's fine, I'll handle it.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.360
Not in the bathroom?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.720
Where'd he sneak off to?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.360
Wait, don't!

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.200
You'll get your hands all gross.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.320
Just let me tie it up.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:51.880
It stinks so bad!

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.680
Let me, let me!

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.480
I've got this.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.000
I'll toss it out.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.600
Your dad, work appears, he disappears!

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.360
I can do that...

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.200
Watch out

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.000
for the metal bits,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.400
don't get cut.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.760
I deal with this stuff all the time.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:10.800
Fine.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.320
Cool.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.600
I'll put it on

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.360
the balcony.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:13.880
Gimme.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.320
I'll dump the trash!

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.320
Just gonna change quick.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.680
Better wash your hands too.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.360
On it.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.720
Hang in there, pal.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.120
Dad!

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.040
Mom's been looking for you.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.040
What are you doing here?

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.080
Uncle Li's in a fix.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.720
Jianbin,

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.360
couldn't get a wink last night.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.040
Got this busted socket.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.960
Repair guy says

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.000
they gotta tear up

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.040
the wall.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.960
Just finished renovating the place,

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.160
this'll mess up

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.280
everything!

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:53.840
Right...

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.000
Got him not to smash the wall,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.200
but man,

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.160
his mouth never stopped.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.520
Drove me nuts!

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.400
So did he fix it or what?

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.760
Here's the thing, nope!

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.440
Couldn't even take a shower last night.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.000
Yeah.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.240
That's nothing,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.040
but it could kill you

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.000
if it shorts out!

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:14.960
What now?

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.120
Uncle Li, lemme give it a shot.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.600
Might be able to sort it out.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.680
Just old wiring

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.200
with some loose connections.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.040
Lucky,

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.440
they used flex wire before.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.880
I can still make it work.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.920
If it had

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.400
burned any more,

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.640
you'd be in real trouble,

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.920
would've had to tear the wall apart

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.840
and redo everything.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.560
I found a wobbly terminal

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.560
too, and

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.600
tightened it up.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.040
Should keep going for a while.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.640
Kid, you're a genius!

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.040
Fixed it

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.480
just like that!

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.240
That's my PhD boy!

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.280
This little

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:50.960
circuit box?

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.560
Nothing to him!

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.040
Gonna give that guy a one-star review.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.160
Where'd you find that guy anyway?

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.680
Total scammer!

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.560
My daughter

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.240
found him online,

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.400
a platform

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.680
called "ProFix."

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.920
Says it's

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.880
the hottest thing now,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.320
users everywhere!

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.640
Hey, kid, beats sitting around

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.240
at home,

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.600
you should do this!

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.680
Dad...

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.560
Sit, sit,

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.440
just saying,

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.520
Uncle Li's got

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.800
a good heart,

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.560
just doesn't think before he talks.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.000
Guy could turn a compliment

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.520
into an insult.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.080
I mean, seriously,

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.200
suggesting a foreign PhD like you

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.480
should be

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.120
a handyman?

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.640
Talk about wasting talents!

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.120
Don't sweat it, Dad.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.680
I'm just killing time anyway,

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.320
feels good to help fix

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.240
people's problems.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:04.920
No way!

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.640
A PhD's a PhD!

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.560
Better unemployed than undignified!

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.240
Ms. Qian, we're still good

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.400
with what we agreed on, right?

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.680
I can pick

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.320
my own direction?

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.440
Yeah,

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.360
but I really think

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.880
you should go with our strategy,

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.440
the whole

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.720
"Desperate Personal Shopper" character.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.680
I want to try

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.120
my own ideas.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:53.920
I mean,

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.960
I worked in TV,

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.200

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.520

Check this out.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.200
What's up?

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.800
Is this funny to you?

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.600
Is it?

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.240
I just don't get

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.600
why this stuff blows up.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.400
Why?

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:00.840
It's that big?

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.720
Huge.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.080
Hey, it's a crazy world.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.040
Gotta make room for

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.520
all kinds of stuff.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.280
There's gotta be something to it.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.800
Don't think it's funny either, huh?

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.200
Don't get it at all.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.040
How's this trash

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.080
going viral?

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.880
Should I try making these?

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.200
No joke!

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.120
Gotta think it through.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.640
Hey, why'd he close

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.000
my window of dream?

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.520
That fake cutesy voice!

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.120
So over-the-top,

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.680
Even worse than the last one.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.280
The one you liked

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.560
has 3,000 followers.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.720
This one's got a million.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.040
Never said I liked her.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.440
Just thought she was normal,

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.320
better than

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.040
this squeaky,

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.360
fake voice thing.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.840
What's her deal anyway...

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880
[Hi everyone,]

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.960
[Yuan Yuan here from]

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.800
["Today's Financial Interview."]

[Last time, we heard]

[business leaders'...]

Yuan Yuan, huh...

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.640
Who's this?

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.320
What's she yapping about?

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.000
Your voice is far superior.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.520
Everything's so different now.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.480
Back in our day,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.720
you needed real skills

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.960
to keep viewers

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.920
watching.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.400
Now...

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.080
I'm totally lost about

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.840
what audience like.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.200
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.800
When I went back to the company,

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.400
the manager told me

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.520
I have to post three videos a week.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.960
Once the fanbase

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.200
stabilizes,

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.280
I can switch to one a week.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.680
And after I hit 50 thousand followers

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.480
can I get brand deals.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.080
I thought coming back

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.600
I'd be back on track right away.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.400
I didn't expect this many steps.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.520
It's just a one-year contract.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.760
Why are there so many conditions?

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.200
Well, the company's investing in me.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.040
They're allowed

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.040
to set some terms, right?

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.560
I know

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.200
you really value this chance,

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.280
but don't run yourself

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.240
into the ground.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.320
Don't carry that much pressure.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.480
Worst case,

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.240
after a year we go back to Canada.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.560
I know.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.120
I'll give it a real shot.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.000
If it doesn't work, we'll talk then.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.440
Like I always say:

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.280
"Nothing is hard, if you just quit."

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.280
If it doesn't work out, we just drop it.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.520
You've got me.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.480
Listen to you, so tough.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.680
I should throw you out.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.840
I'm serious.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.400
You don't believe me?

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.720
Phone on charge. Sleep.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.320
With me here, what are you afraid of?

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.200
Lights out.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.280
This pillow is way too flat.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.440
I'll buy another one for you.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.000
Get you one as tall as a pyramid.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.680
Since we came back,

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.200
we still haven't gone to see your dad.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.520
We should visit your dad

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.640
and Li Daoqi's mom soon

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.880
to bring them the cod-liver oil.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.520
I already went.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.200
Something this big

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.280
and you went by yourself, without...

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.760
It's not a big deal.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:34.840
There's not that much

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.960
for me to say to them.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.280
I stayed 10 minutes

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:37.880
and left.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.320
You've got enough on your plate.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.840
Don't worry about this.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.360
Sleep.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.800
One, two, three.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.680
Does it have to be three years?

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:06.880
Of course.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.480
That's the timeline

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.840
we need to recover costs and

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.320
develop the account.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.280
Don't worry,

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.240
you won't find

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.880
another company in this business

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.360
with terms

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.560
as kind as ours.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.400
And after three years,

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:21.960
we can sit back down

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.200
and adjust

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.520
your revenue split

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.680
and percentages based on

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.760
how things are going.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.920
Nobody's getting shortchanged.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.520
Can't I just sign for one year?

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.480
For a total newbie,

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.800
standard contracts

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.040
start at three years.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.680
No company

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.240
would invest that much effort

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.160
in a short-term deal.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.760
you need

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.080
to follow this

00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.760
official account.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.640
Once you follow it,

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.600
we'll do

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.640
a quick real-name verification.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.680
You need that

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.480
before you can

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.360
buy tickets.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:10.720
Could I

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.880
see your ID, please?

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.160
We'll just get you verified.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.600
Sir?

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:15.960
Sir,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.920
your ID,

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.280
please?

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.560
[It's just scanning a code, isn't it?]

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.120
[What's taking so long?]

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.200
[How can scanning a code be this slow?]

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.920
You don't need all these cards.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.520
Here, let me help you.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.760
We follow

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.680
the account first.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.400
Then we

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.720
do a quick face scan.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.560
Just look at the screen.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.760
[Grandma, I don't want to eat this.]

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.400
[Being picky is bad for you.]

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.360
You'll never grow tall.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.480
When your parents come back

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.800
and see you short and skinny,

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.520
they'll blame me.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.000
When are my mom and dad

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.600
coming back?

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.800
How should I know?

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.800
["Have kids to guard your old age",]

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.640
[all nonsense.]

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.080
[You can't count on any of them.]

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.840
[I saw it with my own two eyes.]

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.320
[This old lady's eyes are just fine.]

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.880
[I was wondering]

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.760
[why my pigeons stopped eating.]

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.880
[Turns out your cat scared them.]

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.840
[You really]

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.000
[don't mean well.]

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.080
[My blue cat]

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.200
[is here to catch mice.]

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.480
[It has nothing]

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.520
[to do with your pigeons.]

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.360
[I'm telling you,]

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.960
[you're the one who doesn't mean well.]

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:16.920
[All these years]

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.080
[your pigeons have been]

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.040
[crapping everywhere.]

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.880
[Everyone in the alley's sick of it.]

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.720
[Do you know what it means]

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.320
when a pigeon poops on your clothes?

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.760
That's "luck from the sky".

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.280
I...

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.560
That's my pigeons

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.080
sending money to your house.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.480
You don't know

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.640
how to be grateful.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.640
Sooner or later, karma's coming for you.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.240
I'm getting karma?

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.560
You're the one who'll get karma.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.400
[How many years have you been here?]

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.560
[Has anyone come to see you?]

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.760
[You're an old lady all by yourself.]

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.680
[Who visits you, huh?]

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.280
[You...]

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.280
I'm an old lady alone?

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.400
You're insulting me.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.320
I'm not insulting you.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:48.880
Go on.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:49.920
You'll regret this.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.480
What are you doing?

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.560
Go on, insult me.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.560
If you dare touch my pigeons...

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.760
Let's just talk, okay?

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.960
You called me an old woman all alone.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.000
How am I alone, exactly?

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
I really will tear all this down today,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:57.800
I'm telling you.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.400
What?

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.440
You wouldn't dare!

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.560
And who are you?

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.880
He's my grandson.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.880
So what if he is?

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.080
Shoo.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
What are you doing?

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.480
This dog of yours isn't worth anything.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.440
And it's picky as hell.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.800
Your parents spoiled it rotten.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.520
Miss me?

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.360
Good.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.960
If it were worth money,

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.880
they'd just treat it as an asset.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.760
What do you eat?

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.640
What does he eat?

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.080
He won't eat this brand.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.480
This is the cheapest one.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.400
Having food is already good enough.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.600
If he won't eat, he can go hungry.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.760
Hey, come on, seriously?

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.800
Has the money arrived yet?

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.199
I went to the bank this morning,

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:09.480
nothing in the account yet.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:16.360
Which room am I in?

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:18.000
You?

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:19.679
Same room as before.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.600
The one you grew up in.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:23.920
The quilt's probably a bit damp

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.280
after all this time.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.800
Remember to take it up to the roof

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.400
and let it dry when the weather's nice.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.400
I tried calling the house,

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.040
couldn't get through.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.440
Bad signal.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:37.080
Oh, please. It's a landline.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.159
Is the phone broken?

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.239
No, I bought it only five years ago,

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:41.280
it's practically new.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.199
I'm going out to get pigeon feed.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.800
The phone line's not plugged in right.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.800
What am I supposed to eat?

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:53.040
Cook for yourself.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:57.640
Happy.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.160
Come here.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.080
Come here.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.200
You're heavy.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:45.800
[Hello?]

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:46.600
Hello?

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.200
[Kaiyang? Finally.]

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:49.880
Second Uncle.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.600
[You came back]

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.720
[and didn't even tell me]

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.320
[so I could pick you up at the airport.]

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.280
[Where are you staying?]

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.240
At Grandma's.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.640
[Good.]

00:35:59.200 --> 00:35:59.760
[Since]

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.160
[you're back,]

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.080
[we elders should]

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.640
[throw you a welcome meal tomorrow.]

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.120
I'm meeting a lawyer tomorrow.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.240
[Seeing a lawyer]

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.080
[doesn't take all day.]

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.240
[Let's do lunch tomorrow.]

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.080
[I'll call Third Uncle]

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.200
[and your aunt,]

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.200
[we'll all get together]

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.480
[and welcome you home properly.]

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.520
Got it.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.960
[We'll go to the one and only]

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.160
[Michelin restaurant in Lucheng City.]

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.280
[I'll send you the address later.]

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.320
[Oh, and just come by yourself.]

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.360
In Canada,

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.400
if the two of us sat down like this

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.360
for a bowl of malatang like today,

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.240
guess how much it would cost.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.440
How much?

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.920
60 Canadian dollars.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.680
Over 300 RMB.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.880
For malatang!

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.800
Daylight robbery, right?

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.200
That bad?

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.520
Yeah, China's still the best.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.280
Of course.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.800
So now that you're back,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.240
what about the apartment

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.120
your parents bought you in Canada?

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.720
Just going to leave it empty?

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.480
I rented it out.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.600
Rented it out?

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.240
Can't just let it sit there.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:00.960
I rented it to a classmate

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.480
who's still in Canada,

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.880
so at least we're not losing money.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.640
My ticket home this time

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.320
was basically paid for with the rent.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.720
Smart, huh?

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.960
Not bad.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.800
You're the clever one,

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.520
business mind and all.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.680
But I can't touch

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.760
any of that rent.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.120
I'm keeping it all for my parents.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.720
I just borrowed a tiny bit.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.200
I don't need to hear

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.800
any more of your humble bragging.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.120
Don't get all sarcastic on me.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.920
How am I being sarcastic?

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.560
A place here and a place overseas

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.640
and you're still not satisfied?

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.040
What about

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.440
all that money you lost

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.640
on that fake guarantor thing?

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.520
What are you going to do about that?

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.800
You're not just

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.720
writing it off, are you?

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.400
Don't get me started.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.680
I'm pretty sure those guarantor fees

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.480
are gone.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.720
But I think

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.760
I might get the lawyer fees

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.400
back.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.280
If I really push.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.280
After I came back,

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.960
I found

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.040
that Canadian lawyer

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.040
who scammed me

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.720
on a website.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.000
Let me show you

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.200
his picture.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:37:59.840
This guy.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.920
Doesn't his face

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.000
just scream scammer?

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.280
I found his firm,

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:07.840
some place called

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.240
Qizheng Law Firm.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.360
I've decided

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.720
I'm going to stake out his office.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.200
He conned me, I'll con him right back.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.360
I'll pretend to be a new client,

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.880
make up a fake name,

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.440
go in and discuss a case

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.320
and lure him out.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.720
I will get

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.480
that money back.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.720
You've really changed.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.520
You're nothing

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.480
like you were before.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:26.720
Cheers to that.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.560
But I

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.920
really am curious,

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.240
are you seriously

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.240
not going to tell your parents?

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.320
Once I find that lawyer

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.400
and prove I was scammed,

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.320
then I might still get back to Canada.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.480
I need to fix the mess I made first.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.440
I'll have something to say to them.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.120
I'm here to see him.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.320
What about him?

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.200
I want to hire him.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.880
Mr. Kuang?

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.040
Yes, he's one

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:52.920
of our firm's lawyers.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.600
But he's usually abroad,

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.280
not in Lucheng City.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.760
And he's currently on vacation.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.160
If you'd like,

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:58.960
I can recommend

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.040
a few other

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:00.880
excellent lawyers.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.840
How does that sound?

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.160
No, no.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.080
I only trust this Mr. Kuang.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.640
A friend recommended him,

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.640
said he's amazing.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.240
I...

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240
Could you

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.600
book a slot for me with him?

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.520
Of course.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.080
Let me take down your details first.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.480
How should I address you?

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.800
My surname is Chen.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.560
Chen,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.640
okay.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.200
Well,

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.320
Ms. Chen.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.080
I should remind you,

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.840
Mr. Kuang charges

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.240
by the hour for consultations.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.200
Fine.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.320
So when's the earliest

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.920
you could get me in?

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.280
Let me check.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:35.960
Okay.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.360
Sorry,

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.800
you can't look at this file.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.360
Let me see...

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.360
The soonest slot

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.880
with Mr. Kuang is

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.280
three months from now.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.440
Will that work?

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:55.920
That's no good.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.680
My case is really urgent.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.200
Can't you squeeze me in?

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.640
I really can't.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.160
I have to schedule strictly

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.640
according to the lawyers' calendars.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.800
So when he's on vacation,

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.360
he never comes into the office, right?

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.000
Oh, he does.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.520
He's vacationing next door.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.520
In that room.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.040
We bought tons of sand for him,

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.120
set up a big TV

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.520
that plays looping beach videos

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.320
with waves

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.760
and seagulls.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.960
Of course not.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.760
Who goes into work on holidays, right?

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.600
I'm kidding.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.400
You're pretty funny.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.120
We don't get many people here,

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.360
so I just chat with you for fun.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.000
Anything else I can help you with?

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.080
Yeah,

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.160
could you...

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.200
could you find me

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.160
one of Mr. Kuang's

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:39.840
business cards?

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.440
Sure,

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.320
there should be some.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.400
I'll take a look.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.120
Thanks.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.080
Not many people

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.960
still use business cards these days.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.080
Ah, here we go.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.360
Have a look.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.160
Thank you.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.000
The number on there

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.520
is actually this front desk phone.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.000
It'll still be me picking up.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.280
Got it.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:06.560
Okay,

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.960
if I need anything I'll call you.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.520
Great. Call me if you want to chat.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.400
Wait,

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.800
I still need to log your phone number.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.800
We didn't finish

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.480
the intake process.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.160
No need.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.960
Go enjoy the beach.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.000
It's just

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.120
our standard procedure here.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.640
I'll leave your name out.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.120
She's here to chat with me.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.000
Hello.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:40.840
Who are you looking for?

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:42.840
Mr. Luo.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.120
He's in a meeting.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.480
Why don't you wait in the lounge

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.240
for a bit?

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.280
I'll take you.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:49.880
Okay.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.240
Would you like something to drink?

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.040
I'm good.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.240
Water, tea, coffee?

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:55.960
Thank you.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.400
Mr. Luo,

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.680
your client is already in the lounge.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.160
Sorry,

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.640
sorry to keep you waiting.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.920
I had a pretrial this morning,

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.400
so it ran a little long.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:28.960
Sit.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.040
I'll keep it brief.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.000
Your parents have now decided

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:36.920
to have me represent

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.840
both of them.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.520
The case

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.760
is still in the investigation stage,

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.400
and I've already applied for bail.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.160
The total is seven million.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.280
Your family probably

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.200
can't put that together right now.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:46.560
But it's fine.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.440
Even if you could, there's no need.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.000
We'll need that money for other things.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:50.960
How many years will they get?

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:51.720
Sorry?

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:52.600
How long are they looking at?

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.600
Based on similar cases,

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.800
we're talking roughly 10

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.720
to 20 years.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.960
But your parents' case

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.320
is actually quite straightforward.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.640
The charge is illegal fundraising.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.880
With illegal fundraising,

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.840
that brings in the issue of returning

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.280
the money and compensating the victims.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.440
Our strategy is to at least wait

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.240
until the case is with the prosecutor.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.120
In this period,

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:12.880
you may get calls asking you

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.160
to return money or pay compensation.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.320
You don't need to take those calls.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.240
For now,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.600
your main job is

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.680
to contact relatives and friends

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.480
and see how much you can raise.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.160
Oh, and your family still has

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.680
some debts that haven't been collected.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.800
Go after those.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.600
They'll get a lighter sentence that way.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.480
Any other questions?

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.400
If not, I'll leave you here for now.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:34.680
Do you know my parents personally?

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:35.800
No.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:36.880
Look,

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:37.800
I'm well aware

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.240
your parents are important clients

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.600
of our firm,

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.520
but you may not know

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.360
all the details.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.040
How about this:

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.800
let me explain

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.840
while we're here.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.640
The fee you paid earlier only

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.960
covers the investigation stage.

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.120
If you want

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.320
to continue with me after that,

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.680
we're talking about

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.840
an additional six-figure fee.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.000
So...

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:00.520
I know.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.920
You mentioned it on the phone.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.000
Once the transfer goes through,

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:03.880
I'll pay.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.640
No problem.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:06.160
One more thing:

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.640
if that transfer

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.880
has any link

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.760
to Zhirong Garment Group,

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.200
the money may be clawed back later.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.600
It's my own money.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.480
All right then.

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:18.560
Right.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.360
I'll get back to work.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.240
Call me anytime.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.400
[Your online meeting has been booked.]

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:30.880
[Okay.]

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.440
[Well,]

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.440
[does he need to register?]

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.080
[Yes, register him.]

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.680
[And we bill him by the hour too?]

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.120
[Of course.]
