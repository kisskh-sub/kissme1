and swallow it.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.460
How was it?

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:55.870
It was scary.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.590
I saw the monkey in this painting come to life.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.630
I saw a monkey with a big piece

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.980
of Star Gold on its head.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.870
Moneygrubber.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.260
That's not right.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:10.740
In this vision,

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.020
we didn't see the monkey

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.070
come out of the painting.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.500
So that means the monkey we saw

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:16.590
was a human being in disguise?

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.350

You're awake.

Why did you react so violently?

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.110
I was too abrupt.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:58.760
Don't talk about it

00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.430

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.630
I saw my parents killed

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:01.980

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.220
I told you we were alike.

We grew up suffering,

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.300
and we're all

in the same situation.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.500
When I was little, my family was also victimized by bad people.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.540
I've been living on the streets

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.260
since I was a kid,

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.350
so we should be

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.390
close.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.390
Did you pull on your wound?

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.500
Why don't you hold yourself up?

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.300
I'm not in pain here

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.190
but here.

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.350
Don't pretend.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.670
It hurts.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.190
You really don't care about me?

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.350
Let me ask you a question.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.110
If I was the one who went crazy,

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.110
would you protect me

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.460
like Gu Tian?

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.390
Would you?

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.460
If you didn't save me,

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.940
my father would be all alone,

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.500
so he definitely wouldn't let you go.

Here, here.

Here, and here.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.300
There are

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.260
thirteen differences in all.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.700
The ink colors are all darkening.

Trust me.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.320
All the famous artists in Xichuan

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.350
have been hired by my father as tutors.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.150
I'm a connoisseur

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.190
when it comes to paintings.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.830
This painting is a fake made

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.390
by the ancient method of smudging.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.260
Many counterfeiters

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.670
use this technique to deceive people.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.150
People hang the painting

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:06.740
or calligraphy

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.110
in a relatively closed room

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:09.910
and bake it with the smoke

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.740
from the incense.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.350
After a few days of baking,

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.870
the paper will take

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.350
on a light brownish-yellow color.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.910
It's extremely similar to old paper,

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.300
so I didn't see anything wrong

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.190
with it before.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:25.630
But now,

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.140
because the painting has been roasted by fire,

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.940
the potion on the paper continues to work.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.110
You see.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.500
The color just isn't right.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.460
It seems to have aged

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.460
another several decades.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.980
The painting was mounted on a scroll first,

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.870
so the paper inside the scroll

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:48.940
wasn't smudged.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.670
Open up this scroll,

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:52.500
and then you can see if it's real.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.540
Look.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:14.770
Don't move.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:17.940

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.300
I've got it.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.780
This is datura flower and aconite root.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.540
This scroll was soaked in herbs.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.220
And then?

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.950
Datura flower and aconite root

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.300
are toxic and hallucinogenic.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.670
And, when exposed to heat,

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:45.540
the toxins are released

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.870
and cause hallucinations.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.540
So that's what Qin Shi

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.020
was smelling.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:52.830

I have so many ways of torturing people

Probably under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.820
Datura flower and aconite root are strong.

If you're not careful,

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.300
you'll fall into a hallucinogenic state,

Datura flower and aconite root are poisonous,

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.070
Let me continue.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.070
Wait a minute.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.510
That's not necessary.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.220
It wouldn't be worth it

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:12.900
if you hurt your back,

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.860
would it?

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.860
Why don't you

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.150
have some grapes

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.510
or sit over there

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.300
with some tea?

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:20.990
Young Mistress, what do you mean by that?

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.030
Are you looking down on me?

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.420
I'm old,

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.590
but I still have energy.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.590
Let me continue.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.070
Master Wang.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:39.420
There's something not right

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:40.910
with the monkey you drew.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:41.470
What?

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.190
Something's wrong?

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.340
Let me see

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:44.310
what's wrong.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.120
I didn't expect this monkey

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.670
to have two dull eyes.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.150
Maybe it didn't get enough to eat.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.900
A mess.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:54.980
How dare you call yourself a painter?

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:55.510
What...

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:56.470
What do you know?

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.780
This is splashed-ink freestyle painting.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.590
I didn't realize

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.950
you called yourself

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.220
Xichuan's chief painter,

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.030
but your painting is...

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.070
Is what?

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.220
Nothing.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:07.900
What...

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:09.820
What do you know?

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.510
I'm imitating the ancient method.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.190
A shallow person like you

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.260
can't even understand it.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:15.740
You...

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.700
You always talk

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.070
better than you act.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.820
Shut up.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.900
I invited you here to see

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.780
who copied this picture

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.700
not to argue.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.380
You're all swindling

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.780
in the name

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.300
of Lord's Mansion.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.260
Listen up.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.030
If you can't find this man,

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.380
you can all get out of Xichuan.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:36.420
Young Mistress.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.220
Please don't be angry.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.510
The lines in this painting are clean.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:41.590
It's hard to find the source

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.670
of this technique.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.510
It's not for mundanes like us

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.470
to do.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.550
Outrageous.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.670
Nonsense.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:50.550
I don't know

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.820
who could have done this painting,

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:54.070
but I've seen the same brushstrokes

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.190
and ink colors on another painting.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.860
Where is it?

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.820
Chunyun House.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:01.070
Chunyun House?

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.470
How does it feel?

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.990
Very good.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.240
Physician Fu's medical skills

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.700
are truly renowned.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:25.510
Good.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.740
The prescription is complete.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.950
You only need to follow the prescription

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.340
to remove the phlegm and dizziness.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.260
In a few days,

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.300
you'll be cured.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:35.700
Master.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.820
Master, emergency.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:37.590
Don't be rude.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.070
Jiu, calm down.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:41.820
What's going on?

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:42.510
Young Mistress...

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.420
Young Mistress has gone to Chunyun House.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:46.950
What?

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.040
Lord, don't panic.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:49.780
You...

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.470
Go.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.070
Probably something about the case was found.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:56.740
How about this?

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:58.860
Fu Sheng and I will go and have a look.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.670
We don't want to trouble you.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.700
Here's the prescription.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.700
Picking the medicine is more important.

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:06.340
Hurry up.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.260
Let's go.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:19.380
How's it going?

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:20.220
Is it?

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:23.380
Young Mistress.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:25.630
Descending Lion

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.860
is the same as the Golden Monkey

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.110
we see today in terms of brushwork

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.030
and ink colors.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.590
Is this by Li Ye?

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:34.470
It should be.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.420
That's great.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.350
Who is Li Ye?

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:38.550
He's such a good painter

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.630
but not well-known in Xichuan.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.630
Li Ye is Li Zhi's grandson.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.470
After Li Zhi's death,

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:47.510
his son wasn't good at painting,

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:48.820
so the family business fell into decline.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.260
In Li Ye's generation,

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.630
his father wanted him to revitalize the family.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.900
Li Ye practiced his painting skills

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.030
and became a painter.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.190
He was from a famous family.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.740
His paintings are not expensive now, are they?

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:00.860
Do you want to get a windfall again?

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:02.740
No, I don't.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.110
Li Ye's paintings aren't expensive.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.260
No,

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:06.900
they're worthless.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.950
Every year, no one invites him

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:09.990
to the Xichuan painters' party.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:11.860
Over time, he lost his fame.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.550
His paintings have been in idle.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.380
Why?

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.550
People said he was eccentric

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.420
and uncaring,

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.740
so no one wanted to talk to him.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.780
The old gentleman who painting freely today

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.630
once judged him in public

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:25.630
and said he could never

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:26.780
match his grandfather

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.740
in any way in his life.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.600
But it's a great painting,

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.190
so how did he end up in that?

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:32.820
Because Li Ye painted

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.190
a Monkey With A Hat

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.700
on Master Wang's birthday

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.990
to mock him for having only a nice look

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.220
instead of real skills.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.510
Master Wang was so angry that he scolded Li Ye in public

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.900
and said that he was obsessed with women

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.070
and had a narrow mind.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.260
Even if he was good at painting,

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.070
he would never become a famous artist.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.590
Since then, the painters in the city

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:50.740
have not gotten along with him.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:52.590
These painters in the city

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.900
are just jealous.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.820
He paints better

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.150
than those

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:58.340
so-called famous painters

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:58.990
even when he's drunk.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:05.070
Where is Li Ye now?

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.950
[Douhua]

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.790
Aren't we going to look for Li Ye?

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.220
Why are we eating here?

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.030
Please.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.950
What time is it?

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.070
My stomach has been wailing.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.260
If I don't eat,

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.190
I won't last long enough

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:26.470
to see Li Ye.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.260
Okay. Just eat.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.150
Don't forget to bring some to Wen Jue when you're done,

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.380
so she doesn't get upset.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:36.670
Fu Sheng.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.470
Have you ever wondered

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.740
why Wen Jue went to the other side of the street

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.220
to buy you watermelons?

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.470
Didn't she say so?

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.340
She's been eating that since she was a kid.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.260
It's the best thing to eat

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.220
in Xichuan.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.070
What's wrong?

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.380
Do you think that's just food?

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.070
Think back.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.260
Since we came to Xichuan,

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.740
how much good food did she buy you?

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.420
Haven't you figured it out yet?

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.070
What do you mean?

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.420
She's trying to control your stomach with food

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.080
to keep you here.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.430
Do I need you to remind me?

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.700
I can treat her father

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:19.900
only if I stay.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.340
You still don't get it.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.030
Get what?

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.470
He's coming.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:33.510
Who?

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.420
Why don't you dance anymore?

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:10.820
No one appreciates it,

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:12.550
so I don't want to dance.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:16.950
Is not being appreciated

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:18.070
the reason why you don't dance?

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.590
Well.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.300
Then I'll dance.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.300
Let's go.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.110
Get down to business.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:32.150
We're not waiting for Wen Jue?

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:33.860
She'll be waiting for us

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.150
when she gets back.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.550
Let's make this quick.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.550
You don't even let me eat.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.640
Prepare ink for me.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:55.050
Good.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.010
Two coins for one cabbage.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.240
Let her pay.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:02.610
Madam, here you are.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.330
Come and see.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.040
Come and see.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.310
He's holding a cabbage.

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.410
Bravo.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.680
- Bravo. - Bravo.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.560
- Bravo. - Bravo.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:03.440
What's wrong, beauty?

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.410
You didn't dance.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:06.850
Won't you let me dance?

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:07.850
It's a waste of it.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.410
The painting should be framed.

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:11.930
Why?

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:14.730
It will bring you wealth.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.000
Wealth?

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.210
What do you want?

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:31.540
Forget about wealth.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:32.240
It's a good painting.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.170
It's fake.

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:35.090
It's all fake.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.650
Is the painting also fake?

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:44.580
Let's go.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:49.760
Who are you?

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.050
My name is Fu Sheng.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.880
I want to ask you about a painting.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.800
What painting?

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:58.530
Golden Monkey.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.170
My grandfather is dead.

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.050
You can ask him.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:10.650
You drew the Golden Monkey.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.850
Are you a painter?

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.050
I'm a physician.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:33.320
Xichuan is big.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.680
But only a physician admires my painting.

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:38.680
Pathetic.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.810
Pathetic.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.000
Why did you poison the painting?

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.800
I gave them a chance.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.490
If they believed me,

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:51.360
they wouldn't have died.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.320
Let's talk somewhere else.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.170
Is there any good wine there?

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:07.410
It's better than your wine.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.050
Okay.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.680
What are we waiting for?

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.280
Go.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:11.700
Take me there.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.570
Keep up with him.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.610
Let's go.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.760
It's really good wine.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.200
Good wine.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:29.590
Do you want to drink it?

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.970
You should trade for it.

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:34.760
I'll just drink one bowl.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.460
I'll tell you after drinking.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.520
You've had a drink.

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:49.250
Tell us about it.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.720
Five years ago,

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.160
Master Lin

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:58.320
got my painting,

00:35:58.610 --> 00:35:59.720
the Golden Monkey.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.400
It was his birthday.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:04.640
So he took out the painting

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.160
and showed it to everyone.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.930
Guess what?

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.280
Everyone praised it.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.930
Everyone praised Li Zhi for his good painting skills

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:17.610
and the auspicious connotations of the painting.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.190
I told them

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.280
the painting was fake,

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.890
and I painted the real thing.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.400
Guess what?

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.160
Not only did no one believe me,

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.850
but they kicked me out.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.660
Was you the one

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:44.210
who put datura flowers and aconite roots

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:45.400
in the fake Golden Monkey?

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.560
Yes.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.160
Using datura flowers and aconite roots as dyes

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.130
not only gives the painting

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.920
a tawny, ancient effect

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.250
but also makes the painting less perishable.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:01.920
Did you

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.250
kill them?

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.130
They were fame-seekers

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.250
who couldn't tell the fake from the real.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.210
They deserved to die.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.440
So,

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.150
Song Jingye

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.730
was also killed by you, right?

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:26.040
No.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:26.920
No.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.610
Datura flowers and aconite roots can only cause hallucinations.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.520
I heard

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.250
Chairman Song was cut up.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.130
My hands

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.800
are for painting

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.330
and hugging beautiful women.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.400
They can't kill people

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.330
and cut up bodies.

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:50.010
Besides,

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.920
I didn't go to the Lin's Mansion that night.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.940
Who killed Song Jingye then?

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.850
They were up to no good.

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:07.640
They killed each other.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:10.610
Who was the murderer?

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.090
The person at the scene

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.280
was the murderer.

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.280
Who was in the Lin's Mansion

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.250
that night

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.130
except Song Jingye and Hulu?

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.160
It couldn't be Hulu.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:23.440
He wouldn't lie.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:26.250
Don't worry.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.850
We all believe in Hulu.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.130
When I get back,

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.400
I'll ask Jiu to investigate it.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:32.680
Fu Sheng.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.330
I suddenly remembered someone

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:36.330
we had missed.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:39.090
Do you remember

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.160
who found us

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:43.800
following Song Jingye?

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:48.800
Qin Shi.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:15.740
I'll see

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:16.900
who you are.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.280
[The animals in the show are props]

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.580
