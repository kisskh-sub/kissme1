How is Mr. Li?

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.850
Don't worry.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.850
He's fine now.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.620
Mr. Li is truly blessed by the heavens.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.460
He's not destined to die here.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.410
Your Majesty,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.890
Mr. Li is out of danger.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.540
The name of Ghost King

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.050
is now renowned across the martial world.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.820
Judging by the relationship between Lingbi Sect and Nanrong Palace,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.290
I suspect that the assassination of Li Chengtian is just the start.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.020
Instead of letting Lingbi Sect teach us what to do,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.930
we should act on our own initiative.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.500
Greetings, Young Lady.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.780
You all were once my father's subordinates.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.890
Now,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.890
Father has been killed by a despicable villain.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.170
Although she's the Imperial Preceptor,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.010
she has complete control of the court

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.940
and has plunged the world into chaos.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.940
We have to rectify the situation as soon as possible.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.450
I've sent my men to summon Jueding back to the palace.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.780
Were there any strange movements within the court

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.850
or the martial world?

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.170
My Lady,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.380
a rumor has been circulating within the martial world.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.380
What rumor?

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.170
The Ghost King has appeared.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.980
All right.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.340
I understand.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.780
You all may go.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.130
Yes, My Lady.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.130
The Ghost King of Lingbi

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.340
was no more after Master's passing.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.820
Where did this new Ghost King come from?

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.220
Could it be...

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.570
Although this is a branch of Lingbi Sect,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.820
the Ghost King

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.450
is here.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.850
That means this branch is the most prominent.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.170
You all have joined us as fresh maidservants.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.580
You all must obey the rules.

Yes, madam.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.700
What are you doing here?

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.140
It's all my fault.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.020
I got lost

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.260

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.850
Go away!

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.290
Yes, madam.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.330
How dare you leave the team without permission?

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.500
And, you almost barged into the sect's sacred ground as well.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.410
It seems you have a death wish.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.530
You shall kneel and hold this lantern the entire night.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.060

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.770
Yes, madam.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.940
You're quite a handful, aren't you?

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.060
Don't worry.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.330
The wax of the Tear-Concealing Candle burns like fire.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.700
You'll just get a minor burn.

Commander,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.260

This is His Majesty's instruction.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.090
Yes, Commander.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.810

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.650
Saintess,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.260
should we acknowledge the Ghost King?

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.380
Do you know what this is?

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.140
It's a willow tree.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.500
This willow

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.140
is called Heartless Willow.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.020
On top of it

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.380

You were already poisoned.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.140
Do you think

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.890
I'll poison you again?

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.340
I swear eternal loyalty to you, Saintess.

You guys aren't loyal to me.

You guys are loyal to these bugs.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.620
The Moon-Eclipse is the most potent poison I've created.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.650
That's also exactly what I wanted.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.140
The Ghost King has resurfaced.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.770
If he does possess the Moon-Eclipse,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.860
that means

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.770
he'll be my personal possession.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.650
So, you met the ghostly messenger under her?

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.450
Indeed.

She's the most loyal ghostly messenger under her.

Are you sure we can take advantage of her?

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.850

according to the leads on the silver coin.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.820
But the place was already empty when we got there.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.420
They even set up explosive traps,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.060
causing us to suffer countless casualties.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.650
I managed to survive narrowly.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.460
First, they robbed you guys.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.850
After that, they gave you guys fake leads

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.650
to lure you into the traps they had set up at Fenglai Pavilion.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.370
This bait-and-switch move

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.370
was executed brilliantly. Don't you think?

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.730
I deserve to die because of my fault!

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.010
I'm sure an expert is guiding them from behind.

I've underestimated Fenglai Pavilion.

As far as we currently understand,

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.980
From today onward,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.490
you and I

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.250
will cut all ties.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.220
Your Highness, you didn't attend the morning court session.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.060
It turns out that you're here,

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.770
fretting over your lost love.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.700
Preceptor Du,

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.650
you should mind your own business.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.700
I don't mind

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.980
getting another obedient lackey from Nanrong Palace

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.580
and allowing him

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.760
to enjoy the fun of being the next Imperial Preceptor.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.340
I came to find you

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.490
because I have some business

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.580
with you.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.250
Du Tingxin!

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.610
You think I don't dare to kill you?

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.420
If you capture a bird with a fiery personality,

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.580
there's no way you can trap it in a cage.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.420
It'll think of everything it can to escape.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.060
It will only give up after ramming itself to death

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.490
in the cage.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.180
Your Highness, please be appeased.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.180
But I have a way

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.250
for you to keep her by your side.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.530
I can turn her

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.850
into your personal doll.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:42.340
She'll be obedient,

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.100
charming,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.580
and will only answer to you.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.850
She won't betray you

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.010
no matter what happens.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.850
And, from now on,

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.420
you're the only thing in the world

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.890
that matters to her.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.460
In the future, you can dress her up like your personal doll.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.700
She'll smile and cry

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.010
when you want her to.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.460
If you tell her to say "I love you",

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.010
she'll say it...

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.140
for all eternity.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.700
Physician Li,

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.570
I brought a buddy of mine to test your medicine...

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.480
Do not speak!

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.660
It's completed!

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.140
Hurry and feed your buddy with it.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.050
Okay.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.860
Here.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.140
How can this be?

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.700
Try ringing the Heartbane Bell.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:37.810
My heart no longer hurts.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.650
Young man,

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.010
are you sure about that?

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.860
Yes, sir.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.770
I succeeded.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.620
I succeeded!

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.730
- You actually succeeded. - Yeah!

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.290
We finally managed to live up to His Majesty's expectations

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.750
and created the antidote to Heartbane.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.270
Hurry and produce the antidote according to this prescription.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.160
Yes, sir.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.730
You guys actually succeeded.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.050
Ghost King will never

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.290
go back on his promise.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.090
Why are you guys helping us out?

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.420
Ghost King said

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.360
that one can never truly dominate people with poison.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.220
Someone said the same thing to me once.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:13.570
Who is it?

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.420
It's a friend of mine.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.730
Her name is Dienu.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.530
She was also once a member of Lingbi Sect.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.090
But now,

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.490
no one remembers her name anymore.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.050
She's already dead.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.700
She was killed by Heartbane

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.420
in her attempt to regain freedom.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.050
She once told me to escape with her.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.660
But I was terrified of the heart-consuming pain.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.530
I betrayed her.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.290
Don't tell me

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.620
you would rather be affected by Heartbane for the rest of your life.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.570
Between freedom and life,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.460
make your choice.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.490
She chose to protect her freedom

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.140
by jumping off the cliff

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.900
while I managed to get by,

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.490
albeit leading a regretful life.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.180
It's all in the past now.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.440
Is that so?

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.380
Perhaps everything would've been different

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.490
had I encountered Ghost King sooner.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:06.810
Your Majesty,

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.010
everything has been arranged for.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.180
Excellent.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.980
The day we storm the Sacred Hall

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.980
is the day of the Saintess's death.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.330
As per your instructions,

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.860
I've jotted down

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.770
her food preferences, address,

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:21.700
hobbies, habits,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.010
everything that's related to her.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.720
[Daily Necessities: Pear blossom, especially fond of honey puffs]

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.180
But are these details actually important?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.140
I thought we were going to...

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.250
Pear blossom?

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.660
[Especially fond of honey puffs]

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.730
Fond of honey puffs?

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.900
What's the matter?

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.490
It's nothing.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.900
Where's Cangcang?

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.140
Her Majesty is still trying to locate you.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.520
How's the situation in the palace?

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.660
Prince of Yuzhang acted as if he had no interest in handling court affairs.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.330
But after my investigation, I found out

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.090
he has already transferred his personal guards in Southern Chu

00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.980
to the Capital secretly.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.220
[Changhe Gate]

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:13.700
Your Highness.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.420
What's wrong?

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.330
Princess Zhong Lin was taken away by the Imperial Preceptor.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.570
Just now, I had a dream.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.810
It was as if I fell into a pool of black water.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.330
It was terrifyingly cold.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.900
It was just a nightmare.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:37.290
You don't need to take it to heart.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:38.530
Is that so?

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.620
So, it was just a dream.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:46.900
Zhong Lin,

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.010
the palace is no longer safe.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.660
Du Tingxin is growing increasingly ruthless.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:53.730
I don't know what'll happen after this.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.870
Just stay with me in the palace.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.620
Let's be together

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.250
for the rest of our lives, okay?

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.250
Put me down.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.250
I have something to tell you.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.380
Zhong Lin,

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.980
what are you up to?

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.040
Xiao Qianqing.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.600
Please don't attempt such folly.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.420
Let me go.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.230
Trust me. I won't bring harm to you.

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:53.810
If so, in the future, we can still...

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.570
I don't want to wait any longer.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.090
Let me go.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.660
Aunt Chan served Mother.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:07.980
And now, she's missing.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:10.940
If you want to show me the truth,

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.730
you must present your evidence.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:24.140
Arrest the assassin!

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.290
- Hurry! - Hurry!

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.050
We were late to your rescue.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.090
Your Highness, please pardon us!

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.730
Relay my order.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.770
Zhong Lin tried to assassinate me.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.250
Seal off all the palace gates.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.980
Arrest the assassin.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:43.010
Yes, Your Highness!

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.860
Over here!

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.090
Come with me!

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.730
Hurry! Over there!

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.090
Search the area!

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.530
Search over there!

00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:59.730
You guys, follow me!

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.250
Did you guys find her?

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.180
Not yet.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.250
Dispatch all of the Imperial Guards.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.250
Find her

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.530
at all costs.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.180
Yes, Your Highness!

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:23.010
Your Highness.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.220
Escort Zhong Lin out of the palace in secret.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.180
Yes, Your Highness.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.900
I also made a discovery just now.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.980
Preceptor Du has left the palace.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.660
Stop right there!

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:12.050
You,

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.180
wait here for me.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.140
This is the Prison of Thousand Threads that I had awakened with your blood.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.730
Keep it for ten days.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.820
After that, put it in the body of the person you wish to control.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:48.300
The target will lose consciousness

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.340
and fall under your complete control eventually.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.380
Thank you, Saintess.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.820
Saintess, I always wanted

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.620
to ask you a question.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:12.930
What is it?

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.140
Why go out of your way to help me?

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.210
Is it only because I'm the daughter of your savior?

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.100
Xin,

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.930
I may have lost most of my memories,

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.140
but I never forgot about your mother.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.010
Back then,

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.930
I was just a junior disciple in Lingbi Sect.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:51.300
But your mother?

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.780
She was the most spiritually gifted sacred maiden

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.340
chosen from the Imperial family.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.650
Even so, we were the best of friends.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:01.860
Sui and I

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.820
roamed the lands with our swords.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.860
Those days were satisfying

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.580
to say the least.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.170
Sui.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.410
What actually happened

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.860
all these years?

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.580
How come I can't remember any of them?

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.860
The elders said

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:45.170
I went berserk while trying to master

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.490
the divine art of Lingbi,

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.060
causing me to lose my memories.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:51.820
But,

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.210
it felt like I've lost much more than that.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.650
What are they?

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.580
What exactly have I lost?

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.580
Who is he?

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.210
Who is this child?

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.450
Why does he

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.060
keep appearing in my head?

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.100
Your Highness,

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.930
this is a list of palace maids

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.410
found in Nanrong Palace.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.820
[Register of Palace Attendants' Return, Liu Chan, Lin Nianwei]

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:57.690
Preceptor Du,

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.270
our scouts managed to track down Ling Cangcang's whereabouts on the outskirts.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.430
We've already dispatched our men to capture her.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.850
Zhong Lin.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.060
Hand this letter to Xiao Qianqing.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.490
Hurry and leave!

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:19.010
Just go!

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:19.730
Cangcang!

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:21.580
Over there!

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.060
It's you?

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.780
Did he tell you to rescue me?

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.580
Where is he?

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.820
I don't know.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.620
You don't know?

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.170
Why is he avoiding me?

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.620
Li Hongqing,

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:11.650
this is an order.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.010
Take me to him immediately.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.780
You shouldn't have been here.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:36.340
Were you the one who left the white umbrella at the inn?

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.490
Were you the one at Lingbi Sect's branch?

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.380
Are you

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.170
the Ghost King?

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.210
How long do you intend to avoid me?

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:48.250

you're in a perilous spot now.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:22.900
You must act cautiously.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.140

Ghostly messenger, lead the way.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:16.530
Ghost King has arrived.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.780
Greetings, Ghost King.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.340
So, you are Ghost King?

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.660
That's right.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.970
I am Ghost King.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:04.900
I knew you harbored ulterior motives.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.530
You have a death wish.

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:40.340
How dare you guys betray me?

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.220
Could it be

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:46.340
that you guys have forgotten

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.970
about the pain of Heartbane?

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.970
Did you cure them of Heartbane?

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:13.860
Indeed.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.380
Heartbane, the poison that I've invented,

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:18.410
it has no cure.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.610
That's because

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.220
you never wanted to cure them from the start.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.180
Ghost King managed to create an antidote

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.180
and neutralize the poison for them.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.260
Why else do you think

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:27.900
they're betraying you?

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.410
It seems you've plotted for this day for a long time.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.260
Who exactly are you?

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.010
I'm your undertaker.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.490
Dienu.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.740
I've made my choice as well,

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.530
even though I might only be free at this exact moment.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.530
I suppose that's enough.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.410
You're truly beyond salvation.

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:15.820
Those who betray the sect

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.740
don't deserve to live.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:21.660
Mother,

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.300
I'm so cold.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.410
Huan, be a good boy.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.490
You won't be cold after you take the medicine.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:29.200
Mother,

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.740
it's so bitter.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:36.200
Why am I the only one who's suffering like this?

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:40.090
Why am I the only one who has had to take medicine from a young age?

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.050
It's all my fault.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.740
I failed to protect you.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.970
Here, Huan.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.090
I'll give you some honey puffs

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.820
after you finish your medicine,

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.610
okay?

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.380
Here.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:06.960
Why do you have this tattoo?

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:15.520
Did you visit the Central Plains

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.590
over two decades ago?

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.900
Have you been to Great Qi

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:25.610
over two decades ago?

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:34.900
Have you...?

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.570
Why is my child afflicted

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.610
with cold-related ailments since his birth?

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.570
Why must it be him?

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.610
Why must he suffer like this?

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.130
You have to leave the palace as soon as possible.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.930
You can save Huan

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.570
only if you find the Frost Reed.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.380
This is a fake-death decoction I made for you.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.660
The only way you can leave the palace

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.930
is to drink this.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:50.130
Kill me.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:00.090
Kill me if you dare.

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.860
Do you think you can rule over Lingbi Sect

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.490
just because you've defeated me?

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.570
You're getting ahead of yourself.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.340
When the full moon shines,

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.860
the Ghost King returns to his tomb.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.180
If you want to end everything before that happens,

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.860
kill me right now!
