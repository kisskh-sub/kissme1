00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.160
What should we do with him?

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.640
Take him away.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.120
Kneel down.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.200
Sir.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.080
Minister Ming.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.680
Child trafficking, selling offices,
forgery, slander—

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.560
These three major crimes together.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.840
This violates our nation's laws.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.960
You—

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.240
Do you admit your guilt?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.000
Minister Liu.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.800
I don't understand what you mean.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.520
These ledgers were seized from your home.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.360
Are you still trying to deny it?

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.200
And—

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.120
This ink-erasing potion—

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.600
You used it to frame General Qiao.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.720
Evidence of illegal money lending.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.160
I confiscated these

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.640
during the search.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.120
They were meant

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.400
to convict He Zhaoyin.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.520
I didn't expect

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.920
Minister Liu would discover it first.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.560
This matter—

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.640
What does it have to do with He Zhaoyin?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.840
Minister Liu is still young.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.400
These matters—

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.160
I've investigated for a long time.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.840
The evidence is solid.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.040
Since

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.840
Minister Liu is eager for merit,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.320
then I

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.080
will go along with it.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.800
This is the culprit's confession.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.360
Minister Liu, please keep it safe.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.000
So Minister Ming admits

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.200
the fisher girl's case

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.480
and the illegal lending case

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.200
were both misjudged?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.040
Anyone can make mistakes.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.000
We should at least ask about it.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.200
I ordered it done.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.360
That is

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.680
in accordance with protocol.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.160
Isn't that right, Minister Rui?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.800
Yes.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.320
I just didn't expect

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.280
Minister Ming to cut ties so quickly.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.840
How can you call it

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.600
cutting ties?

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.440
It makes me look

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.560
like I'm forming factions.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.480
Isn't that so,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.560
Minister Liu?

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.440
About He Zhaoyin—

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.000
Please

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.280
investigate further.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.200
If there's nothing else,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.040
I'll return to rest.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.960
Ming Qiuhai.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.200
How dare you!

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.760
Sir.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.160
He Zhaoyin hanged himself at home.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.480
Minister Liu, is there anything else?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.400
Nothing.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
You all may leave.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.720
Get up.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.160
Go.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.200
He Zhaoyin—

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.320
hanged himself at home.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.800
And—

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.920
he left a confession letter.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.000
He said all of this

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.720
was his doing.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.640
I'm sorry.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.520
I couldn't help you.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.000
I'm glad the two generals were cleared.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.640
When can they be released?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.160
Leave it to me.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.880
In three days.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.560
Thank you.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.640
Your Majesty.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.480
Princess Chunxi has arrived.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.440
Second Young Master Rui entered the palace too.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.920
Yes.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.960
Your humble servant—

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.640
came to escort the princess back.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.440
Royal brother—

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.360
I brought you buns from outside.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.600
Would you like to try one?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.600
If you hadn't said so, I'd have forgotten.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.320
Princess Chunxi is getting bold now.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.960
Her token was confiscated,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.760
yet she still left the palace.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.400
Don't be angry, royal brother.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.000
Li Quan.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.920
Yes.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.080
Assign someone to watch the princess.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.320
After copying the Diamond Sutra ten times,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.520
send it to the Empress Dowager's palace.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.520
It's for the Empress Dowager's meditation.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.640
Show some filial piety.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.800
Ten times? That's too much!

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.400
Twenty times.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.160
Twenty times.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.240
Ten times, ten times, ten times!

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.320
Your sister takes her leave.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.680
Go, go, go.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.080
Yes.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.040
Young master.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.320
Your Highness, wait for this old servant!

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.280
Master Rui.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.880
Are you enjoying the festivities?

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.720
Very much.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.800
No—

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.120
How could a humble servant dare?

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.800
I'll take my leave now.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.000
Go ahead.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.880
I take my leave.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.480
Why isn't she back yet?

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.200
Sir, sir!

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.360
Where is Madam?

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.120
I went to find Second Young Master.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.920
He said he met Madam in the east alley this afternoon.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.560
Then they parted ways.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.000
He said Madam went after someone.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.880
I checked the teahouse and tavern he frequents.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.040
I searched them all.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.080
Couldn't find her.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.760
Not bad skills.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.640
Too bad he's a petty thief.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.880
Taking advantage of others.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.920
Utterly shameless.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.840
You're just a coward who bullies kids.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.920
If my royal brother hadn't spared you,

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.480
for kidnapping little Chongguang,

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.240
I'd have cut you to pieces long ago.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.040
Kidnapping—

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.640
You'll stay in Wurong forever,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.960
as a slave.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.320
I—

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.920
Why are you here?

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.320
Second Young Master.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.240
I'm Qiuhong, the princess's maid.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.000
The princess asked me to give this to you.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.560
Thank you.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.240
Why didn't you

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.800
knock and come inside to talk?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.640
The princess said

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.000
she snuck out of the palace

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.480
and caused you all a lot of trouble.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.040
She told me not to disturb anyone here.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.400
If you have something to say to her,

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.880
I can pass the message for you.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.280
I...

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.960
It's nothing.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.440
Yes.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.320
Please tell her for me:

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.320
When she can leave the palace,

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.160
I'll take her

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.240
to eat grilled fish.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.400
Okay.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.840
Bad fox.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.160
I left the palace without permission

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.160
and my brother made me copy scriptures.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.720
The New Year is coming.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.040
I'm afraid I won't get to see you again soon.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.520
I have to wait until after the fifteenth to ask him to let me out.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.280
I've been reading the Scenery Collection lately

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.200
and realized there are many sights I haven't seen.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.200
Someday,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.800
will you take me to see the vast mountains and rivers?

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.040
This cloak is my thank-you gift to you.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.040
And about Brother Chenxiao,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.200
please help me apologize to him.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.400
I'm the one who caused you trouble.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.920
Please don't forget me.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.760
I'll find a chance to come out for sure.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.640
Yanluo.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.240
What a fateful mess.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.960
It's been three days.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.880
Any news of Chenxiao?

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.160
I'm about to go to the Hidden Pavilion for updates.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.840
At the city gates these days,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.960
among the passing merchants,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.040
there's no sign of him.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.680
But a Wurong caravan left the capital.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.720
I've sent people to investigate along the way.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.080
Wait a bit longer for news.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.720
Yu'er.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.000
Yu'er.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.520
It's gotten cold lately.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.920
Have Liangjin prepare a hand warmer for you every day.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.040
Second Brother,

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.640
if there's any news,

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.880
please let me know right away.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.120
Don't worry.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.920
I'll tell you as soon as I hear anything.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.240
Alright.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.880
Okay.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.280
I'm really useless.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.960
You all don't need to keep working.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.160
Go celebrate the New Year.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.680
Thank you, Madam.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.920
Thank you, Master.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.120
Happy New Year!

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.160
Go on, everyone.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:22.720
Go on, everyone.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.040
Thank you, Madam.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:23.720
Go, go.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.280
You all go too.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:24.520
Dad.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:24.680
It's New Year.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.040
Come on.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.520
Let's set off fireworks.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.240
Lan Zhi and I

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.120
wish you a happy New Year.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.960
Here, Dad.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.560
May you live as long as the southern pine.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.440
May everything go smoothly next year.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:33.920
Here's to you.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.200
Here, Dad.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.200
Good, good, I'll take your good wishes.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.400
Alright.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.320
Come, come.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:42.840
Thank you, Dad.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.960
And here's a red envelope.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.880
Thank you, Dad.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.360
This one's for Lan Zhi.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.040
These are for you.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.400
You handle the money, so you keep it.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.320
This one's for Wang'er.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.160
Thank you, Dad.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.520
Yu'er.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.640
Thank you, Dad.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.320
Big Brother.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.240
Where's the New Year's money for me and Yu'er?

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.720
What New Year's money?

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.320
You're too old for that now.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.080
Besides,

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.240
I don't have any money.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.200
Didn't the Ceremonial Office give you a share?

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.920
I remember Big Brother's share was one hundred.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.720
Look, these chicken feet are delicious.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.600
Hurry, have one, have one.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.880
Have one, have one, have one.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.400
I've only kept it warm for four hours.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.160
Yu'er,

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.400
aren't you going to do something about him?

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.600
Even you, the eldest, can't handle him.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.880
I'm just the third child.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.080
How could I have that ability?

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.920
Why do I feel like something's off with you?

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:40.880
Nothing's wrong with me.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.280
This year,

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.800
Yu'er is getting married.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.160
Second brother,

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.800
when will you

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.240
do something serious?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:50.920
You're right.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.280
I...

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.000
In this whole house,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.280
you're the only one without a wife.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.080
Isn't that right, Dad?

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.680
That's right.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.000
How did this end up about me?

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.080
Can we still eat in peace?

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.960
Good thing Chen Xiao is away on business this year.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.240
If you don't get engaged next year,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.440
you'll really be the only one left.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.400
Sister-in-law,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.760
you truly understand me.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.560
Here, my lady, a toast to you.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.160
With firecrackers, a year passes.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.240
Spring breezes bring warmth to the wine.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.040
I'll go set off some firecrackers.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.840
You all,

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.200
who's coming with me?

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.480
I'll go with second brother.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.080
Dad, we're heading out.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:30.720
Go ahead.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:31.880
We're not going.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.720
We'll stay with Dad.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.160
It's New Year's today.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.040
We should all be lively.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.040
And happy, too.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.840
You all go ahead.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.200
Dad said so.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.120
Let's hurry and go.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.080
Wait for us!

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.640
Yu'er!

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.640
Yu'er!

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.320
Brother Wang, you're here too!

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.600
Eat and drink well!

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.000
Abu!

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.840
Come on, Abu!

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.680
Come on, come on!

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:43.640
Brothers!

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.480
Cheers!

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.720
Alright, bottoms up!

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.280
No leaving till we're drunk!

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.440
Come!

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.880
I need to use the restroom.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.080
You all keep drinking.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.240
Hurry up!

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.240
Come on, come on!

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.080
Come on!

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.560
It's almost dawn.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.160
They're still not resting.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.760
The Wurong celebration

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.240
lasts until dawn the next day.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.440
Shut up.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.520
Brother Wang.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.160
Kill for me!

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.600
If the Wurong King dies,

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.640
no one will restrain Dayue.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.920
Ling'an's border will be devastated.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.120
No way.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:01.840
Brother Wang.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.280
Are there guards outside the court?

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.000
Yes.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.560
Go get soldiers.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.320
Then, Brother Wang,

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:05.800
with me here,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.720
he won't die.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.320
Let's go.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.680
Hurry, go!

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:23.720
Abu!

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.840
You traitor!

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.440
How dare you betray Wurong for Dayue!

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.880
This must be the antidote

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.160
for the little prince's poison.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:48.720
Search!

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.800
See if anyone's alive.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:50.560
Yes.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.640
I failed to judge people well.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.960
Sorry for your suffering, young master.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.880
You helped me this time,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.280
you're a benefactor to Wurong.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.520
I still don't know

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.520
how to address you, young master.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.560
My name is

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.280
Beicheng.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.240
Young Master Beicheng,

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.280
I've offended you before.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.560
Please don't take it to heart.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:14.960
It was my fault.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.480
The princess was deceived by traitors.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.920
Now the misunderstanding is cleared.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.840
I can return to Ling'an at ease.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.120
You're leaving?

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.320
I've been gone for days.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.800
My family must be worried.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.360
Just escort me to Ling'an's gate.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.960
The road back to Ling'an is dangerous.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.520
Why not stay a few more days?

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.720
Wait for spring, then return.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:39.920
It seems

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.760
the Wurong King won't let me go.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.800
If I insist on leaving now,

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.080
I'm afraid...

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.440
Then may I write a letter home?

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.240
Well...

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.360
Wurong and Dayue

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.760
have fought over water for centuries.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.040
Will you help me reclaim the water?

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.800
Wurong wants to monopolize the water.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.040
We've never wanted to keep it all.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.080
Water is a gift from heaven.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.240
Monopolizing it

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.880
will only anger the heavens.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.640
Water is the grassland's lifeblood.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.480
If we can't reclaim it,

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.280
other Wurong tribes

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.920
will suffer greatly.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.720
Didn't expect the Wurong King to be so just.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.560
Fighting for innocent herders.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.160
I must help with this.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.120
I'll do my utmost to help.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.280
It's always been survival of the fittest.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.480
Young Master Beicheng is skilled.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.280
And knows the art of war.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.480
Surely,

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.440
you understand my meaning.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.520
Take this chance to reclaim Dayue.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.240
Strengthen Wurong.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.480
That would be wonderful.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.720
Be my general in Wurong then.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.800
Wouldn't that be grand?

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.440
The Wurong King won't let me return.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.120
Nor write a letter home.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.840
He clearly has other plans.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.480
Looks like I need another plan.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.160
Father

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:18.800
Mother

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:19.840
Youyi

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.480
Lord Rui

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.000
Has my junior sister returned yet?

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.480
Not yet.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.760
But she wrote me a letter.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.440
She also bought many local specialties.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.320
She asked me to bring them for you.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.360
Why did Xiaoxiao suddenly leave the capital?

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.400
Mother

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.120
It's cold outside.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.160
You're not well, don't catch a chill.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.320
Let's talk inside.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.760
Yes, madam.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.480
Let's go in first.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:50.520
Let's go.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.040
Wanwan

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.640
Was there anything fun on New Year's Eve?

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.560
Tell me about it!

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.280
Everyone gathers at home on New Year's Eve.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.560
The streets are empty.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.120
There's really nothing interesting.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.160
If Your Highness wants to have fun,

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.480
wait for the Lantern Festival.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.760
That's when it's truly lively.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.360
I thought this year would be different.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.280
But I still have to wait for the festival.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.360
Why aren't my brother and mother here yet?

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.400
I'm already hungry.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.360
You...

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.200
As a princess,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.760
you should sit properly.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.360
Show some decorum.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.960
Mother

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.280
Brother

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.440
Miss Ming has entered the palace again.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.280
Your servant greets Your Majesty.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.080
Empress Dowager

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.040
Wishing peace and harmony in the new year.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.520
May this year surpass the last.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.280
Please, sit.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.400
Yes.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.160
You...

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.280
If you could visit me more often,

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.960
that would be the best.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.840
Yes, Wanwan.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.440
You should come to the palace more.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.680
Keep Mother company for me.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.760
Mother is happier seeing you

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.880
than she is seeing me.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.720
If you were as refined as Miss Ming,

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.480
I'd have much less to worry about.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.200
The princess is so cheerful.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.360
The Empress Dowager loves to make her smile.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.240
Wanwan speaks so pleasantly.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.760
Isn't that right, brother?

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.120
If Wanwan becomes the empress one day,

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.800
I will honor Mother.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.640
Let's eat.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.120
Wonderful! Mother was waiting for you to say that.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.440
I couldn't ask you at the table earlier.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.920
Since that day,

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.640
Chenxiao disappeared.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.320
Where did he go?

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.560
Could it be

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.480
that something happened to him?

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.080
Father

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.640
I can only tell you this.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.440
Please don't tell Mother.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.920
Alright.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.440
Go ahead.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.840
I can handle it.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.720
The Emperor and I

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.800
actually both know Chenxiao

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.080
is a man.
