Yu Xingchen

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.640
That night

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.320
What I said to you
on the bridge

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.240
Maybe it was
a bit inappropriate

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.040
Don't take it to heart

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.840
Get well soon

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.320
Good luck
on your exam

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.760
Thank you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.160
Good luck to you
on your exam too

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.200
What am I
trying to say

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.680
Thank you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.400
I feel like
I'm forgetting something

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.000
What is it
that I forgot

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.000
Today at 8 a.m.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.920
-2010 Academic Proficiency Test begins -Eat more, son

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.560
-About twelve thousand students in Minghe City -Eat well for energy

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.440
Entering the exam room

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.320
Taking the first Gaokao exam
this year

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.080
Don't be nervous
during the exam

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.360
Be careful

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.280
Why say so much

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.760
Too much talk
makes kids nervous

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.360
Xingchen, eat all of this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.200
Eat until you're full

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.360
Mom

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.040
I'm done eating

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.880
I'm heading out

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.000
Did you pack everything

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.280
Don't forget
your exam admission ticket

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.400
If you lose your exam ticket
before entering

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.760
Don't be careless

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.560
Even if I'm careless,
it'll be fine

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.400
Zhang Jie

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.960
Morning

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.000
Morning

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.440
Let's go

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.080
Mom, Dad

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm leaving now

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.480
That's the lowest price, bro

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.840
Two hundred yuan,
what more do you want

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.720
Forget it

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.640
Fine, one hundred it is

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.960
You win

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.800
Selling such a small bouquet
for one hundred

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.680
That's too much

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.000
Mind your own business

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.200
I'm not selling to you

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.800
Who says it's not her business

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.000
Here

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.920
This is for me

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.800
They said today is exam day

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.160
You're taking the exam too

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.720
My mom said

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.640
Flowers bring good luck

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.280
Not thinking straight,
still copying others giving flowers

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.280
Really a toad
lusting after a swan

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.080
Alright

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.320
I'll accept it

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.960
Thank you for the flowers

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.920
If you insist on selling for one hundred

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.560
I'll have to get someone
to judge

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.440
Then how much do you want

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.440
I'm about to take my exam

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.440
You can't bring flowers inside

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.400
Wait until I finish the exam

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.560
Then give me the flowers

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.360
Is that okay

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.120
I want to see the footage
from the day of the incident

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.840
Is that possible

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.960
What did I forget

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.000
Come on, enter in order

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.960
Form a line

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.640
Get your exam ticket ready

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.680
Get your exam tickets ready

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.280
Enter in order

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.160
Get your exam ticket ready

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.280
Form a line

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.200
Come on, enter in order

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.360
Form a line

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.360
Get your exam ticket ready

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.360
What's wrong

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.120
I can't find
my exam ticket

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.240
Did you leave it at home

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.520
I must've dropped it
on the way

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.840
What should I do

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.560
Good luck

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.720
Good luck, son

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.720
You'll be fine

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.680
Like this

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.040
Check again carefully

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.760
We'll report your situation now

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.440
Yu Xingchen

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.040
Yu Xingchen,
what should I do now

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.960
I can't find my exam ticket
anywhere

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.960
What should I do

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.360
Don't worry

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.720
I'm running out of time

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.760
What should I do

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.520
Are you sure
you brought your exam ticket

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.800
I'm sure

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.360
When you left home

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.480
Which route did you take

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.760
After I left home

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.680
I took Bus Route 82

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.880
After getting off,
I went straight to school

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.800
Alright, don't worry

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.560
I'll help you look for it

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.960
Yu Xingchen,
the exam is starting soon

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.880
There's still time

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.800
Wait here for me

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.560
Can you stop following me

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.080
Come on, I'll take you home first

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.440
I said it's fine

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.600
This scene feels familiar

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.360
Can you stop following me

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.400
Yu Xingchen

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.080
Hurry up too

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.960
We're almost late

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.040
Hurry, run for me

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.960
So absent-minded

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.240
You need to be alert today

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.880
I said it's fine

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.480
In your situation now

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.560
You should take care
of yourself first

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.400
You're alone now

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.320
If you catch a cold

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.880
Who will take care of you

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.920
Don't worry

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.480
I'm not going anywhere

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240
I'll wait here for you

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.440
I won't leave you
with this person

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.600
I'll take you away

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.560
I'll stand up for her
on behalf of her parents

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.360
Is that okay

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.240
Yu Xingchen

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.240
Are you alright

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.800
I want to get into
the same university as Yu Xingchen

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.400
Study together

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.040
I'll major in education

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.200
You can study
whatever you want

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.440
Sorry about that.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.560
I didn't know my own strength.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.040
I just remembered.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.080
I'm not from here.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.880
I am.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.560
Thanks.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.040
You're welcome.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.360
Did I hit you so hard you got confused?

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.760
You ran the wrong way.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.800
The school is this way.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.920
Darn it, darn it.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.840
I'll head off now.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.080
Don't be late.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.720
By the second exam,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.840
it was finally found and brought over.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.200
Someone handed it to the officer.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.560
The officer brought it here.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.800
But that person didn't leave a name.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.560
The class monitor said

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.200
someone gave Su Ruo's exam admission ticket
to the officer.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.240
And the officer delivered it to the exam room.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.080
It was during the second exam.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.120
There wasn't much time between the two.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.080
Did you see this exam admission ticket?

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.320
So when Su Ruo lost her ticket,

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.120
it must've been right after the first exam.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.360
It was found quickly.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.480
Since it wasn't on the road,

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.000
someone might've already found it.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.400
Who picked it up?

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.640
Finding something as important as an exam ticket,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.600
the officer would surely record the name.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.520
Unless this person

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.000
couldn't communicate at all.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.320
Did you see Su Ruo's exam ticket?

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.320
She went to school.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.840
I'm waiting here for her to come back.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200
To give her flowers.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.400
Su Ruo.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.880
You just saw her.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.040
Yeah.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.680
But I have something urgent to do now.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.640
She hasn't come back yet.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.560
I can't leave.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.720
What's so urgent you need to do?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.960
I need to find the officer.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.240
Look.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.040
Her photo is on this.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.880
It must be important to her.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.800
Give it to me.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.000
Okay.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.280
Yu Xingchen, come back quickly.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.720
It's fine if you can't find it.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.720
Just make sure you aren't late.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.680
Su Ruo.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.760
How did you manage this?

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.160
You even lost your exam ticket.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.120
Sorry.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.520
What should we do now?

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.400
Teacher, is there any way you can help?

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.440
She really is my student.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.440
I can vouch for her.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.120
I'll get her a new ticket later.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.200
But there's nothing we can do.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.080
Well...

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.160
Even if we let her in here,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.400
she can't enter the exam room without her ticket.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.800
We've already called the officer.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.160
Everyone's searching for it.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.080
Yes, Teacher Jiang.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.680
All our teachers are looking for it.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.320
Don't worry.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.880
How can I not worry?

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.600
It's already been ten minutes.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:30.960
Teacher Jiang.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.000
I'm not the most important right now.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.080
It's Yu Xingchen.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.400
He's helping me look for the ticket.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.480
He hasn't come back yet.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:37.960
What?

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.200
Su Ruo.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.680
You two, stop dawdling.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.800
Go in quickly.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.480
Teacher Jiang.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.200
We're going in now.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.560
Su Ruo.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.080
I'm in Exam Room 3.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.400
Your Exam Room 7 is over there.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.640
After your exam,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.920
wait for me at the school gate.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.920
I have something to tell you.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.280
I have something to tell you too.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.840
Sorry, I'm late.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.280
Looks like Yu Xingchen is all you think about.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.360
Don't write Yu Xingchen's name on your exam.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.840
Darn it, I have no idea about this.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.520
Good thing it's Chinese.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.320
Forget it.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.200
I'll start with the essay.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.200
If you could go back in time,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.040
what would you say to your past self?

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.440
Seeing you again

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.520
feels like after so many years,

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.480
I'm taking the Gaokao all over again.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.480
So much to say,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.440
but I just want to tell you a few things.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.400
You need to have enough confidence.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.920
Not because you'll be so successful someday,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.360
like running a big company

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.640
or becoming a celebrity,

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.960
but you should be brave.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.000
Even if the love letter you send

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.040
doesn't work out,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.160
you should still face challenges head-on.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
Because your talent stands out.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.080
You should care for others,

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.920
even if no one can put a price on your kindness.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.160
You should stay true to yourself,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.920
even if

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.440
the world crushes you to pieces.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.880
Learn to make peace with the world,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.960
even if it never treats you peacefully.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.800
You also need to learn responsibility,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:39.520
even if it feels suffocating.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.880
Even if it feels suffocating.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.920
Everyone from the past

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.400
and everyone in the future

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.120
faces all kinds of problems.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.200
But everyone

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.640
in their own way

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.640
stands tall.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.160
Unshaken.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.720
They all respond

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.200
to the world in their own way.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.280
And in the long river of life,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.200
they leave a mark with resilience.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.400
That's right.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.320
You and I are not alone.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.920
We don't only have each other.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.160
You, right now,

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.520
are chasing a glimmer of the future,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.600
fighting through the words of the Gaokao exam.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.720
This is truly a tough thing.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.480
But trust me,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.400
it's not as hard as life will be.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.520
So,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.680
keep going.
