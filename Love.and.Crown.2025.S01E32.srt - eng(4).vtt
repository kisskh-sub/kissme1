there's no turning back for us now.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:03.180
[Changhe Gate]

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:10.940
Sir.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:12.940
Sir,

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.770
how did the Prince of Yuzhang handle

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.970
those resignation memorials?

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.420
He approved them all.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:19.770
What is he trying to do?

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.250
He's going to ruin the realm.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:24.050
- What are we to do? - Go back and tell the Old Madam

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.940
to gather all the family

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.660
and leave the Capital at once.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.900
Sir, what about you?

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.050
There's one last thing I must do.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.770
Once it's done,

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.450
I'll catch up with you.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:38.210
Understood.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:48.140
With His Majesty's fate uncertain,

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.340
the court has fallen into chaos.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.620
The Prince of Yuzhang serves as Regent,

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.250
yet ignores state affairs.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.210
[Changhe Gate]
The Imperial Preceptor beside him

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.420
harbors wolfish ambition.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.690
Now in this court,

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:04.940
those above

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.600
cannot reach the imperial ear,

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:08.490
and those below

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.340
cannot aid the common folk.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:14.380
Villains hold sway,

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:20.210
a disgrace to Great Qi!

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.580
If this goes on,

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:29.580
the officials' hearts will scatter,

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.770
and Heaven itself

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:36.900
will show ill omen!

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.140
Why don't we

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.100
just throw Li Chengtian into the prison?

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.100
Let's see how tough this old bone really is.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.180
If I do that now,

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.820
I'd only grant him the name of a loyal minister.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:07.490
By now, every courtier who can be threatened or bought

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:08.940
is already under my command.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.250
Those who still refuse to yield

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.420
also serve my purposes

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.970
thanks to Lingbi Sect's Heartbane.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.100
Only a few stubborn old bones are left.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.860
They are a deadly hidden threat.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:31.690
Why not ask the Saintess to use the Heartbane on him as well?

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.940
That pack of vermin is foul and stubborn,

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.380
utterly unafraid of death!

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.730
Even if I poison him,

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.490
he'll most likely kill himself to prove his loyalty.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.530
As for Li Chengtian,

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.380
if he must die,

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:00.580
I'll see that his death serves my ends.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.860
[Merciful Salvation]

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.260
On guard!

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.740
- Mr. Li! - Mr. Li!

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.380
- Mr. Li! - Mr. Li!

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:50.700
Mr. Li!

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.530
Mr. Li!

[One with Heaven and Earth]

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.700
We respectfully greet the Saintess!

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.220
Reporting to the Saintess,

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.050
several of our branches have been destroyed recently.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.530
They say...

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:24.260
They say...

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.380
Say what?

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:28.260
They say the Ghost King has appeared,

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:29.420
and heaven and earth are as one.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.010
And the Ghost King even beat us to it,

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.490
completing the Nanrong Palace mission

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:35.050
and killing Li Chengtian.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.490
How could a new Ghost King appear?

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.450
Does he have the Moon-Eclipse on him?

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.940
Yes.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.650
All those slain by him

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:45.380
bear ghost markings.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.650
Only one who holds the Moon-Eclipse

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.700
can do this.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.570
The Ghost King's return

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.420
is the glory of Lingbi Sect!

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.100
[Seven days earlier]

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.860
Now the Saintess is using Du Tingxin's hand

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.290
to endanger the whole court,

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.650
even all of Great Qi.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.700
I've thought it through carefully.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.050
I stand in the light,

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:33.410
and the Saintess hides in the dark.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.300
If we are to save everyone's lives,

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:37.840
we must stage my death.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.080
Your Majesty,

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.800
your body is already spent.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.400
You can't take much more.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:45.400
How can you possibly stand against them?

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.330
The Moon-Eclipse is the Ghost King's token

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.970
because it is both medicine and poison.

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:56.250
It can heal wounds and save lives,

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.410
and even strengthen one's inner power.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.630
But once it's used, there is no turning back.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.580
It'll consume your essence and shorten your life.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.260
When the poison seeps into your bones,

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.390
it will destroy you.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:54.260
He is inside.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:11.530
Your Majesty has suffered.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:13.970
I'm fine.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:17.050
You truly have not betrayed my trust.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.050
I've followed Your Majesty for so many years.

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:25.010
I never believed you would harm Princess Ying,

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.860
nor that you would seek your own death.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.570
So your leap from Phoenix Terrace

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.300
must have been your plan to escape.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.130
As soon as Eunuch Feng sent word,

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.170
I immediately activated the Xiaoxing secret guards

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:36.530
and learned you were here.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.050
Commander Li,

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:48.130
head to the meeting spot outside the Capital now,

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:49.970
activate the Xiaoxing secret guards,

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.900
locate His Majesty,

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.970
and await his command.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.570
Take care.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:15.700
How are things at court?

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.970
Everything is just as you predicted.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.650
Although everyone believes

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.820
you couldn't have survived in the Qining River,

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.420
the upright elder ministers

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:23.570
still invoked the ancestral rules

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.010
to block the Prince of Yuzhang from taking the throne.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.570
Even the Imperial Preceptor can do nothing about it.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.010
So,

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.820
they're focusing all their efforts

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.420
on searching for my body.

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.780
Good.

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:34.490
Next,

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.900
I'll use my identity as the Ghost King to lure the Saintess out.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:38.570
Your Majesty...

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.810
Becoming the Ghost King with the Moon-Eclipse

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.940
is a choice I made long ago.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.860
You've given too much for Great Qi.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.340
I am answerable to the world,

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.170
and to every subject of Great Qi.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.450
It's only Cangcang I've failed.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.610
How is Cangcang?

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.610
The Empress is safe and sound.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.570
I never imagined

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:00.410
that meeting Cangcang,

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.930
killing Li Lu,

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.490
and obtaining the Moon-Eclipse

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.940
were all fated from the start.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.780
Whatever you plan to do,

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:13.900
I'll surely advance and retreat with you.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.050
Cangcang,

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.340
her roots run deep in the palace.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.120
If I move against her,

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.120
it'll surely trigger a mad backlash.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.170
Only by getting you safely away

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.520
can I stake everything on one last move.

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:31.280
I'm sorry.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:32.490
Bai!

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.490
Are you there?

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.700
Don't worry.

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.610
I believe in you.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.170
I'll wait for you to come back.

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:47.420
Thanks for looking after me, sir.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:49.490
I'll repay your kindness someday.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.860
Let's go.

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.220
Are those wearing ghost masks from Lingbi Sect?

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.050
They are.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:33.170
I hear Lingbi Sect is no small thing these days.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.530
They're recruiting men,

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:35.940
growing stronger and stronger.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.300
But hasn't Lingbi Sect

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.300
been suppressed by the court for over a year?

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.420
And they still dare to swagger around like this?

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.940
Word is the Lingbi Saintess

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.340
has returned from the far south,

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.490
and even latched onto the court.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.170
Truly chaotic times.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.490
The court itself is a mess.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:53.300
The Emperor and Empress are both ill.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.530
A prince is acting as Regent.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:57.650
Could she be the Lingbi Saintess?

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.940
Hush.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.050
Come on, have some tea.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.340
My father planted spies in the palace.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.220
How many are left?

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:09.530
I don't know the exact number.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.740
Grand Tutor Ling laid many hidden pieces,

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:13.090
and even I don't know them all.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.050
Then how am I supposed to find them?

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.340
Me?

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:17.970
Right.

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:19.010
The key lies with you.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.450
What do you mean?

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.570
Before Grand Tutor Ling was killed at Fayun Temple,

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.860
he secretly summoned us.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.860
If anything happened to him,

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.820
Fayun Temple would sound the bell as a warning,

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.010
and we were all to follow your lead.
