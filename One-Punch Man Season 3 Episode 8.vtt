Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:33.220 --> 00:36.680
Please read the transmitter
operation manual thoroughly.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.940
The map I made is included.

00:40.560 --> 00:44.980
In emergencies we can communicate,
but do not count on being rescued.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.400
The underground is deep and vast

00:47.530 --> 00:50.490
so always keep track of
your current location.

00:50.990 --> 00:53.620
Losing your way in enemy territory
can be fatal.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.410
Please be careful.

00:56.290 --> 01:00.710
Hey. You're that super-fast hero,
Flashy Flash, right?

01:01.120 --> 01:02.120
Give me the boy.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.920
We've been waitin' for you.

01:04.250 --> 01:07.920
We already knew you were
coming in through this route.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.340
You boast about your speed

01:10.380 --> 01:13.720
but let's see if it works
in this narrow corridor.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.020
I've never bragged about my speed.

01:21.020 --> 01:23.730
That's the kind of thing
a side character would do.

01:24.020 --> 01:26.690
Though I do get told
I finish things quickly.

02:57.030 --> 03:00.870
{\an8}NINJA TALE

03:12.340 --> 03:13.460
Impressive.

03:14.630 --> 03:15.590
Flashy...

03:18.840 --> 03:19.930
Well done.

03:20.390 --> 03:22.100
That's what makes you worth killing.

03:22.260 --> 03:24.430
Don't tell me that
was your top speed?

03:24.770 --> 03:27.900
You're the one responsible
for the Final 44 Incident.

03:28.020 --> 03:29.900
Flashy Flash.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.440
Oh, I see...

03:40.030 --> 03:41.910
So you were after me this whole time?

03:42.120 --> 03:43.620
Hmph. We finally meet.

03:43.660 --> 03:44.910
I’ve been waiting for this.

03:45.370 --> 03:46.210
<i>This guy...</i>

03:46.830 --> 03:47.790
Wind Blade Kick!

03:50.790 --> 03:52.130
Flame Blade Kick!

03:55.590 --> 03:56.420
<i>Steel wire...!</i>

03:59.680 --> 04:00.930
<i>So close!</i>

04:01.220 --> 04:04.010
I was this close to chopping you up
into little scraps of meat.

04:04.270 --> 04:08.100
I never expected you
to charge in alone like that.

04:08.230 --> 04:10.150
You must be pretty confident.

04:10.190 --> 04:12.230
Thanks to that,
things just got a lot easier for us.

04:20.610 --> 04:21.779
Enough of the chit-chat.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.740
<i>Now, run for your life.</i>

04:24.030 --> 04:28.120
<i>Like an insect chased by wind and flame,</i>
<i>flying straight into the spider's web.</i>

04:28.330 --> 04:31.920
<i>You'll be shred into pieces</i>
<i>by your own speed!</i>

04:39.590 --> 04:41.180
He cut away the walls.

04:41.260 --> 04:42.850
So, you're from the village, huh?

04:42.930 --> 04:46.180
And you joined the monsters
to take me down?

04:46.390 --> 04:48.020
Hmph. It's too cramped here.

04:48.850 --> 04:50.140
Let's move to another spot.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.620
Storm Blade Kick!

05:21.930 --> 05:23.590
Not a bad spot, huh?

05:23.890 --> 05:26.720
We took it by force
from the monsters.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.180
We can fight all we want here.

05:29.480 --> 05:30.730
And as hard as we want.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.480
The ones who will slay you are...

05:33.520 --> 05:35.440
From the Golden 37!

05:35.860 --> 05:37.570
Tempest Wind!

05:36.230 --> 05:37.980
{\an8}THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
TEMPEST WIND

05:39.940 --> 05:41.400
And Hellfire Flame!

05:40.440 --> 05:41.780
{\an8}THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
HELLFIRE FLAME

06:06.470 --> 06:07.680
Who hired you?

06:07.810 --> 06:09.770
After I finish off
the Monster Association

06:09.770 --> 06:12.520
I'll go pay a visit
to your employer.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.450
Our employer?

06:31.870 --> 06:36.540
What if I told you it's Skilfish
the King of Human Trafficking...

06:37.130 --> 06:40.130
Do you really expect to take on

06:40.210 --> 06:43.010
the army of his underworld
organization by yourself?

06:43.670 --> 06:45.630
- No.
- How come?

06:45.800 --> 06:50.220
Because I already killed him.
He kept sending assassins after me.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.730
What about Drug Shogun Heraud?

06:53.890 --> 06:55.270
Killed him too.

06:55.310 --> 06:57.230
Heart Collector Buligula?

06:57.270 --> 06:58.110
Finished him.

06:58.150 --> 06:59.650
Freak Phantom Thief Chimagusa?

06:59.690 --> 07:00.520
I took him out.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.530
Indomitable Bandit Captain Jamastorm?

07:02.530 --> 07:04.150
Oh yeah, I almost forgot about him.

07:04.780 --> 07:07.740
Assassination Alliance High Command?

07:07.910 --> 07:09.700
They're all at
the bottom of the ocean.

07:10.370 --> 07:13.870
I don't go around telling people,
so no one knows

07:14.000 --> 07:17.040
but I killed everyone who
came after me.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.290
Are you done with
all the loaded questions?

07:20.540 --> 07:24.720
So, who's really pulling
the strings behind the scenes?

07:25.010 --> 07:30.720
Those were the people we were
going to kill after finishing you off.

07:30.760 --> 07:34.930
But you've spared us the trouble.
So we're grateful.

07:35.230 --> 07:37.730
Thank you.
But you must now die!

07:40.020 --> 07:41.150
Compared to the heroes

07:41.150 --> 07:43.780
the top fighters from the village are
far more troublesome.

07:45.820 --> 07:47.650
Not all ninjas are from the village.

07:47.780 --> 07:50.030
But they're nothing compared
to ninjas from the village.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.910
Our generation from the village,
the Golden 37

07:52.910 --> 07:54.580
were hailed
as the strongest in history.

07:54.660 --> 07:56.870
We're the top two
of that generation.

07:56.870 --> 07:58.370
Let's see how long you'll last

07:58.420 --> 08:00.380
former number one
of the 44th generation!

08:13.310 --> 08:14.180
Not bad.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.020
Was that your top speed?

08:16.140 --> 08:17.640
Stop holding back.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.650
Why don't you just
unleash it already?

08:20.150 --> 08:22.060
That monster power of yours.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.270
Hmph. So you knew.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.690
I had a strange feeling
when we first fought

08:27.690 --> 08:30.820
but I knew for sure when you
wanted to move the fight elsewhere.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.830
You only recently became monsters

08:33.830 --> 08:36.580
so you're not used
to your top speeds yet.

08:36.870 --> 08:39.580
So you lured me into
this open space.

08:39.750 --> 08:43.250
Well, well. So you knew,
and still took the bait?

08:43.419 --> 08:46.760
You're one cocky bastard.
Show some respect to your seniors!

08:47.050 --> 08:50.220
Right back at you.
I'll teach you lowlifes a lesson.

08:50.340 --> 08:54.390
Turning into monsters doesn't
mean you can surpass me.

08:54.510 --> 08:57.930
Those words...
you can't take them back now.

08:54.890 --> 08:57.930
{\an8}THREAT LEVEL: DRAGON
HELLFIRE FLAME/TEMPEST WIND

08:58.310 --> 09:00.850
From here on, don't look away.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.870
Fireburst Scatterflash Slash.

09:22.790 --> 09:25.130
<i>He withstood my monster swordplay?</i>

09:25.210 --> 09:26.590
<i>Or was it just luck? No...</i>

09:28.920 --> 09:30.050
Heavy Flash Slash.

09:33.930 --> 09:35.390
Your aim was to destroy
my weapon?!

09:35.510 --> 09:37.930
Too slow. Your brain can’t keep up,
you're useless.

09:41.140 --> 09:44.230
I can see why they say
he's a genius, just like us.

09:44.480 --> 09:48.940
In terms of technical precision,
Flash might have the edge.

09:49.230 --> 09:53.160
He shows no sign of having
a disadvantage in speed or power.

09:53.450 --> 09:57.280
No monsters other than us
would stand a chance against him...

09:57.280 --> 09:59.200
Still think you outclass me?

09:59.330 --> 10:00.660
You don't.

10:02.410 --> 10:05.710
Tempest Wind, Hellfire Flame...

10:05.710 --> 10:08.420
I know your moves inside and out.

10:09.340 --> 10:13.260
After all, I've trained harder
than anyone.

10:13.720 --> 10:17.550
The more skilled a fighter is, the less
they deviate from the fundamentals.

10:17.890 --> 10:19.260
No matter how fast the attack

10:19.350 --> 10:22.810
if you know the fundamentals,
you can deal with it easily.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.230
Hmph. All right.

10:26.650 --> 10:28.110
That's enough...right?

10:28.230 --> 10:31.820
Yeah, that's enough.
I'm done fighting as a ninja.

10:32.070 --> 10:33.950
No more technique or weapons.

10:34.070 --> 10:36.370
We'll kill you as monsters.

10:36.490 --> 10:39.990
That will be the most brutal
and violent way.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.910
What you are about
to witness will simply be...

10:43.040 --> 10:47.880
Both of us pulverizing a weakling
with our overwhelming speed.

10:48.130 --> 10:52.010
You forced us to abandon
our last shred of pride as ninjas.

10:52.010 --> 10:56.220
Out of respect, we'll unleash
our maximum speed and

10:56.260 --> 10:58.970
attack you relentlessly
until you're dead.

10:59.220 --> 11:02.890
Learn what separates
humans from monsters, and die.

11:03.060 --> 11:05.730
Farewell. Flashy Flash.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.830
You think you can get away
from me now?

11:26.960 --> 11:29.000
Do not disappoint me.

11:52.150 --> 11:53.440
Flashy Kick!

11:56.280 --> 11:58.030
<i>This is bad, he's closing in.</i>

11:58.200 --> 12:00.120
<i>We need to get</i>
<i>our footing back quickly.</i>

12:03.700 --> 12:04.620
Absolute technique.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.960
Flashy Slash.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.720
Damn it. How irritating.

12:23.180 --> 12:26.730
He had that secret technique all along,
and didn't use it until now.

12:27.390 --> 12:31.060
I was just waiting for the right moment
to take you both down.

12:31.350 --> 12:36.530
If even one of you escaped,
it would've been troublesome later.

12:40.570 --> 12:42.240
None of the other Class-S heroes

12:42.240 --> 12:46.160
would've been able to keep up
with your speed.

12:46.450 --> 12:51.540
Your best move was simply
not to fight me at all.

12:51.920 --> 12:55.050
If only my opponent weren't you...

12:56.510 --> 12:58.630
You really get under my skin.

12:59.010 --> 13:01.430
Assassins live in the shadows.

13:01.550 --> 13:05.220
We're never treated as people.
Only used and discarded.

13:06.180 --> 13:11.190
We just wanted to be the ones
in control...to rule for once.

13:12.020 --> 13:13.520
To gain power...

13:13.650 --> 13:16.270
we tried everything we could think of...

13:16.780 --> 13:18.570
Flashy Flash...

13:19.030 --> 13:22.320
What was it that we lacked?

13:39.380 --> 13:41.170
Not enough training.

13:53.810 --> 13:55.150
Where am I?

13:55.440 --> 13:57.610
I should check my current position.

13:57.690 --> 13:58.820
{\an8}RUMMAGING

13:59.900 --> 14:00.940
{\an8}SPEEDY

14:03.660 --> 14:04.910
{\an8}WHOOSH

14:05.700 --> 14:09.330
The one moving around at
high speed must have been Flash.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.080
But then he stopped.
Is his transmitter broken?

14:13.830 --> 14:16.210
<i>There's no unusual movements</i>
<i>from the others.</i>

14:17.040 --> 14:19.880
<i>But even if anything happens,</i>
<i>they can handle it.</i>

14:20.170 --> 14:21.420
<i>And if they're truly in danger,</i>

14:21.420 --> 14:23.680
<i>I'm sure they'll send</i>
<i>a distress signal.</i>

14:24.890 --> 14:27.720
<i>They're not the ones</i>
<i>I'm worried about.</i>

14:28.260 --> 14:30.180
<i>If we can somehow</i>
<i>rescue the hostage</i>

14:30.220 --> 14:34.100
<i>the mental strain of this battle</i>
<i>will be greatly reduced.</i>

14:35.270 --> 14:38.900
<i>I need to do what I can</i>
<i>so they can go all out.</i>

14:39.400 --> 14:42.820
<i>I kept quiet to avoid stirring things up,</i>
<i>but I have some intel.</i>

14:46.070 --> 14:47.370
{\an8}MINI OCTO-TANK NO. 8

14:48.410 --> 14:49.240
<i>I'm close!</i>

14:54.040 --> 14:55.000
<i>Unbelievable...</i>

14:55.790 --> 14:59.130
<i>Knight did extreme durability testing,</i>
<i>but he's in this state.</i>

14:59.630 --> 15:02.550
<i>Apparently Monster King Orochi</i>
<i>did this to him.</i>

15:02.670 --> 15:05.470
<i>What kind of attack</i>
<i>destroyed him to this extent?</i>

15:05.840 --> 15:07.760
<i>Oh god, I hope I never run into him.</i>

15:09.300 --> 15:13.890
<i>Since he won't tell me, I'll just</i>
<i>extract the data from the robot.</i>

15:14.810 --> 15:16.310
Any data will do.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.520
As long as there's a clue that'll
lead me to the hostage's location.

15:21.230 --> 15:25.110
There's evidence someone
tried to reassemble it.

15:25.740 --> 15:30.740
Some parts show no damage at all
and are neatly disassembled.

15:30.910 --> 15:34.200
Do they have an expert
in this field?

15:34.580 --> 15:38.880
If the monsters use our own technology
against us, we're in serious trouble.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.590
Ugh, another headache...

15:42.500 --> 15:44.760
I found it!! This is...

15:45.420 --> 15:50.300
<i>The radar already mapped the</i>
<i>correct route to the hostage's location!</i>

15:50.850 --> 15:54.270
<i>He knew this the whole time,</i>
<i>but still refused to cooperate...</i>

15:54.560 --> 15:57.890
<i>Oh well,</i>
<i>getting angry won't help now.</i>

15:58.940 --> 16:02.690
<i>We finally found the right lead.</i>
<i>We gotta stay positive!</i>

16:03.270 --> 16:05.110
<i>I know the hostage's location.</i>

16:05.490 --> 16:09.700
<i>Taking steady, small steps is</i>
<i>the shortcut to success.</i>

16:10.370 --> 16:12.620
<i>You can't think straight</i>
<i>when you're irritated.</i>

16:12.780 --> 16:15.410
<i>I'm having some sugar</i>
<i>to give my brain a break.</i>

16:18.790 --> 16:20.630
Did you make that?

16:20.750 --> 16:22.380
What a childish design.

16:22.630 --> 16:25.670
I bet you came here to
have fun, didn't you?

16:26.300 --> 16:28.840
It must be nice being a kid
and having no worries.

16:29.260 --> 16:32.850
But I show no mercy,
even to children.

16:34.470 --> 16:35.560
Are you one of the leaders?

16:36.140 --> 16:39.100
I'm what you'd call
a middle manager.

16:39.560 --> 16:43.020
Not exactly in the leadership,
but still respected by those around me.

16:43.110 --> 16:45.570
In a way, even more capable
than some of the bosses.

16:46.740 --> 16:51.280
Got it? Organizations have
all kinds of constraints.

16:51.610 --> 16:56.490
That's probably a tough concept
for a kid who just idolizes heroes.

16:57.080 --> 17:02.000
A clever kid gets promoted
to Class-S and becomes famous

17:02.040 --> 17:03.630
then gets spoiled rotten.

17:03.750 --> 17:08.010
Now his arrogance will be
his end. How tragic.

17:08.920 --> 17:12.720
You shouldn't have taken the praise
from adults too seriously.

17:14.220 --> 17:17.180
I only trust myself.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.890
This Monster Association is
just a stepping stone.

17:21.270 --> 17:25.069
Eventually, I'll take the title
of king from Orochi.

17:25.819 --> 17:32.610
{\an8}THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
PHOENIX MAN

17:25.819 --> 17:27.730
I'm Phoenix Man.

17:28.190 --> 17:29.940
I couldn't take off this bird costume

17:29.990 --> 17:32.610
and before I knew it,
I'd become a monster.

17:32.950 --> 17:35.280
Child Emperor...
You are a victim of the times.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.830
This is where you die.

17:36.950 --> 17:39.660
I'll give you an instant death
so you won't suffer.

17:39.750 --> 17:40.910
Beak Attack!

17:42.500 --> 17:46.540
While you were talking,
I fired out wires and set this up.

17:47.170 --> 17:52.340
This thin transparent film
is resistant to sudden impact.

17:53.220 --> 17:55.350
You can roll it up into a tube
and carry it around.

17:55.470 --> 17:57.600
You can even wrap candy with it.
Handy, isn't it?

17:58.770 --> 18:00.520
I'll name it "Invisible Wall."

18:00.930 --> 18:04.350
Too bland?
Maybe "Irritating Shield" is better.

18:05.110 --> 18:07.770
I thought I could have a
decent conversation with you.

18:07.860 --> 18:11.400
I considered taking you alive
and using you as my guide...

18:11.820 --> 18:13.860
But right now,
I'm in a bad mood.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.500
Ambition is fine,
but if you were truly talented

18:23.500 --> 18:26.210
you wouldn't have joined
the Monster Association.

18:27.630 --> 18:29.340
I guess the same goes for me.

18:29.630 --> 18:32.170
Thanks.
I feel a bit calmer now.

18:43.230 --> 18:44.600
Hey, shut up.

18:44.690 --> 18:45.520
What's the problem?

18:45.600 --> 18:47.150
The kid's making a fuss.

18:47.270 --> 18:49.690
What a pain in the butt.
Should we just eat him?

18:49.860 --> 18:52.740
The heroes have already broken in.

18:52.860 --> 18:55.410
Who cares about the well-being
of the hostages?

18:55.530 --> 18:56.360
I like that.

18:56.820 --> 18:58.830
Hm? What's this?

18:59.280 --> 19:00.830
- Huh?
- Huh?

19:00.950 --> 19:02.000
- Huh?
- Oh.

19:02.290 --> 19:03.710
Crap! Don't breathe it in!

19:11.460 --> 19:12.840
<i>- Waganma?</i>
- Huh?

19:14.260 --> 19:16.630
<i>I'm here to rescue you.</i>
<i>Come on, let's get outta here.</i>

19:19.140 --> 19:20.470
Hedro Press!

19:21.140 --> 19:23.850
{\an8}THREAT LEVEL: TIGER
HEDRO-JELLYFISH

19:25.810 --> 19:28.100
So some monsters
aren’t affected by poison gas?

19:35.280 --> 19:37.570
Maybe you're not as tough
as I thought?

19:37.780 --> 19:39.320
<i>Even cutting has no effect.</i>

19:41.120 --> 19:43.040
Aaargh...

19:43.160 --> 19:44.540
Just kidding!

19:44.660 --> 19:47.960
I'm telling you, cutting or
stabbing won't do a thing.

19:49.170 --> 19:51.960
I see you don't have
a way to kill me.

19:52.130 --> 19:53.840
My luck has finally turned!

19:53.920 --> 19:56.930
Who would've thought taking a
Class-S hero's head would be this easy?

19:59.720 --> 20:00.600
What the...?

20:00.760 --> 20:01.720
<i>It's fuel oil.</i>

20:05.770 --> 20:07.480
<i>That reeks.</i>
<i>Let's get outta here.</i>

20:07.560 --> 20:08.440
O-Okay.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.490
You can take off the Ribbit Mask now.

20:16.610 --> 20:17.610
How do you feel?

20:19.360 --> 20:21.320
Uh...I'm starving.

20:22.990 --> 20:25.080
You're the Class-S hero,
Child Emperor, right?

20:25.200 --> 20:26.960
What took you so long? Geez!

20:27.870 --> 20:29.290
Oops, sorry, sorry.

20:29.960 --> 20:30.790
Get behind me.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.500
- Huh?
- There's still something out there.

20:34.380 --> 20:36.760
I'll take it out with my
remote-control tank, then we move.

20:37.380 --> 20:38.630
That looks fun.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.890
You're a hero.

20:49.230 --> 20:52.400
Spare me your name.
I'll dispose of you right away.

20:53.690 --> 20:55.650
<i>A machine?!</i>
<i>In that case...</i>

21:01.160 --> 21:03.780
A mechanical opponent neutralizer.
Bug Ba-Zapper!

21:07.370 --> 21:09.580
Contains them in a high-voltage cage

21:09.660 --> 21:11.790
then overloads them with signals
to shut them down.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.460
Nice! I wanna take that robot home.

21:18.260 --> 21:19.130
What?

21:19.970 --> 21:21.010
<i>He's tough!</i>

21:21.470 --> 21:22.720
Waganma, stay back!

21:23.510 --> 21:26.680
Damn it. I'm burning through items fast,
but it can't be helped.

21:26.970 --> 21:27.890
Come out!

21:30.020 --> 21:31.690
Faithful Servants Underdog Men!

21:31.980 --> 21:34.360
No. 23. No. 24. No. 25!!

21:34.650 --> 21:35.520
Combine!

21:40.530 --> 21:42.320
Mad Underdog Cerberus!

21:42.740 --> 21:44.030
That looks fierce.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.330
Awesome! It's a robot fight.

21:46.410 --> 21:47.660
Uh, yeah.

21:49.950 --> 21:51.660
How dare you put me
in the same class

21:51.660 --> 21:53.830
as dog-level artificial intelligence.

21:55.630 --> 21:56.710
Pencil Missile!

21:58.880 --> 21:59.960
Birdlime Warhead!

22:02.090 --> 22:04.340
Wild Dogpaddle Punch!

22:04.760 --> 22:06.640
Yeah, go for it!

22:06.890 --> 22:08.220
Let's get outta here, Waganma.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.100
Hm?

22:09.140 --> 22:10.180
Come on, hurry up.

22:10.220 --> 22:12.140
W-Wait... How come...?

22:17.480 --> 22:19.230
<i>Don't get distracted.</i>

22:19.570 --> 22:22.990
<i>Right now, I need to focus on getting</i>
<i>Waganma out of harm's way.</i>

23:56.040 --> 24:00.880
{\an8}BRAVE CHILD
