00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.760
Stop eating.

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.000
The main dish isn't here yet.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.319
You're already full from cold dishes.

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:01.000
I brought you here this time

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.959
just to try their

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.079
Squirrel-shaped Mandarin Fish.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.200
It's really delicious.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.680
Save some room in your stomach.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.280
But their serving speed is way too slow.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.199
I'm getting a bit hypoglycemic.

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:11.680
hole-in-the-wall.

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.919
Owner, chef, and waiter are all one person.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.719
Slow serving means it's freshly made.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.120
It's not a pre-made dish.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.159
Look, it's coming.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:21.319
Come on.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.240
Put it here.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:23.159
Here it is.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.479
Your Squirrel-shaped Mandarin Fish.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.800
Wait a moment.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.120
In this Squirrel-shaped Mandarin Fish,

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.800
why isn't there a squirrel?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.319
So if you buy Wife Cake,

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.400
should they give you a wife too?

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.199
It's fine, it's fine.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.479
We met because of Wife Cake.

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.680
We just got our marriage certificate today.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.000
Then I'll get you two squirrels.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.280
Boss.

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.319
Take your time eating.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:47.520
Um...

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.280
We arrived first.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.439
Why did their table get served first?

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:53.039
Did you order?

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:54.039
Didn't you order?

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.560
We did.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.360
How did we not order?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.800
We've been sitting here for ages.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.919
Just this plate of cucumbers.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.800
Maybe the internet lagged and the order didn't go through.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.039
What internet?

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.400
You wrote this by hand.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.879
Look.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.479
Squirrel-shaped Mandarin Fish is written here.

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:05.319
You even misspelled "Mandarin Fish."

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.159
They were rushing me.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.080
We're all regular customers.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.000
Aren't you treating us like outsiders?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I'll get it for you right away, okay?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.520
Right, right.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.560
You can't serve regulars slower.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.439
Your dish takes too long.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.159
How about

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.000
we just cancel it?

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:17.280
Cancel it.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.360
I've already put the fish in the pot.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.039
You want to cancel now?

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:20.840
What pot? You just said we didn't order.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.879
I...

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.439
Meng, your wife is picking a fight.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.919
What?

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.639
How is this picking a fight?

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.400
No, no.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.400
How about this—

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:29.439
That dish,

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:30.439
we still want it.

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.319
Please hurry and make it.

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.080
Okay.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.000
I understand.

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.919
Lili.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.759
Don't argue with him.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.319
Go on.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.080
All set.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.960
I'll get it for you.

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.520
It's tough for everyone.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.919
What's wrong, still upset?

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:58.919
Just over a dish?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Do you think what happened today

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.199
is because I like to argue?

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.520
I'm not saying you like to argue.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.719
I'm saying don't argue with the boss.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.120
It's not worth it.

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.759
I'm still eating here.

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:10.800
It's so awkward.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.879
You're awkward?

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.560
I'm even more awkward today.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.120
In front of so many people,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.879
you side with him, not me.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.600
He seems like your wife.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.560
I feel like an outsider.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.720
What are you saying?

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.199
Isn't that illegal?

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.600
If it were legal, would you live with him?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.759
I'm just joking.

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:27.800
Trying to lighten the mood.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.279
I think this is serious.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.480
Look at your usual personality—

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.759
You never fight for your own rights.

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:36.800
Over time, everyone thinks you're easy to bully.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.439
Then you lose your rights for good.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.439
What rights are you talking about?

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.560
You're blowing this way out of proportion.

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:44.079
I think it's just a meal.

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:45.399
It's not worth fighting over.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.319
It's not about the meal.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.000
Right.

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:49.319
It's about the dish.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.240
Come in.

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.040
Sis.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.399
I want to take off early today.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.800
Meng Meng asked me to visit his colleague at the hospital.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.160
He said it's really serious.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.079
Didn't I hear you argued with Meng Meng?

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:27.279
It wasn't a big deal.

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:28.639
I guess he asked me out

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:30.040
just to make up.

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.639
Making up at the hospital.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.759
Stitching up emotional wounds.

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.120
That's pretty romantic.

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.720
Alright.

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:37.879
There's nothing going on at work anyway.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:38.319
Go ahead.

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.000
Thanks, sis.

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.800
Lao Cha.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.439
I heard you're sick.

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.439
I brought Lili to visit you.

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:50.600
How did this happen?

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:51.560
It's so serious.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:54.399
It's hard to explain.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.920
A couple of days ago,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.959
I was eating at a restaurant.

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.720
And with the chef there,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.879
I got into an argument.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:02.439
I complained he was slow serving.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.079
He complained I was rushing him.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.360
So after going back and forth, we ended up fighting.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.040
This really messed me up.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.920
So embarrassing.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.480
So,

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:13.759
people

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.519
should never act on impulse, no matter what.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:19.480
Getting mad at outsiders is even more pointless.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.279
I'm a living example of that.

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:24.160
A painful lesson.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.040
It was brutal.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.399
Meng Hang,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.199
go buy some fruit for Lao Cha.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.240
It's not good for us to come empty-handed.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.639
No need.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:35.480
Lao Cha is not an outsider.

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:37.000
We're all close colleagues.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.360
Right, just get tomatoes.

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:39.279
Go ahead.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:43.480
Alright.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:44.959
You two chat first.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:46.240
Lao Cha,

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:48.560
share your story with Lili.

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.319
Got it, got it.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.240
Leave it to me.

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:54.319
It's painful.

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:58.079
To be honest,

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.920
how did you get hurt?

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:02.720
I just told the truth.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.040
Stop, stop.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.959
I'm nervous now.

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:07.439
Explain.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.959
No,

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.519
this is for pain relief.

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:10.720
It's tingling now.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.680
I'll talk, I'll talk.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.360
Say it, say it.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:19.160
Xiao Meng

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.360
agreed to cover my shifts for half a month.

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.079
That's why I'm saying all this.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.680
To be his mouth stand-in.

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:26.399
But

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:28.480
I really didn't lie.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:30.480
A chef really beat me up.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.759
That's why I look like this.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.680
That's the reason.

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.439
It's not because I rushed the food.

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:37.399
Then why?

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:39.680
Because

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:42.399
that chef

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:44.199
is my girlfriend's husband.

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:50.240
Lao Cha,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.800
you're such a scumbag.

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:55.319
You're so rotten, you attract flies.

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:56.439
Really?

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:00.720
Well,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.800
I just didn't shower.

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:04.040
Harmony in the family brings prosperity in all things.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.959
Don't act on impulse.

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:07.560
Take my advice.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.800
You're still giving advice?

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:12.639
Lao Cha said it well.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.839
Did he say it well, or did you teach him well?

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:22.720
Did I teach him?

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:24.439
You did.

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:28.000
What did I teach?

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:30.319
Even your looks teach him.

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:31.839
I think

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.759
you must be honest with your wife.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:35.960
If today

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.639
you can lie to her about this,

00:08:37.879 --> 00:08:39.960
you'll lie to her about other things in the future.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.440
Me,

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.240
no matter how many benefits you offer,

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.960
I won't go against my conscience.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.080
and tell lies.

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:48.159
Straightforward.

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:51.600
It's useless, useless.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.480
I'm leaving now.

00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:54.759
You two keep discussing.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.759
Don't get mad.

00:08:58.519 --> 00:08:59.360
Take it slow on the way.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.799
This day...

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.759
Are you crazy?

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.000
Would I come to the hospital if I wasn't sick?

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:11.639
No,

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:14.120
she just pinched my IV tube.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.080
This...

00:09:18.039 --> 00:09:18.679
I'm nervous now.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.679
It's swollen.

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:30.039
Today,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.320
I'll read a submission to everyone.

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.879
It goes like this:

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.200
My husband is really timid.

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:39.679
He always gets lectured by others outside.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:42.559
He doesn't even dare to rush a dish at a restaurant.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.240
But he comes home and lectures his wife.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.720
He's got a whole routine.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.919
He even finds a partner to trick me.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.360
That's not okay.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.399
Mom, who submitted this?

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:56.320
It's pretty unique.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.720
It was just written on a piece of paper and left on my desk.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.879
Isn't that from Li Lili?

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:02.879
Your analysis makes sense.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:04.600
Don't help her here.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.279
You're criticizing me indirectly.

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:08.120
Lili hasn't talked to me for two days.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.039
Can you help me too?

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.320
Why?

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.840
Just because of a dish.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.120
That day,

00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:20.200
we planned to eat together.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.480
After we arrived,

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:33.559
this happened.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.799
Such a small thing.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:35.559
Mom,

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:38.440
You always help others solve problems.

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:40.720
Can you help me this time too?

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:42.600
Don't worry.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.200
I'll help you solve it.

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:53.799
About this dish...

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.360
Here's the situation.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.679
No.

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:56.440
Anyway, I can't get a refund.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.000
That's not how it is.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.639
I—I'll do it.

00:10:57.639 --> 00:10:58.960
I'm not refunding today's dish.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.320
I'm refunding the dish my daughter—

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.519
No one can help today.

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:02.639
This is the first time I've heard

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:04.759
of someone refunding a dish before ordering.

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:07.080
I'm not refunding today's order.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.360
It's the dish my daughter ordered last time.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.919
Who knows who your daughter is?

00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:12.759
My daughter is Li Lili.

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:13.600
Li Lili or whatever...

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.519
Stop making things up here.

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:15.399
Stop filming, stop filming.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.679
There are so many people in my restaurant.

00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:18.600
No, you can't be unreasonable.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.919
You need to fix this, Mom.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.559
Why are you here?

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.799
Is this your mom?

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:24.080
What's wrong?

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:25.039
She wants a refund.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.399
I'm helping you with your problem.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.320
I asked you to solve Li Lili's issue.

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:31.879
Not the dish problem.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.120
If the dish is sorted,

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:34.399
your couple's issue is sorted.

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:35.519
Stay out, let me handle this.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:36.679
Mom.

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:37.639
Today's dish—

00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:38.519
If you don't refund me,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.559
this business—

00:11:39.679 --> 00:11:40.720
I'll make sure you can't run it.

00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:41.360
No, no, no.

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:42.559
I'm telling you now.

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:43.639
Today's dish—

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:44.279
can't be refunded.

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:45.080
You two—

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:45.799
just refund first.

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:52.320
No need to get physical.

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:53.720
Did I get physical?

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.519
Aren't I standing here?

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.480
No, just now—

00:11:57.559 --> 00:11:59.240
I said this dish can't be refunded.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.080
And you two—

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.039
No need to act it out again.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.799
Um...

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.399
My mom—

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:09.720
has mental issues.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.679
Hurry up.

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:11.559
Refund me first.

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:12.440
I'll pay you back later.

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:13.600
Quick, quick, quick.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.879
Refunded, refunded.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.480
Here.

00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:19.360
Transfer to me.

00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:21.480
Transfer to my mom, quick.

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:22.039
Okay.

00:12:22.039 --> 00:12:22.720
You scan first.

00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:25.279
WeChat payment received.

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:26.080
We're leaving.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.919
What a mess.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.759
Let's go.

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:17.519
Meng.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.159
Boss just got off work?

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:22.279
Off work? Off work...

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:24.039
Didn't you see? We're closed.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.759
How could it be closed?

00:13:28.159 --> 00:13:29.240
You have the nerve to ask?

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.000
You just had to refund the dish.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.080
It's just a few dozen yuan.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.320
Whole family had to get involved.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.600
Isn't this just screwing me over?

00:13:36.559 --> 00:13:37.120
No.

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:38.679
I don't get it.

00:13:38.759 --> 00:13:41.639
How is your closure related to my refund?

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.639
Wasn't it that day?

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.879
An old lady came.

00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:45.120
Your mom.

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:46.639
She made a big fuss.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.200
Everyone joined the commotion.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.080
Even the Market Supervision Bureau noticed.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.799
Didn't you get your refund?

00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:52.399
Yeah.

00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:53.919
That was settled.

00:13:53.919 --> 00:13:55.000
But they found something else.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.759
My Hygiene License—

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.679
expired.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.480
Just one day overdue.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.919
Closed for a week for rectification.

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:06.240
Sorry.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.360
Enough.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.320
Look at the trouble this caused.

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:27.759
What a hassle for others.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.960
You could've at least apologized.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.039
Why should I apologize?

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:33.080
His license expired.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.360
It's not my fault.

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:35.759
If it weren't for this,

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:36.679
he wouldn't have been investigated.

00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:37.600
Now the boss—

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.120
has no income for a week.

00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:40.080
Are you happy now?

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:42.360
Don't you feel even a little bad?

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.399
Whether I feel bad or not—

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:44.879
Is this my fault?

00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:46.000
He has no income for a week.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.360
Wasn't it my mom who made a scene?

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.039
I didn't tell her to do it.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.559
If you hadn't made a fuss,

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:52.159
none of this would've happened.

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:53.159
What did I fuss about?

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:54.600
I was fighting for you.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.320
Didn't you let him bully you?

00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:57.600
I got bullied?

00:14:58.399 --> 00:14:59.399
Fighting for me?

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.440
Did I ask you to fight for me?

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.240
Fine, take it or leave it.

00:15:21.799 --> 00:15:22.399
Dad

00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:25.159
This time, Lili really seems mad.

00:15:26.679 --> 00:15:28.879
She sleeps in her mom's room every night now.

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:31.480
No, about this...

00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:32.840
If it were you, what would you do?

00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:36.759
Back then,

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:39.639
your mom often argued with me.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.919
Every time,

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:43.679
I was always the first to give in.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:46.960
Dad,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.360
I get it now.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.399
You don't get a damn thing.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.559
You get it?

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:54.960
Let me tell you,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.000
this is why your mom and I

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.360
ended up divorced.

00:15:57.879 --> 00:15:59.360
You can't repeat my mistakes.

00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:00.879
This isn't about attitude.

00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:02.200
It's a matter of principle.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.720
Think about it.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.559
If you give in now,

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.360
in the future,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.440
she'll make a fuss over everything.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.919
Who could stand that?

00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:08.519
Right?

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.840
Let me ask you this—

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.440
You and her,

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.080
do you want to end up like me and your mom,

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.519
divorced, done with each other?

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.519
So, no way.

00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:18.960
You have to listen to me on this.

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:22.200
You just won't listen to me.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.120
On this backward planet,

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:26.399
where can you find anyone advanced?

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:28.320
You're just a turtle eyeing a green bean.

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:31.440
Don't drag me in when you insult him.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.960
You can doubt Meng Hang,

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:35.639
but don't question my taste in husbands.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080
Meng Meng,

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.919
he's just used to being the nice guy.

00:16:38.919 --> 00:16:40.360
Like, when we have a conflict,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.399
he's always the first to give in.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.000
But this time,

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.720
he's really not backing down.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.679
No way.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.240
Just wait and see.

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:52.480
I'll give him an out soon.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.360
He'll definitely apologize first.

00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:57.200
You must not apologize first.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.960
Wait for her to talk to you.

00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:02.320
Okay.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.400
It's pretty quiet at the table today.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.720
Some people...

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.759
Don't you want to say something?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.759
Sounds like there's a noise.

00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:47.759
What noise?

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:49.920
The sound of a slap in the face.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.519
Not eating anymore?

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.400
I'm full.

00:18:00.759 --> 00:18:02.160
Your trick didn't work either.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.119
Why do I feel she's even angrier?

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.200
She tried to talk to you, and you ignored her.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.519
How could she not be mad?

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.799
That counts as her making the first move?

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:13.759
What else would it be?

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:15.519
Some people, some people...

00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:16.240
Who are these "some people"?

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.039
Me, obviously.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.759
Wasn't that giving you an out?

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:21.519
I get it now.

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:22.720
I'll go now.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.680
Wait, wait, wait.

00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:24.960
You missed your chance to take the out.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.400
Now the out's gone, and you go?

00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:28.519
You'll just end up falling flat on your face.

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:30.799
Take the out when it's offered.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.200
You've rolled out the red carpet,

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:35.000
but he still won't walk on it.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.400
I get it now.

00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:39.119
He's just chickened out.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.519
He's afraid to bring it up,

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.599
worried we'll argue again.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.920
So he just ignores it.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.240
Keep telling yourself that.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.680
You'll get slapped in the face again.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.200
Next time, he'll pretend it never happened.

00:18:51.519 --> 00:18:53.440
He won't dare bring it up again.

00:18:54.039 --> 00:18:54.759
Tomorrow,

00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:57.200
you should talk to her about it.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.079
Sooner or later,

00:18:58.079 --> 00:18:59.559
you'll have to clear the air.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.759
Now it's my turn to make the first move?

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:02.119
Didn't I already do that once?

00:19:02.119 --> 00:19:03.160
It's your turn now.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.559
But we can't stir things up.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.400
We need to

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.920
keep it light and funny.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.039
Talk about it with a natural expression.

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:09.519
Only then

00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:11.079
can you break the awkwardness.

00:19:25.079 --> 00:19:26.359
Witty and humorous.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.079
Natural expression.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.680
This tofu is a bit bland.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.920
That's fermented tofu.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.400
How can your taste be so strong?

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.400
Yeah, this dish—

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.920
it really is a bit salty.

00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:46.079
Well...

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.160
I need to remake it.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.279
Otherwise,

00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:49.240
she'll

00:19:49.839 --> 00:19:51.000
send the dish back again.

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:57.000
Who are you mocking now?

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.559
I was pretty funny just now.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.839
That line was pretty funny.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.200
Am I not funny?

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.880
What you do, that's called—

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.680
being sarcastic.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.519
Meng Hang's not bad.

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:22.720
He's learned my art of language.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.079
Art of language, huh?

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.359
Next time, I'll show him

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.920
the art of body language.

00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:29.880
Violence isn't classy.

00:20:30.599 --> 00:20:31.680
Then I'll use silent treatment.

00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:32.640
If he doesn't apologize,

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:34.440
I'll never speak to him again.

00:20:40.319 --> 00:20:41.000
Dad,

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.039
I know what the problem is now.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:43.839
Where is it?

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:44.920
You.

00:20:45.319 --> 00:20:46.119
Me.

00:20:46.359 --> 00:20:48.039
You keep giving me bad advice.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.279
This kid...

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:51.160
I should give Li Lili

00:20:51.559 --> 00:20:52.880
No, no, no.

00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:54.960
A true lesson in one sentence.

00:20:55.039 --> 00:20:56.680
Fake lessons fill ten books.

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:58.400
I may be a bad example,

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.720
but I'm still an example.

00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:01.079
She's angry right now.

00:21:01.079 --> 00:21:02.279
She won't listen to anything you say.

00:21:02.519 --> 00:21:04.160
Wait until she talks to you.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.880
Then apologize properly.

00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:07.279
And it'll all be over.

00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:54.559
My...

00:22:30.319 --> 00:22:31.119
foot—

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.359
When will it move back?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:36.839
It can't move back anymore.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.000
We can't keep going on like this.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.880
We're almost like strangers now.

00:23:23.119 --> 00:23:25.000
She just keeps ignoring you?

00:23:25.319 --> 00:23:26.400
I even passed her notes.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.319
She didn't respond either.

00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:29.759
That shouldn't be happening.

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:31.720
The urgent thing now is

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.200
to get her to move back in with you.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.160
Once you're sharing a room,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.200
how could you not talk?

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.160
Once you talk, the problem will pass.

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:40.759
So when should I ask her

00:23:41.039 --> 00:23:42.440
to move back in with me?

00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:43.200
This

00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:44.759
can't wait.

00:23:45.319 --> 00:23:46.359
Don't wait for the right moment.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.039
Just tell her at dinner.

00:23:50.079 --> 00:23:50.960
These past days,

00:23:51.079 --> 00:23:52.680
the atmosphere at home is awkward.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.480
You see,

00:23:55.359 --> 00:23:57.240
find a chance to make up.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.440
Mom, that doesn't sound like you.

00:24:01.759 --> 00:24:03.960
I'm just thinking, if you two split up,

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.799
how much would moving cost?

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:08.839
Would he really kick us both out?

00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:10.839
Stop saying "us both" all the time.

00:24:11.079 --> 00:24:12.599
It's you and him who split up.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.640
You move out.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.200
I have no beef with him.

00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:16.519
I'm staying right here.

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:17.519
Fine.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.920
I don't buy it.

00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:20.279
If he tells me to leave,

00:24:20.279 --> 00:24:21.480
I'll move out right away.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.000
You've been proven wrong before.

00:24:24.759 --> 00:24:26.039
Don't let me hear that again.

00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:26.920
Bang.

00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:28.960
Bang.

00:24:45.079 --> 00:24:46.160
I'm telling you,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.400
you and Mom living in that room

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.240
isn't really working.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.160
Did you hear that?

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.880
Your love went from touching

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.240
to literally kicking people out.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:58.920
Right.

00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:01.680
I feel the same way.

00:25:02.079 --> 00:25:03.640
Yeah, we can't drag this out.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.960
We need to fix this.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.079
Right.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.599
I also think we should

00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:09.559
take some time apart to cool off.

00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:16.160
I'll stay at your place for now.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.279
Sorry for the trouble.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.680
I've already found a place.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.200
No time like the present.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.119
I'll move out right now.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.640
Where did you find a place?

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.759
Moving company, right?

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:31.759
I want to book a truck.

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:33.000
I need it now.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.839
The sooner, the better.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.960
Building 8, Unit 701, West District, Fanhuali.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.319
Wait, wait, wait.

00:25:37.319 --> 00:25:38.079
Okay, okay, fine.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.119
Don't be impulsive.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.079
Let's talk calmly.

00:25:40.079 --> 00:25:41.359
If talking doesn't work, we can sing.

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:41.839
Right?

00:25:42.119 --> 00:25:43.000
Dad, Dad, Dad.

00:25:48.279 --> 00:25:49.079
Is this really necessary?

00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:51.200
It is.

00:25:52.079 --> 00:25:53.480
And since we've broken up,

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.039
some things need to be settled.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.240
I bought this kettle.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.160
I'm taking it with me.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.000
You're serious?

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.720
I bought those clothes for you.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:06.960
I'm taking them.

00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:09.680
So we're splitting things?

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.400
Fine then.

00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:13.559
I'll return the clothes you bought me first.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.480
Everything else, we split fifty-fifty.

00:26:36.119 --> 00:26:36.759
Wait,

00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:37.519
you two acting like this

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.440
isn't good.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.839
Dad, stay out of it.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.440
No,

00:26:42.039 --> 00:26:42.640
this

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.799
gourd

00:26:44.759 --> 00:26:45.640
is mine.

00:26:47.079 --> 00:26:48.240
I've polished it for six years.

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:50.400
Three more years to go.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.359
Can't you split something valuable?

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:03.160
Alright.

00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:04.880
I want this sofa.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.359
Fine, you can have the sofa.

00:27:09.359 --> 00:27:10.359
But let me tell you,

00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:11.359
on this sofa

00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:13.880
are all our happy movie nights together.

00:27:14.839 --> 00:27:15.599
I don't want it anymore.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.960
It's all yours.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.480
That's low.

00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:23.799
I want this bowl.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:25.839
Take it.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.240
Isn't this the bowl you used

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.359
to make instant noodles for me the first time?

00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:29.480
To be honest with you,

00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:30.839
I'd already eaten that day.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.000
I don't want it.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.960
I want this puzzle.

00:28:57.839 --> 00:28:59.440
Coming, coming, coming.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.680
Who is it?

00:29:03.319 --> 00:29:03.880
Hello.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.599
Are you

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.640
from the moving company?

00:29:06.839 --> 00:29:07.680
What are you moving?

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.000
All this stuff.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.839
Starting price is fifteen hundred per truck.

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:14.160
That's so expensive!

00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:15.799
Why don't you just rob me?

00:29:16.599 --> 00:29:17.400
You don't have to move.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.480
Cancel the order on the app.

00:29:18.599 --> 00:29:20.279
But there's a five hundred service fee for coming out.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.920
You have to pay that.

00:29:22.279 --> 00:29:23.200
Five hundred?

00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:24.680
Five hundred is a bit much.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.960
Five hundred just for showing up?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.960
Who made that rule?

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.680
Is it the business bureau or the tax office?

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:34.440
I'll call and complain about you, believe it or not.

00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:36.400
Wait, what do you do?

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.839
No one else is complaining.

00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:39.000
You're the only one nitpicking.

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:40.240
Scan the code, five hundred.

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:40.839
Wait a second.

00:29:42.359 --> 00:29:44.000
What do you mean, nitpicking?

00:29:44.319 --> 00:29:46.000
I've learned something these days.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.319
Some things

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:50.440
you have to fight for.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.599
If you don't, they're gone.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.839
She's not moving anymore.

00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:00.680
You guys can leave now.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.680
Are you moving or not?

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:03.559
In our business, we never leave empty-handed.

00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:04.599
You owe us five hundred yuan.

00:30:05.079 --> 00:30:05.920
Thief!

00:30:06.039 --> 00:30:06.880
Can't leave with nothing.

00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:09.599
Go find whoever's moving.

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:10.039
Get out.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.160
Without that five hundred, we can't do this.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:11.640
Get out.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.480
Alright, alright, alright.

00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:13.680
You haven't moved anything.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.319
Right?

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.440
How about half price?

00:30:15.559 --> 00:30:16.160
Two hundred fifty.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.680
We can't accept that price.

00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:18.759
The three of us can't split it.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.799
You have to pay two hundred forty.

00:30:20.839 --> 00:30:21.960
I just have one hundred eighty.

00:30:22.119 --> 00:30:23.960
Plus three concert tickets for you.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.519
One hundred eighty.

00:30:24.519 --> 00:30:25.240
Come on, come on.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.880
A rock superstar will hand them to you.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.720
Come on, come on.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.799
Bro, you play rock music?

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.200
What's the point of playing it?

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.200
Did I try hard enough this time?

00:30:48.839 --> 00:30:49.559
Sorry.

00:30:52.839 --> 00:30:54.000
Say it again.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.880
I like hearing it.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.720
Let's talk inside.

00:31:00.519 --> 00:31:01.000
No way.

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:02.640
If you don't say it,

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.880
I'm not going in.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.039
Who split my God of Wealth in half?

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:12.000
Let's just talk inside.

00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:24.000
About this matter...

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.359
It proves what I've always thought.

00:31:26.599 --> 00:31:28.680
What Earthlings call feelings

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.279
are really just impulses.

00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:31.880
One impulse, they're together.

00:31:32.119 --> 00:31:33.559
Another impulse, they break up.

00:31:34.839 --> 00:31:35.839
Overall,

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.880
it's childish.

00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:38.200
And thoughtless.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:38.880
What?

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.319
You and my dad never argue?

00:31:40.319 --> 00:31:40.960
Look at you.

00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:43.079
You never married on the home planet.

00:31:43.079 --> 00:31:43.880
You don't get it, do you?

00:31:44.519 --> 00:31:46.720
On our planet, we don't like to argue.

00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:49.319
If there's conflict, we duel.

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:51.319
Whoever gets killed is in the wrong.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:53.599
It's fine.

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:56.359
Just toss them in the regeneration chamber.

00:31:57.039 --> 00:31:58.839
Our medical tech is advanced.

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:00.559
See my head here?

00:32:00.759 --> 00:32:02.400
It's already my sixth one.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.960
A gentleman argues with words, not fists.

00:32:04.079 --> 00:32:05.039
Better not fight.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:05.880
We argue too.

00:32:06.519 --> 00:32:07.359
Home planet.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.759
We have mind reading.

00:32:09.559 --> 00:32:10.839
Everyone curses in their mind.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.720
The other side hears it anyway.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Just watch.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.759
It's all very dignified.

00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:18.799
How did I end up with such a silly daughter?

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.559
Two years away and you forgot our home planet's culture.

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:24.039
You really think you're a spiritual Earthling now.

00:32:24.279 --> 00:32:26.000
You're just worshipping foreign things.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.359
Alright, alright, enough.

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:28.319
No, no need to show off.
