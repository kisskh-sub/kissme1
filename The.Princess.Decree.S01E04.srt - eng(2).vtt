00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.200
I...

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:29.959
Since you refuse to speak,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.840
I'll give you a piece of calligraphy.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.680
Your Highness, General Gan is here.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.020
(Clear Waters Stained With Ink)

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.620
(Clear Waters Stained With Ink)

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:36.599
Actually,

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.840
I stopped caring
about that answer long ago.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.599
I just wanted you to know

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.199
I'm the biggest stain on your life.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.680
A

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.960
false

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:58.400
gentleman.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:14.199
General.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.960
Her Highness said

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.879
ordinary punishment is useless

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.120
to someone like Li Yuanze.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.280
Only in this way

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:23.479
can we grind down his arrogance.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.400
Nonsense.

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.199
General, you can't go in.

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:37.199
Gan Sheng.

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.479
How dare you?

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.120
How dare you draw your sword at me?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.240
You know very well

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.360
who I'm drawing this blade at.

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.280
Last time I tried to kill Li Yuanze,

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.000
you stopped me.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.479
Now, you're stopping me again.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.360
You keep stopping me.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.080
Could it be

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.080
that you have ulterior motives?

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.639
Or

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.040
do you still have feelings for him?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.319
Don't forget

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.920
how you got here.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.839
You've always

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.199
belonged to me.

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:36.639
Insolence.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.639
Since you allied with me,

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.720
you should remember your promise.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.720
Now, you nitpick me at every turn

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.700
and have no trust in me.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:48.920
If that's the case,

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:53.360
the schemes I've been helping you with

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:54.839
end now.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.360
What schemes?

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.120
Lin Jue of Ministry of Revenue

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:09.920
will summon the civil officials
under the pretext of his birthday.

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:11.759
I already planned

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.279
to bring Li Yuanze there

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.560
and humiliate him publicly.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.160
Let them all see

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:19.079
that their only hope

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:21.519
has long fallen under my skirts.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.240
Only then

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.839
can we shake the civil court's morale

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.560
and find our opportunity.

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.319
Besides,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.680
don't you also need

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:38.560
a puppet like me to take the blame?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.040
Right?

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.480
I acted rashly

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.480
and let your kindness go to waste.

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:10.680
My grip was a bit too strong.

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.879
You should rest.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.000
Your Highness.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.759
Don't let anger harm your health.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.079
Fool.

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:36.800
Princess Royal is too much.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.380
How could she treat you like that?

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:39.959
We still

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:41.319
need her cooperation.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.759
If she's just a cat showing its claws,

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.720
playing along won't hurt.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.959
But if she has bigger ambitions...

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.240
Keep an eye on her.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.680
Don't spare

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.560
anyone who shouldn't be spared.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.120
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.100
How have you been lately?

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:09.519
Thank you all

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.759
for coming to celebrate my birthday.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:14.920
(Lin Jue, Vice Minister of Revenue)
A toast to everyone.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.199
- Congratulations, Official Lin.
- Cheers.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.639
This liquor tastes excellent.

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:22.560
On Official Lin's birthday,

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:24.920
I've brought my new pet to celebrate.

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:47.720
Why don't you all guess

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:49.560
who this is?

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.439
Who?

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.879
Isn't this Official Li?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.319
It's indeed Official Li.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.360
Yuanze!

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:13.720
This is outrageous.

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:17.800
You've gone too far!

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:20.839
Insolence!

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:22.720
How dare you disrespect Princess Royal?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.480
Someone, seize him.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.290
Your Highness, calm your anger.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.080
Absolutely disgraceful.

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:50.720
Truly intolerable.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.879
What?

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:56.240
You want to speak up for him?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.039
But I

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.759
can't bear to punish you.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.039
She's utterly lawless.

00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:05.519
We're in broad daylight.

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.540
(Zhang Bowen, Left Censor-in-Chief)

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:16.960
Your Highness.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.639
Stop.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.039
Beg me.

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:35.320
I beg you.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.200
I didn't hear you.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.159
Say it again.

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:45.960
I

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.240
beg you.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.559
How shameful.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.639
This is utterly improper.

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:02.200
Let's leave!

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.180
Official Zhang is right.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.000
Official Zhang.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.600
Let's leave.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.260
I can't watch this either.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:07.320
Outrageous.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.879
How unlucky.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.600
Such a joyous occasion ruined.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.879
Princess Royal.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Official Zhang
had a bit too much to drink earlier

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.919
and is feeling unwell.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.600
Please forgive him.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.540
(Wang Huan, Vice Minister of Personnel)

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.080
The way Official Li looks

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.480
is truly remarkable.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.519
On such a lovely night,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.799
why not improvise a poem?

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:47.679
Take your affection

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.639
for Your Highness as inspiration.

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:50.679
Make it bold.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.879
Make it sensual.

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:53.720
Only then is it worthy

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.159
of Her Highness's divine beauty.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.399
Insolence.

00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:10.080
Who are you

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.679
to order my man around?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.240
Someone.

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:14.399
Take him away.

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:16.080
Make him kneel for six hours.

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:18.800
Your Highness, have mercy.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.039
Your Highness, have mercy!

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:22.039
Your Highness, have mercy.
Your Highness.

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:22.759
I was wrong.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.210
I shouldn't have spoken out of turn!

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.639
I know my mistake.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:26.879
Your Highness!

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.639
Your Highness, have mercy!

00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:30.320
Your Highness.

00:11:30.679 --> 00:11:31.279
Your Highness.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.320
Staying with you stuffy scholars

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:40.840
is such a bore.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.799
Xing.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.519
You stay here

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:51.120
and catch up with your friends.

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:55.720
You'll come back obediently tonight.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.279
Won't you?

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.000
Your Highness.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.080
Keep your eyes
on whoever approached him first

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:30.480
and what they said.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.360
Yes.

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:40.639
Just finding a bookseller

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.639
is really enough to lure Mr. Qingya out?

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:44.639
All of Mr. Qingya's play scripts

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:46.420
were sent to Beijiang through him.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:48.780
Hopefully.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.820
As per your instructions,

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.180
I recorded

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.060
all the guests' behavior just now.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.260
Those who flattered or wavered

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.260
are all recorded here.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.900
A fence-sitter like Vice Minister Wang

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.980
is a sore sight.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.600
Deal with him when the chance arises.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.900
Official Zhang

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.660
is a man of action.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.100
(Zhang Bowen)
These people

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.340
must be retained.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.380
Yes.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.700
It's a pity they don't understand.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.580
They might mistake your protection

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.700
for oppression.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.820
Doing the right thing

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.460
needs no one's understanding.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.660
We sent several visiting cards

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.900
as per procedure,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.780
but Mr. Qingya didn't respond.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.060
This was our last resort.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:39.500
Forgive me.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.020
Do you always summon people this way?

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.820
Apologies.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.300
I was impolite.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.420
I couldn't see you
with ordinary methods.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.020
Xing.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:22.860
Apologies.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.980
May I

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.740
have eight minutes?

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.660
I came to see you

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.980
to thank you in person.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.740
I have never met you.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.220
Why thank me?

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.420
Though we have not met,

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.260
I've long since

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.780
memorized your Qingya and White Deer

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.820
by heart.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.860
Five years in Beijiang,

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.340
surrounded by ice and frost.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.820
It helped me survive.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.380
It showed me

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.900
that there are people

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.220
who never yield to hardship

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.820
and can rise again
in desperate circumstances.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.500
Out of gratitude,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.260
whatever you ask of me,

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.860
be it rare books

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.060
or your career,

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.980
I will do my utmost

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.340
to repay you.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.180
You overstated.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.660
When I wrote it,

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.940
I never sought anything in return.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.380
A story meeting a kindred soul

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.980
is already a blessing.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.180
Yet I always feel

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.540
the Princess Zhaoyang in the play script

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.100
resembles me in some ways.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.700
All beings in this world

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.860
are protagonists of their own lives.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.740
Partings and reunions,
fortunes and fates.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.780
They're mostly
just similar coincidences.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.140
Does the story have a continuation?

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:38.780
Your Highness.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.340
Not all stories

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.380
have continuations.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.540
Regardless,

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.420
I'm grateful you wrote this story.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.740
Should the day come

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.620
that you need me,

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.220
I will always be at your service.
