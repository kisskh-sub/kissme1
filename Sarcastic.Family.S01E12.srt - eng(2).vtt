00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.280
Fate, you know.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.040
It's not a shooting star.

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:53.439
It's a comet.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:54.280
Look.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.040
It flashes by in an instant.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.560
It seems to have gone far away.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.359
But you never know when,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.280
it suddenly comes back again.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.280
Bringing warmth

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.639
and sweetness.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.560
I'll kill you, you brat!

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:15.039
What are you doing?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.159
I'm livestreaming.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.159
There's a

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.919
wasp in the house.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.199
Is it as crazy as you?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.000
Did it even bother you?

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.199
I got stung by a wasp as a kid.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.159
I had to stay in the hospital for two months.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520
If it weren't for that wasp,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.840
I wouldn't have

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.599
missed Peking University by five points.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.520
Today I have to

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:33.719
get my revenge.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.360
Can't you see I'm livestreaming?

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.120
Is your stream more important, or my revenge?

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.680
Revenge is more important.

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.400
I have over a thousand followers.

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.759
I'm kind of an influencer, right?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.879
You, an influencer?

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:46.439
Let me tell you,

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.479
real influencers have over ten million followers.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.479
You only have a thousand.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.439
That's less than the audience

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.840
at our neighborhood party.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.479
A thousand followers...

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.120
Can your crappy livestream make money?

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.599
Can your crappy pet shop make money?

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.080
At least I don't lose money on it.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.759
Don't underestimate me.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.400
I'm about to earn five hundred thousand.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:03.800
Five hundred thousand?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.840
Are you drunk on fake booze?

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:09.280
What?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.639
A reward.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.439
Its fur treatment

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.120
costs more than your hair perm.

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.520
I've already sent our shop's most

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.439
capable employee.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.599
to handle this.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.240
I'm determined to get that five hundred thousand.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.400
Capable employee?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.400
Li Cai.

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.400
He'd be lucky not to lose himself.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.120
You'll have to pay to find him later.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.199
I'm warning you,

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:30.039
don't mess things up again.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:31.759
Let's continue.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.840
A friend left a comment:

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.599
Life is cruel.

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.199
Truth is bare.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.360
Who told you to undress on camera?

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.199
No, I...

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:46.439
The wasp,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.800
it crawled into my clothes.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.840
See?

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.759
The Livey Room got a warning.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.639
Look at this.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.960
Go back, go back.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.000
Hurry back, hurry back.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.159
When I'm livestreaming,

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.400
don't come out, you hear me?

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:00.560
You filmed me!

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.719
You owe me a portrait fee!

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.759
Go back, now!

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.040
Wasp! Wasp!

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.560
Open the door! Open the door!

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.879
No, we agreed—

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.120
Each band member gets five thousand.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.399
Send it all to my account.

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:41.040
Then I'll transfer it to the record company.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:43.240
I still haven't got Lao Xiang's money.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.319
He won't answer my calls.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.240
What does that mean?

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.639
Don't count on him.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.439
He won't answer me either.

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.000
Remember the song he wrote last month?

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.519
You call that a song?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.519
You're my traffic jam,

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:00.000
I'm your honey-glazed ham.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.319
Let's jingle together.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.800
That song...

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.480
He wouldn't get mad just because I said

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:11.920
his song was bad, would he?

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.399
He's not that petty, right?

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:14.759
You don't know—

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.879
His song online

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.120
is super popular.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.639
Lots of short videos

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.480
use his song as background music.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.079
Are you kidding?

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.040
That song is a hit?

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.120
Anyway,

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:29.560
he's a big influencer now.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.040
His livestream sales in one day

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.120
make tens of thousands.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.279
Why bother with an album?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.079
Tens of thousands?

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.160
Livestreaming makes that much?

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:43.839
Not always.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.879
You need traffic first.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.720
I have traffic!

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.600
My phone

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.279
gets several gigabytes a month.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.600
Not phone data.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.680
You need viewers for your stream.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.600
If no one's watching,

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:57.839
who are you selling to?

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.399
Let me roughly estimate

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:11.279
after doing the math.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.560
Those with a million followers

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.879
can sell hundreds of thousands a day.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.920
Your mom only has a bit over one thousand fans,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.319
so she can only sell a few hundred yuan.

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:19.199
But even that

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:20.439
is pretty great.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.120
Can you help me talk to your mom?

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.240
It's such a good opportunity.

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.839
You should tell her yourself.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.560
Okay, I'll say it.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.199
It's just...

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.480
I feel a bit awkward.

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:29.399
It's kind of embarrassing.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.879
What's embarrassing about earning money livestreaming?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.199
Lately, we've

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.920
mainly had some disagreements.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:37.600
What kind of disagreement?

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:39.319
I told her

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.120
her crappy livestream doesn't make money.

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:48.240
That was a bit awkward.

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:49.079
Right?

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.439
Li Lili

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.560
Li Li

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.399
You know,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.680
us old bandmates,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.759
it's really tough running a band.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.160
We haven't made a cent this year.

00:06:59.199 --> 00:06:59.720
Why?

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.639
We couldn't sell any tickets.

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.560
We're chasing art.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.000
Is art something to be sold?

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:08.360
I'd rather sell goods on livestream myself

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.439
than sell out my art.

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:10.279
You know what that's called?

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:11.920
Sell the body, not the art.

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.040
That's called having a dream.

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:16.399
It's been forty years.

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:18.959
We went from dream-chasing youths

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.399
to dream-chasing elders.

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:21.519
Still haven't made it.

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:23.079
Our dream of releasing an album.

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:26.959
Are we selling goods in our livestreams?

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:28.240
No.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:29.920
We're mourning.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.319
To honor our lost youth.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.720
Let our youth

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.120
be revived through music.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.199
As the saying goes,

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:38.680
the soul of music lingers on.

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:43.680
I get it.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.519
Dad,

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:45.759
don't worry.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.680
To keep your music soul alive,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.439
I'll definitely persuade Mom

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.040
to help you earn money livestreaming

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:52.279
and fulfill your album dream.

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:53.879
That's great!

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:56.000
Other ways to make money

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.120
we can't give up either.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.600
We need to try both.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.839
And do both well.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.600
Alright.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.120
Eat, eat, eat.

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:02.720
Come on, come on.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.399
This one's sweet.

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:04.040
This one's tasty.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.600
What's up, Uncle Meng?

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:13.920
Guess.

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:14.839
That thing you...

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:15.800
How's your search going?

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:16.399
Guess.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.439
Guess my train, huh?

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:18.399
Just tell me already!

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:19.839
I found one,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.839
a stray,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:21.800
brown,

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:22.600
furry,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.279
recently lost.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.720
That's all correct!

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.000
Wait, show it to me now.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.759
But...

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:29.639
But what?

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:30.560
Hurry up!

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.600
But it's a cat.

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:32.480
Not a dog.

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:33.720
Is this joke funny?

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:34.919
Is it amusing?

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.440
No.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.559
I'm not joking.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.759
It seems pretty close to me.

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:38.159
I was thinking,

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.360
let's take it to the shop and keep it for now.

00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:41.000
It doesn't eat much cat food anyway.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.200
Forget about the cat for now.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.440
I told you to find a dog.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.240
Dog, dog, dog, go find a dog!

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:45.919
Don't...

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:46.440
Don't worry about the cat.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.200
Go look for the dog.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.279
You get paid if you find the dog.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.120
Five hundred.

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:49.879
Alright!

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:52.600
Let's go.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.399
Not helping, not helping.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.320
He isn't...

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.519
He said it.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.279
He found a curly-haired dog.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.480
Could earn five hundred thousand.

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.639
Would even notice my crappy account?

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.720
He also said

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.480
something about a community party.

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:13.120
Even that has more viewers than my account.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.440
I'm not helping him.

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:15.799
Mom,

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:18.720
Meng Hang's dad was just joking around.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.480
Now everyone can earn money together.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.720
Isn't that great?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.320
Can we really make money?

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.600
Why not?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.399
My dad's friend Lao Xiang,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.159
you know him, right?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.519
His Livey Room

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:30.320
sells hundreds of thousands a day.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.480
So...

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:33.200
I can make that money too!

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.200
Exactly.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.840
So...

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.240
Life is just

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:49.159
two lonely hearts

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.559
drawing closer together.

00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:54.559
What are you doing?

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:55.639
Posting to Moments.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.120
Visible only to Lao Xiang.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:57.799
He

00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:59.279
just lost his spouse.

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:00.919
Oh, come on.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.360
Stop being dramatic.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.279
He just remarried.

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:04.639
Really

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.440
not funny.

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:07.879
If you have the time,

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:08.840
think about

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.039
how to monetize your few fans.

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:12.960
If you sell products now,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.519
they're all from my dad's shop.

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:16.279
You have zero cost.

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:17.879
So how do we split it?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.480
You and my dad split fifty-fifty.

00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:20.360
That works too.

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:21.879
I get ninety-five percent.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.919
He gets half a percent.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.279
Just take it all.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.840
Fine by me.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.919
What do you mean, fine?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.039
Sixty-forty, you get sixty.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.679
One to nine.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.200
I get nine.

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:29.639
Sixty-forty, you get sixty.

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:30.440
It's settled then.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.799
Meng Hang and I did all the work for nothing.

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:32.399
Alright.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.519
Guess I'll take the loss.

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:35.720
What are you up to now?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.799
Let me tell you,

00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:37.879
inside this book

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.080
red envelopes can grow.

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:39.720
I'll show you.

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:40.639
Look, look, look.

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:42.519
See? Look.

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:43.440
So many now.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.120
I found this many.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.519
These are Meng Hang's

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:46.919
red envelopes from childhood.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.399
His dad hid them here.

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:53.159
I discovered them.

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:55.120
One to nine, I get nine.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.480
Welc— Welc—

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.600
Welcome, every—

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.639
Where were you this morning?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.200
Stop wandering around.

00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:14.840
Welcome everyone to my livestream.

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:18.039
What's going on?

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:19.120
Why did it buzz me?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:19.879
Dad,

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:21.120
um,

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:23.159
You said forbidden words.

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:24.159
You got a warning.

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:26.919
I only said one thing.

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:27.679
How was that forbidden?

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:28.879
You can't say "livestream room."

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:30.039
You have to say "Livey Room."

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:32.600
What is this?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.360
Livestream platform.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.480
They don't allow "livestream room"?

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:34.960
Well,

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:37.879
Just say it differently.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.279
Welcome everyone to my Livey Room.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.639
Watch my live—

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:46.519
Livey—

00:11:47.559 --> 00:11:50.000
Last thing, don't use repeated words.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.080
If you act cute at this age,

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:53.240
it's just gross.

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:54.879
What are you doing?

00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:55.759
So many people are watching.

00:11:55.759 --> 00:11:57.480
You really shouldn't do that.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:57.759
You—

00:11:58.279 --> 00:11:59.399
What's wrong now?

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:00.679
It's best not to say

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:04.240
this word.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:04.960
It's easy

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.480
for people to think we're faking it.

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:09.600
I didn't say this product is the best.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.279
I said this—

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.960
I—I said she should best be—

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:13.360
Dad, dad, dad—

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:14.000
Let's, let's—

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.960
Let's just turn it off first.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.480
No more talking.

00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:18.159
No more.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.919
Saying forbidden words too much

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.240
can get you banned.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.840
If the account gets banned,

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.799
I'll kill you.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.480
I'm mute.

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:27.600
Um, so, so, like this—

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:28.440
Let's first—

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.039
make a list.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.279
Let's sum up

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.759
which forbidden words we can say,

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:33.639
which we can't.

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:34.600
I'll write it down for you.

00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:36.240
Alright.

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:39.720
I see you know livestreams well.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.200
You watch them a lot, right?

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.519
Not at all, not familiar.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:44.200
Occasionally.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.360
I watch a little, sometimes.

00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:48.519
But I've never sent them gifts.

00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:49.759
Them—

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.399
Who are they?

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.320
Them, well—

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.159
They're definitely not boys.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.639
No.

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:55.600
They're definitely

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.600
boys.

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:57.840
All guys.

00:12:57.919 --> 00:12:59.440
Like you, your hometown buddies—

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.399
Like Li Zongheng,

00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:01.600
and Lao Si.

00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:03.200
Yeah, Lao Si.

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:04.080
Last time,

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.519
the girl who danced really well—

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:06.679
You sent her a fan lightstick.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.759
Who was that?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.600
Right.

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:12.279
That's Lao Si.

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:14.120
That Lao Si.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:14.720
He

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.120
put on a wig

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.440
and danced with people.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.039
See?

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.720
None of that matters.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.919
Not important at all.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.519
What matters is

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:22.960
we need to fix the forbidden words.

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:23.559
Right?

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.679
I'll hurry and write it down.

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:25.960
You all need to study up.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.960
What are forbidden words.

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:28.000
Stand right there.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.399
Why is livestreaming so hard?

00:13:37.559 --> 00:13:39.200
So many forbidden words?

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:42.200
This is the full list of forbidden words.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.080
This one

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.600
is all the forbidden words.

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:50.080
Then just tell us the words

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.720
we're allowed to say.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.639
Feels like that's a much shorter list.

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:53.320
It's livestreaming,

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.639
so we have to be careful.

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:56.120
You two, please take note of this.

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:58.679
Can't say this, can't say that...

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.759
Might as well livestream in sign language.

00:14:00.879 --> 00:14:02.200
Yeah, let's just use gestures.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.720
Our dog food

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.720
is low-priced.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.759
Then just gesture it.

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:08.000
Your gesture means

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.080
I'm worse off than a dog.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.159
You really know sign language!

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:10.879
Yeah.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.279
Let me show you another one.

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:14.399
Me.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.159
Brain, brain.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.879
I understood that one.

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:18.879
She said it's your brain.

00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:19.679
I got it too.

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:20.440
No need to translate.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.000
It's waterlogged.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.720
All water.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:27.879
Hello, everyone.

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:29.279
Welcome to our

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.279
Livey Room.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.320
This friend asked how much our dog food costs.

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:36.840
Here's the thing.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.159
Our dog food is

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.679
sold by the kilo, not by "mi".

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:40.919
"Mi" is for buying fabric.

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:42.519
Not this one.

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:43.600
Not that "mi".

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.679
Yes, yes, yes.

00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:45.600
That word.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.720
Which one?

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:48.879
Money.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.279
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:54.679
Hello, friend.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.840
Our

00:14:55.919 --> 00:14:57.159
dog food is

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.840
five kilograms, ninety-nine

00:14:59.200 --> 00:14:59.600
mi.

00:14:59.679 --> 00:14:59.919
Right.

00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:01.000
If you

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:02.320
search the whole internet,

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.320
ours is still the

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.200
most

00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:07.879
likely cheaper than elsewhere.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.840
A little bit cheaper.

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:14.200
Is that even human grammar?

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:15.960
Aren't we not allowed to say "cheapest"?

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.039
I...

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:18.720
Let me do it.

00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:18.960
I'll do it.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.480
Come on, come on.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.120
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:21.559
Hello, everyone.

00:15:21.799 --> 00:15:24.120
See this dog food in my hand?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.639
Its quality...

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.159
is just so-so.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.480
Anyway, it won't kill your dog.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:29.559
Look.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.840
This is

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.840
an electric

00:15:32.159 --> 00:15:33.120
cat litter box.

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:34.559
Electric cat litter box.

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:36.799
How is it different from a regular litter box?

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.000
Of course it's different.

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:38.840
Because it

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.799
uses more electricity.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.559
Look.

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:42.159
There's also

00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:43.120
cat toys.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:43.960
Cats

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.679
might not even like them.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.080
But our streamer

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.759
definitely loves to play.

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:53.960
Look, look how much fun he's having.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.600
What?

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:55.200
Aren't you—

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.360
Yes, yes, yes.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.759
You didn't use any forbidden words.

00:15:57.919 --> 00:15:59.200
But people still won't buy our stuff.

00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:00.399
Are you helping or making trouble?

00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:03.919
Actually, more viewers showed up.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.480
Let me see.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.840
Someone here said—

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.120
Uncle Meng is so cute.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.799
Make her laugh again and she'll order.

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:11.679
She called me cute?

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.559
Sorry, I'm a little shy.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.679
Yeah, I'm embarrassed.

00:16:16.879 --> 00:16:17.519
I'll just go for it.

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:18.080
Whatever, I don't care.

00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:19.600
It's all for the sales.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.519
Come on, keep joking.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.159
Keep joking.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:24.960
Can't reach it.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.799
Where is it? Where?

00:16:26.679 --> 00:16:27.120
Over there.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:27.759
No, it's not.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.759
This side, here, here.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.960
Gone again. Where is it? Where?

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.960
Are you really going all out?

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.480
Looks like you're enjoying this.

00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:34.559
Darn it, darn it.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.320
Your moves are way too creepy.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.000
Got a warning, right?

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.159
No, Mom—

00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:40.559
That's the sound for a successful sale.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:41.960
Thank you.

00:16:42.159 --> 00:16:43.240
Thanks to the user named—

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:45.159
"Peaceful Years" for placing an order.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:45.600
Thank you, thank you.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.279
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.360
Friends, friends—

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.879
If we get twenty orders—

00:16:48.919 --> 00:16:49.919
My dad will immediately—

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.200
Climb the cat tree.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.320
Everyone's liking it.

00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:56.279
So much popularity.

00:16:56.279 --> 00:16:57.679
Top traffic is really something else.

00:16:57.799 --> 00:16:59.279
No need to be so enthusiastic, everyone.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.600
Shipping so many orders at once—

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.160
The logistics will get seriously jammed.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.000
So many people ordering.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.359
Okay.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:07.799
Really?

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:08.519
Mom, Mom, Mom—

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.240
No, no, no—

00:17:10.759 --> 00:17:13.599
Got repeated first-level forbidden word warnings.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:16.160
What did I say?

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.240
What did I say?

00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:17.880
Let me think.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.599
What you just said—

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.240
What did I say?

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.359
All at once.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:24.359
All at once.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.759
Sexy.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:29.359
That can't be it.

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:30.200
There must be more after that.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:30.720
Let me think.

00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:34.079
Logistics jam.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.319
Logistics.

00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:37.319
Porn.

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:40.079
No, this—

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:42.279
This counts too?

00:17:42.319 --> 00:17:43.680
Yeah, does this count too?

00:17:43.759 --> 00:17:44.880
Talk to customer service.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.920
Try to appeal.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.640
It's useless.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.359
Can't send any messages now.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.680
Why is it blacked out?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.640
It's blacked out.

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:53.960
Locked in the little black room.

00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:57.319
Because earlier there were repeated—

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.519
Forbidden words piling up.

00:17:59.279 --> 00:17:59.720
Now—

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.759
The account is banned.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.079
You owe me my account.

00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:11.480
Compensate? Compensate for what?

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:11.880
You, you—

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.400
This account only had a bit over one thousand fans.

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:15.039
Just apply for another one.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.000
Enough, enough, enough.

00:18:16.079 --> 00:18:17.720
I'll give you an extra hundred from today's earnings.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.319
That settles it.

00:18:18.759 --> 00:18:19.839
Settled.

00:18:20.319 --> 00:18:23.359
What do one thousand fans mean to me?

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.039
If each throws me a brick—

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:26.240
I could build a courtyard house.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.200
If each gives me one thousand yuan—

00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:29.920
I'd have a million already.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.279
You're extorting me.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.160
Who counts like you?

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.799
It's just a crappy account.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.640
Crappy account.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.119
I'm not done with you.

00:18:43.319 --> 00:18:43.799
Mom.

00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:44.960
Isn't that a bit much?

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.000
What are you doing?

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.319
Mom.

00:18:50.599 --> 00:18:52.079
When making money—

00:18:52.079 --> 00:18:53.720
You can't take crooked paths, right?

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:57.079
They called you a porn streamer.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.720
That's not what I meant.

00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:07.079
What are you doing?

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.839
Slacking off.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.960
Still haven't found it.

00:19:11.319 --> 00:19:12.000
Slacking off again.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:12.920
I'm telling you—

00:19:13.079 --> 00:19:14.319
If you don't find it, I'll dock your pay.

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:17.039
You only said I'd get a bonus if I found it.

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.400
You never said you'd dock my pay if I didn't.

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:20.480
Well, who told you to not meet your KFC?

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.359
You mean performance targets, right?

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:24.720
That's what I meant.

00:19:25.119 --> 00:19:25.599
Just think about it.

00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:27.000
How long have you been at the store?

00:19:27.079 --> 00:19:28.799
You haven't created any value.

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:29.799
You're getting paid for nothing.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.160
Hurry up and look.

00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:32.680
I'm counting on that five hundred thousand to save me.

00:19:33.319 --> 00:19:34.400
Uncle Meng, what's wrong?

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.319
Cancer?

00:19:36.359 --> 00:19:36.960
Ptooey, ptooey, ptooey!

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.160
Touch wood, touch wood.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.720
How is your imagination so wild?

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:40.119
Enough.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:41.839
Go, hurry up and get moving.

00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:43.200
Go, go, go! Move, move!

00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:43.799
Hurry up and look.

00:19:49.279 --> 00:19:49.839
Dad

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:51.200
Let me say this,

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.039
don't put too much pressure on Li Cai.

00:19:54.039 --> 00:19:54.720
As the old saying goes,

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.039
don't try to squeeze blood from a stone.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.680
Isn't your mother-in-law squeezing me dry?

00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:01.720
This crappy account with over one thousand fans,

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.400
they keep chasing me for compensation every day.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.759
They even chased me all the way to the senior college.

00:20:05.319 --> 00:20:07.279
Now, I can't perform at the college party.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.720
They call me a tainted celebrity.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.759
At school,

00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:10.519
they limit my spending.

00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:12.279
I can't order any dish over one yuan.

00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:13.240
Your mom said

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.519
each fan is worth twenty yuan.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.599
I had to pay her twenty thousand yuan

00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:16.599
just to get me out of

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.279
the blacklist for untrustworthy people.

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:20.000
No way,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.720
my mom

00:20:20.839 --> 00:20:22.039
isn't that too much?

00:20:22.039 --> 00:20:22.680
Exactly.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.279
How about this,

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:25.960
let's make a new account.

00:20:26.319 --> 00:20:27.240
We'll livestream together.

00:20:27.279 --> 00:20:28.240
Let's earn the money back.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.680
Is it hard to make a new account?

00:20:31.119 --> 00:20:32.000
Not at all.

00:20:32.079 --> 00:20:33.000
Right.

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.839
Even my mom

00:20:34.839 --> 00:20:36.359
can get over one thousand fans.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.000
Why can't the three of us do it?

00:20:38.519 --> 00:20:39.880
Yeah.

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:41.200
Exactly.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.519
Of course.

00:20:42.599 --> 00:20:43.880
Let's do it, do it, do it.

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:45.599
Do it.

00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:45.880
Hurry up.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.720
Do it, make one.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.240
What's missing?

00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:54.240
It's been all morning.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.160
Not a single person showed up.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.880
There was one person.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.359
Didn't you kick them out?

00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:00.039
They called me an old fool.

00:21:00.039 --> 00:21:00.960
How could I not kick them?

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.839
So rude.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.400
It's fine.

00:21:03.599 --> 00:21:05.440
Keep going. Persistence is victory.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.440
If we work hard, we'll get results.

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:11.279
Look,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.400
here comes one.

00:21:13.079 --> 00:21:15.200
Buy weight loss pills, add QQ number.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.960
That's just

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.559
a bot spamming ads.

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:21.519
Then kick it out quickly.

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:22.359
No, no, no.

00:21:22.359 --> 00:21:23.440
Don't kick, keep it.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.359
Even a bot is better than no one.

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:28.599
That reminds me.

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.839
Why don't we use avatars to livestream?

00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:32.279
What do you mean?

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:33.400
That's popular now.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.279
You put two scarecrows in your shop,

00:21:35.759 --> 00:21:36.400
just standing there.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.839
Not scarecrows.

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:38.720
They're called

00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:40.400
VTubers.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.240
It's still us livestreaming,

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.160
but viewers see cartoon avatars.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.680
That, that...

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.200
I've experienced that before.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.480
Dad, I think it's a good idea.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.400
The few of us

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.160
can dress up as little animals.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.400
Doesn't that fit

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.680
the pet shop theme perfectly?

00:21:58.039 --> 00:21:58.599
Really?

00:21:59.039 --> 00:21:59.480
Alright.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.119
Let's try.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.000
Let's give it a shot.

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:07.519
I'm the fish.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.240
You're Benbo'erba.

00:22:09.519 --> 00:22:10.480
Then who's Baboberben?

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.000
Who is that?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.519
Me, I'm Baboberben.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:14.640
Uh...

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.000
What am I?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.319
You're a screwdriver.

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:19.839
No way,

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:22.519
weren't we supposed to be animals?

00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:25.680
It auto-generated, I don't know how to fix it.

00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:28.319
Say something, say something.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.960
Look, the screwdriver is talking.

00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:37.839
Come out.

00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:39.480
I know you're there.

00:22:43.119 --> 00:22:44.640
I can feel your emotions.

00:22:48.519 --> 00:22:49.200
Do you know

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.960
how much effort I put in

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.480
just to find you?

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.160
I crossed mountains and rivers.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.000
Sympathy.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.799
Why are you sympathizing with me?

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.480
Without me,

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.279
you'd spend your whole life

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:03.039
as a stray dog digging through trash.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:05.960
What?

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:07.200
You love digging through trash

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.960
because you like junk food.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.000
I like it too.

00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:12.400
By the way,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.599
where's your owner?

00:23:13.839 --> 00:23:14.720
Does she usually

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.200
let you eat junk food?

00:23:23.599 --> 00:23:24.400
I get it now.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.519
In human society,

00:23:26.599 --> 00:23:27.839
you feel restricted.

00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:29.680
Getting your fur styled and wearing clothes

00:23:30.079 --> 00:23:31.440
aren't natural for you.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.039
I'll give you freedom.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:41.960
Go on.

00:24:10.319 --> 00:24:11.160
That's nice.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.000
It used to be three people

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.359
standing here like fools.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720
Now it's three

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:16.920
monsters

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.079
standing here like fools.

00:24:18.839 --> 00:24:19.599
Don't lose hope.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.720
I just spent some money.

00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:22.960
Bought some traffic.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.880
We'll have viewers soon.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.440
Don't just stand here.

00:24:30.319 --> 00:24:31.400
Sing a song or something.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.920
Liven up the atmosphere.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.079
Sell cat food.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.799
Sell cat food.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.880
This Livey Room has no traffic.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.720
We can't keep our business going.

00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:52.400
Cat food, cat food, sell cat food.

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:54.160
Dad,

00:24:55.039 --> 00:24:56.920
sing something a bit more upbeat.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.400
I'm already singing with a smile.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.480
Isn't that cheerful enough?

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:06.440
Someone actually placed an order.

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:08.519
Thank you.

00:25:08.839 --> 00:25:10.599
Thanks to the user named

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.720
"Universe's Greatest Demon King."

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.960
Thank you, thank you so much.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.119
Thanks.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.680
Placed five hundred orders.

00:25:19.079 --> 00:25:20.400
Heh heh heh.

00:25:20.759 --> 00:25:22.599
The stock, all the stock is gone.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:23.680
Uh...

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.200
Thank you, thank you.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.680
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.440
You're our lifesaver.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.079
Thank you.

00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:31.400
I told you so.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.240
This is easy, simple.

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:35.759
Your mother-in-law is making a fuss.

00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:39.000
Wait, hold on.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:40.960
Why did you turn it off?

00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:43.200
The money's off, this account...

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:44.960
We've only got a little over four thousand.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.039
Darn it.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.440
Darn it, darn it.

00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:52.079
When you listed the product,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.640
you added an extra decimal point.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.839
Cat food, ninety-nine per bag,

00:25:54.839 --> 00:25:56.039
was sold for nine point nine.

00:25:58.039 --> 00:25:58.559
Uh...

00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:00.680
Dad.

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:01.240
Dad.

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:01.839
Dad.

00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:04.039
Dad.

00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:05.240
Hurry.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.680
Should we call 120?

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.880
Call!

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:14.839
Wu An.

00:26:15.319 --> 00:26:15.640
Done.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.000
The money for stock came from my buddies.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.440
They pooled it for my album.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.359
How do I explain this?

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.319
I contacted that buyer.

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:28.599
He said if we don't ship,

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.799
he'll report us for false advertising.

00:26:32.119 --> 00:26:32.880
Then,

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.319
our shop's deposit will be withheld,

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.359
and we'll get fined.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.599
The loss will be even bigger.

00:26:38.119 --> 00:26:39.200
Give me his address.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.720
I'll go talk to him in person.

00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:42.720
It's useless.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.079
He left a roadside

00:26:45.079 --> 00:26:46.279
delivery station address.

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:47.640
He doesn't want us to find him.

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:50.200
We...

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.759
ran into a professional claim hunter.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.240
You paid for traffic,

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.200
and brought in bad luck.

00:26:56.799 --> 00:26:58.759
Wait, how is this all my fault?

00:26:59.119 --> 00:27:01.160
I just wanted to sell more.

00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:03.200
If not for...

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.440
Yeah.

00:27:08.279 --> 00:27:10.039
If I hadn't messed up the price,

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:11.559
it wouldn't be like this.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.839
It's all my fault, Dad.

00:27:13.839 --> 00:27:14.440
This...

00:27:15.079 --> 00:27:16.160
Your loss,

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.160
I'll take responsibility.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.640
How can I let you bear it alone?

00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:21.160
I share the blame too.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.079
Dad.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.799
Li Li and I will

00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:25.200
make up the money for you.

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:27.160
Uh...

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.359
These two kids...

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.119
Really...

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.119
You have such a good heart.

00:27:31.119 --> 00:27:33.079
I'm already very happy.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.279
And the second half?

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.599
If you really give me the money,

00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:40.799
I'll be

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.000
even happier.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.920
Why are you acting so high and mighty?

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.319
Then this,

00:27:47.319 --> 00:27:49.599
shouldn't you take responsibility?

00:27:49.799 --> 00:27:51.319
How can a retired old man handle this?

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.119
You're a forced-out old man,

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.119
without even a pension.

00:27:55.839 --> 00:27:56.519
No, this...

00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:57.960
It's their responsibility.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.720
Doesn't that bother your conscience?

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.200
Weren't those two doing it for you?

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.519
That's why they took it on.

00:28:02.599 --> 00:28:03.240
Wasn't it for you

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.119
that they did all this?

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.480
If you didn't hound me for money daily,

00:28:05.599 --> 00:28:07.279
would we rush into livestreaming?

00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:08.160
Mistakes happen when you're busy.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.559
How can you blame me?

00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:10.519
Who else should I blame?

00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:11.640
Are you being reasonable?

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.480
How am I not reasonable?

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.519
Stop, quit arguing.

00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:17.400
About this...

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.720
Li Li and I will figure it out.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.880
Collector's edition.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.519
Signed guitar.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.519
Selling with tears.

00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:54.599
Dear friends,

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.039
Don't miss out as you pass by.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.279
Let's not talk about all the signatures yet.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.079
Let's talk about the year.

00:29:02.519 --> 00:29:03.559
A guitar from eighty-three.

00:29:03.799 --> 00:29:05.440
Think how much wine from eighty-three costs.

00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:06.720
This guitar of mine,

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.000
is this price really expensive?

00:29:08.119 --> 00:29:09.720
Let's talk about this signature.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:10.720
This one,

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.359
this is

00:29:18.279 --> 00:29:19.119
Cui Jian.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.519
His brother,

00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:21.920
Cui Kang.

00:29:22.599 --> 00:29:24.240
Cui Kang's autograph.

00:29:29.839 --> 00:29:31.400
Didn't you say this kind of livestream

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.240
was super popular?

00:29:33.319 --> 00:29:35.359
We need two hundred more gifts to end.

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:36.880
Now we don't even have two gifts.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.599
We'll be streaming until next year at this rate.

00:29:39.519 --> 00:29:41.480
Stop blaming me.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.039
Why not warm up while you wait?

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.720
Someone might send gifts any minute.

00:29:46.839 --> 00:29:47.880
Warm up? Seriously?

00:29:48.519 --> 00:29:49.880
Wearing this feels like an oven.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.319
I'm almost cooked.

00:29:52.279 --> 00:29:53.000
There are big names too.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.759
Michael

00:29:54.039 --> 00:29:54.759
Jackson

00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:55.759
Grammy Awards

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.279
During the performance,

00:29:57.559 --> 00:29:59.519
sixth row, center spot, backup dancer.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.920
Julio Diaz

00:30:01.039 --> 00:30:01.960
autographed it himself.

00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:02.480
Look.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.920
He Wu Hu

00:30:05.799 --> 00:30:07.359
Thanks to "See You Never Again"

00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:09.359
for sending nine hundred ninety-nine glow sticks.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.480
See?

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.079
Told you someone would send gifts.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.200
Come on, hurry up!

00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:13.680
Come.

00:30:14.039 --> 00:30:14.640
All right.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.359
Start running.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.599
Thank you!

00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:17.960
Thanks to "See You Never Again"

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:18.799
for the gifts.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.480
Thanks to "See You Never Again"

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.359
for the gifts.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.079
That's great!

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.079
Twenty thousand meters!

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:27.799
What's going on?

00:30:27.799 --> 00:30:28.359
How much?

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.279
Twenty thousand meters.

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:30.160
You've only run two meters.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:30.839
And you already stopped.

00:30:30.839 --> 00:30:31.680
That's a lot.

00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:33.039
It's fine.

00:30:33.359 --> 00:30:34.720
The more you run, the more you earn.

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:35.519
Keep going!

00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:38.720
This guitar is very precious.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.400
Do you think I'm selling it for too much?

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:41.319
Is it expensive?

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.319
Let me put it this way.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.759
When I was young,

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.799
I carried this guitar

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:45.559
and my son

00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:47.119
riding a bike down the road.

00:30:47.319 --> 00:30:48.799
One manhole cover wasn't closed.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.240
Bang!

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.039
We fell right in.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.559
I grabbed the guitar first,

00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:53.480
then pulled out my son.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:54.920
So tell me,

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:55.960
this guitar—

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.960
I sell it for twenty thousand yuan.

00:30:57.279 --> 00:30:57.839
Is that expensive?

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.240
Hand on your heart,

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.319
ask yourself honestly.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.319
Is it expensive?

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.960
It's sold.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.240
Sold it too cheap.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.400
Hang Hang,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.160
you don't need to send me the money.

00:31:27.319 --> 00:31:28.839
I've covered the album costs.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:31.720
Dad,

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.400
your

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.799
limited edition guitar—

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.519
did you sell it?

00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:39.599
It's fine.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.680
Let's not talk about the guitar.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.920
Don't be like that, Dad.

00:31:43.599 --> 00:31:46.039
Meng Hang and I have a solution.

00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:47.480
He'll run a few more marathons.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.720
We'll have enough money.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:49.720
That's right.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.440
It's okay.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.759
Just talk to the buyer.

00:31:52.039 --> 00:31:53.160
Buy the guitar back.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:53.920
No need, no need.

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:54.519
Really, it's fine.

00:31:54.519 --> 00:31:55.599
That's my own problem.

00:31:55.599 --> 00:31:56.960
I can't let you pay for it.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.079
It's just a guitar.

00:31:58.119 --> 00:31:58.559
It's okay.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.079
No need.

00:32:00.119 --> 00:32:00.559
Dad.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.119
This kid...

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.079
Not all parents

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.920
are indifferent to their children.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.759
Li Cai,

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.839
come out.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:17.759
I'm here.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.279
Where's the stuff?

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.480
I forgot.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:22.960
Look at me...

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.440
You should've told me.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.319
Why did you come out?

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.160
I guessed it—

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.000
Old Meng wants to play the good guy.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.640
If he sold the guitar,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.480
he'd

00:32:44.599 --> 00:32:45.960
definitely make me look bad.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.640
I can't give him that chance.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.240
So Aunt Cai bought it ahead of time.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.400
She sent it to me.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:53.839
Uncle Meng,

00:32:54.119 --> 00:32:55.440
my mom's amazing.

00:32:56.319 --> 00:32:57.359
You bought it?

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.559
And you two should quit that crappy livestream.

00:33:08.759 --> 00:33:09.440
No one's watching.

00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:10.319
How is no one watching?

00:33:10.319 --> 00:33:12.440
I sent all nine thousand flowers.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.680
So you're

00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:16.039
"See You Never Again"?

00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:17.799
See?

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.519
I knew you were just pretending.

00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:22.039
When it matters,

00:33:22.359 --> 00:33:23.480
you really care about us.

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:24.599
You help us through tough times.

00:33:24.839 --> 00:33:25.319
No way.

00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:27.039
I just like watching him run.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.359
There's a blogger who gets a heart

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.000
for every hundred meters he runs.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.000
I sent him gifts all the way to Shanhaiguan.

00:33:34.319 --> 00:33:35.720
That's intense.

00:33:35.799 --> 00:33:36.519
Give me back the guitar.

00:33:37.119 --> 00:33:38.000
So cute, so cute.

00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:39.039
Adorable!

00:33:39.799 --> 00:33:41.359
Uncle Meng, you're happy too soon.

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:42.839
There's something even happier outside.

00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:44.599
What a great day.

00:33:44.759 --> 00:33:45.920
Full of surprises.

00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:47.079
Let's go.

00:33:53.799 --> 00:33:54.400
See?

00:33:56.119 --> 00:33:57.240
I scored a real bargain.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.359
This cat food

00:33:58.359 --> 00:34:00.440
I bought it online, nine yuan ninety per bag.

00:34:00.759 --> 00:34:01.799
Let's sell it.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.880
We'll definitely make money.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.559
What a shame.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.160
I couldn't find that account again.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.000
Otherwise, I'd have stocked up more.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.760
You bought it.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.480
I bought it.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.360
Dad.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:16.840
Uncle Meng.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.320
Dad.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.119
Uncle Meng.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:18.800
Dad.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.559
Told you so.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:20.920
There's something even happier.

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:22.199
Dad.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:30.840
Reportedly,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.199
the previous 500,000 yuan reward

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:33.719
offered by Ms. Liu for her lost dog

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.320
has finally led to her dog's return.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.639
The helpful citizen who found the dog,

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:38.320
Mr. Wang,

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.639
was interviewed

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:40.960
and couldn't stop laughing.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:41.800
Therefore,

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.960
our station couldn't further

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.639
learn about his feelings.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.239
That's a pity.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.400
What's so pitiful about that?

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:52.440
Like you'd just happen to find it.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:53.800
What?

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.239
If you don't pick something up, it's lost?

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:55.960
You don't get it.

00:34:56.079 --> 00:34:57.440
That's not what I regret.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.800
I should've let it run farther.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.400
Flamingos can live eighty years.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.280
Impressive, impressive, impressive.

00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:19.639
A thriving, lively family.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.679
Scan it.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.199
Didn't we already add each other on WeChat?

00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:26.280
That's the payment code.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.639
Your cat food debt is settled.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.480
Pay me back for the guitar.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.800
No, I thought that was

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.360
a little peace offering between us.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.079
Who said we're making peace?

00:35:35.639 --> 00:35:36.320
Well, how about this—

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.480
If Cai Cai finds the dog,

00:35:37.519 --> 00:35:38.719
I'll give you a bigger cut.

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:41.079
Cai Cai, stop scrolling.

00:35:41.559 --> 00:35:42.840
Go look for the dog now.

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:44.159
Didn't they already find the dog?

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.280
Then let me check quickly

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.719
if anyone else lost a dog.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.639
I didn't see anyone else lose a dog.

00:35:51.719 --> 00:35:52.800
I just saw people losing face.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.440
Hurry, scan it.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.559
Losing face, gotta find it fast.

00:35:54.559 --> 00:35:55.079
Find it, get paid.

00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:55.639
You...

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:58.960
First of all,

00:35:59.039 --> 00:36:00.880
about you being brought back,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.880
I express my regret.

00:36:02.519 --> 00:36:04.039
But could you share

00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:06.679
your core thoughts on longing for freedom?

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.000
Regret, my ass!

00:36:08.239 --> 00:36:10.320
I nearly starved those two days on the street.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.119
Good thing someone brought me back.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.400
But Li Cai said

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.679
you want a free, unrestrained life.

00:36:17.039 --> 00:36:17.760
No.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.559
Don't you post moody stuff at midnight?

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.519
Share some music,

00:36:21.519 --> 00:36:23.440
say you want to escape this world.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.639
Then delete it the next day.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.920
Who takes that seriously?

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.719
I was just being poetic.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.800
But this fool took off my collar.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.119
I almost got locked up as a stray dog.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.119
Stop the interview. I'll count to three.
