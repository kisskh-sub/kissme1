Eunuch Li

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.680
Your Majesty

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.600
Lord Rui

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.000
His Majesty is busy right now

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.920
Please come back another day

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.640
I'm not going in

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.120
But the memorial

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.200
Please, Eunuch, deliver it for me

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.920
Lord Rui

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.240
I'm not making things difficult for you

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.760
Recently, generals keep getting into trouble

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.760
Right now

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.800
His Majesty is discussing this with
Left Minister and Minister Ming

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.040
Lord Rui is related to the generals

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.360
It's best to avoid suspicion

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.400
I understand

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.480
The memorial

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.280
Please deliver it for me, Eunuch

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.920
Your Majesty

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.240
Lord Rui

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.920
He left after submitting the memorial

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.120
Just leave it there

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.560
Yes

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.560
General Qian

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.920
He harassed a fisherwoman

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.960
and killed her in public

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.160
General Qiao secretly lent usury

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.720
These are serious crimes in our dynasty

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.280
Lord Rui is related to the generals

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.480
It's inevitable

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.200
Concern clouds judgment

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.920
Generals committing crimes is a grave matter

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.240
I wonder

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.640
what the two chief judges of this case

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.200
think about it

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.600
I

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.840
will thoroughly investigate both cases

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.200
and allow no mistakes

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.880
I believe

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.320
we should choose someone for this case

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.800
who has no connections at all

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.920
Left Minister

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.680
What do you mean by that?

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.440
Minister Ming

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.200
once oversaw the exile of generals

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.720
If he judges this case again

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.880
it might easily

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.520
cause controversy

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.200
Left Minister makes sense

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.600
This case does need further discussion

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.320
How about this

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.240
Left Minister

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.200
Go back

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.040
and draft a list of suitable candidates

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.240
Submit a memorial

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.000
Yes

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.200
Then I shall take my leave

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.560
I take my leave

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.440
Don't panic

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.880
Rui Yu has already entered the palace

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.880
Father's health is poor, how can I not worry?

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.400
Junior

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.840
Why do others lend usury

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.040
and just wait at home to be summoned

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.800
but my father was thrown straight into jail

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.800
And Uncle Qian

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.080
He may be quick-tempered

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.640
but how could he kill someone in public?

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.840
He Zhaoyin made the arrests

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.520
He's from Minister Ming's faction

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.920
They don't care about generals' explanations

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.240
Father

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.880
We can't rely too much on Rui Yu

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.560
He's fighting the whole court alone

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.000
It's hard for him

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.520
I understand

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.960
I'll also go out to gather news and find a way

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.640
But the palace's stance

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.240
won't be clear until Rui Yu returns

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.440
My lord has returned

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.280
He went with Left Minister

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.680
to Piyun Pavilion together

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.080
Let's go too

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.760
Before Rui Yu returns

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.600
let's wait

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.040
It's been a long time since I visited you

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.360
Please forgive me, Teacher

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.400
Hanlin Academy affairs are busy

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.920
You've devoted your mind

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.400
entirely to official duties

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.000
That's a good thing

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.760
I still remember when I first entered office

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.160
Your every word of advice

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.200
led me to today's achievements

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.960
Enough

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.320
No need for formalities between us

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.920
You're worried about those generals

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.400
so you hurriedly

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.240
invited me here, right?

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.120
You see through me, Teacher

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.680
General Qiao and General Qian

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.760
are not criminals

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.360
You should not get involved

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.080
His Majesty refused you in the palace

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.400
That shows his stance

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.080
You must avoid suspicion

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.360
I understand

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.800
But I

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.760
don't want to be the chief judge

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.040
I want to recommend someone

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.000
My lord, please

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.760
Did Lord Rui invite me for good food

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.720
or good wine?

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.720
This humble official

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.920
greets Left Minister

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.520
Lord Rui

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.720
Teacher

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.920
This is the Hanlin Academy scholar

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.000
Liu Zhi

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.840
I wish to recommend him

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.760
as the chief judge for this case

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.760
Lord Liu is sharp and wise

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.680
and never joins factional disputes

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.520
His family has no ties to the generals

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.200
He's the best candidate

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.000
He's close to you

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.280
That's not appropriate

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.240
Anyone can be close to Lord Liu

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.560
I'm no exception

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.440
Reporting to Left Minister

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.560
Perhaps it's because I

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.520
can't compete or snatch anything

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.520
so

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.800
all the lords

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.720
are willing to speak with me more

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.560
So, in that case

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.120
you're rather sly

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.040
neither close nor distant

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.760
so you have no ties or burdens

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.960
In this regard

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.600
you should learn from Lord Liu

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.360
I understand

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.680
Though I dislike rash warriors

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.800
when handling cases

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.440
one must be fair

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.520
If it's found these two

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.360
are truly innocent

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.840
I

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.360
will report to Your Majesty myself

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.360
Tomorrow, I'll submit a memorial

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.640
I

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.320
will have Your Majesty

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.240
take note of Liu Zhi

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.160
Thank you, Left Minister

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.520
You are trusted by Your Majesty

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.200
Remember

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.320
do not be impatient or irritable

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.720
so as not to

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.840
give others something to use against you

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.640
I will keep that in mind

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.640
Why isn't he back yet?

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.000
He's so slow gathering news

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.880
Even the street vendors are faster

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.440
Princess

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.080
Wanwan

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.880
Why are you in such a hurry to go?

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.320
Did you just come from the Empress Dowager's palace?

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.520
What is the Empress Dowager doing now?

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.600
She just took her medicine

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.640
and is now resting

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.280
You come to the palace daily to care for her

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.280
You've worked hard

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.640
The Empress Dowager treats me kindly

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.200
It's what I ought to do

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.480
Princess

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.840
Your Majesty summoned Left Minister and Minister Liu

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.280
to discuss disaster relief

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.000
They likely won't leave the Hall of Diligence today

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.160
So that means

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.440
no one's watching me

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:10.920
Yes

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.840
I'm going back to change clothes

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:15.960
Princess

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.800
You're not sneaking out of the palace, are you?

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.080
It's been half a month since I returned from Pingxiang

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.240
I've been staying obediently in the palace every day

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.000
I'm really bored to death

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.240
Wanwan

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.600
You must keep this secret for me

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.720
If my brother or mother asks you, just say

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.280
just say

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.280
whatever comes to mind

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.920
Princess

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.000
Don't follow me

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.280
Yu'er knows how to handle things

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.240
Chen Xiao

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.440
is also good at strategy

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.160
You can safely return to Qiemo

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.160
I've

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.760
caused you trouble

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.320
Not at all

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.840
Thanks to you

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.120
they returned safely

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.600
But now

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.680
the situation is unstable

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.800
if you stay in Ling An

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.280
it may not be safe

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.840
Then I'll

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.040
return to Qiemo first

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.600
and wait for Brother Rui

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.960
and news from Young Master Nan

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.480
Take care

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.160
Take care

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.720
Master

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.960
None of us can help Yu'er

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.160
In three days

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.800
a group of beggar children will be sent out of the city

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.600
Which gate will they use?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.720
Most likely Xihua Gate

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.880
The guards there

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.520
are close with Minister Ming

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.480
You've investigated for days

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.640
and only saw Minister Ming's steward

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.400
taking money from the broker

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.120
They can still deny everything

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.000
If we act rashly

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.840
we'll alert them for sure

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.200
If we don't act

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.680
it'll be hard to find those

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.800
beggar children after they're sold

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.120
Minister Ming

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.320
He visited our home before

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.880
looking for Father and Yu'er

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.960
hoping to use the Spring Imperial Examination

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.120
to cultivate his own faction

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.560
He always advocates suppressing the generals

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.240
The case of General Qiao and General Qian

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.600
must be connected to him

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.480
Have the provincial examinations ended everywhere?

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.440
If you count the days

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.280
Yes, they've all ended

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.240
Keep a close watch

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.640
Send any news about the exams back immediately

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.880
Since the beggar children case leads nowhere

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.120
we'll have to try another approach

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.600
Rescue them tonight

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.760
Wait for the right moment

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.400
Yes, Master

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.680
I'll handle it right away

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.920
Lord Liu

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.520
My dear Lord Rui

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.120
You called me here for such a big matter

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.800
and you didn't even

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.640
give me any warning

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.760
So

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.960
you don't want to take this job?

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.440
I'm used to a leisurely life

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:48.920
Besides

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.080
I'm just an unknown general and scholar

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.080
What can I really do?

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:55.840
Speaking of which

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.200
I've never understood this about you

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.400
You're clearly very capable

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.520
Why hide your talent behind modesty?

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.120
Me

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.800
I come from a humble family

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.000
I only sought success

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.640
so my family wouldn't be bullied anymore

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.920
But after receiving an official post

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.240
I felt the court was even more chaotic

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.640
I don't want to get involved

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.320
I'd rather be a clean Hanlin scholar

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.720
and live peacefully

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.560
That's good enough

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:33.880
You

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.280
Why are you so calm about this?

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:37.960
Don't you have

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.080
anything to ask me, or to argue back?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.960
If you truly just want to protect yourself,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.240
just now,

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.280
you could've refused in front of the teacher.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.680
But you didn't do that.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.080
I...

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.280
Let me guess.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.560
You're not afraid of getting involved.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.920
You're just worried

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.400
that the Liu family

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.640
has no power or influence.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.480
You serve the country,

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.040
eliminate traitors,

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.280
but fear your family will be implicated.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.000
Yes.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.120
I can't let my family get dragged in.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.800
But I don't want to pick a side either.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.120
Whether it's civil officials

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.120
or military generals,

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.840
for a nation to prosper,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:17.800
both civil and military

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.280
are indispensable.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.880
Why must we take sides?

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.360
If you have ambition,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.520
you can give it your all

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.080
to balance civil and military power.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.360
Yes.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.640
But if I do that,

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.120
my family members,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.160
they...

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.200
I, Rui Yu, am not talented,

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.760
but now,

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.400
I'm only second rank.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.640
Still,

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.600
I have some reputation at court.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.840
If you're willing,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.640
I'm willing to shelter you.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.280
Let's accomplish this together.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.960
Only second rank...

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.280
Only you,

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.600
Lord Rui, would dare say that.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:02.840
Lord Rui,

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.280
Since I've accepted this task,

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.600
I'll give it my all.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.880
What's this?

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.360
What is this thing?

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.720
Red bean buns, pork buns.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.720
Bun shop.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.640
Fresh pork buns!

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.960
Come and take a look!

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.400
That sly fox said once,

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.960
What did he say again?

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.320
Fengdong Bun Shop's red bean buns are the best.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.120
Let's buy some as a gift.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.720
Here, for you.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.000
Hold it tight.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.400
Here.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.360
Thank you.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.680
Kid.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.280
Boss.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.920
Give me a basket of red bean buns.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.440
Miss,

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.200
what a pity.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.520
The last basket of buns

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.240
was bought by this little girl.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.640
Smells so good.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.840
When will the next batch be ready?

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.200
At least the time it takes to burn one incense stick.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.160
One incense stick...

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:25.840
This...

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.280
Smells amazing.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.280
Little one,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.880
can you

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.880
share with me,

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.200
two red bean buns?

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.040
Sure.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.960
Trade for sticky rice cake.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.840
Sticky rice cake?

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.480
Yes.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.280
This...

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.800
Where do I buy sticky rice cake?

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.360
You don't know that?

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.200
Come with me.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:47.840
Let's go.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:00.760
Go.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.160
Hurry up.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.360
Behave.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.000
What did you bring back?

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.360
Just a few days ago,

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.600
didn't someone die of illness?

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.200
With less stock,

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.400
we won't have enough silver.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.600
Guess what?

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.840
On the street,

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.760
I ran into two girls.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.360
No one was with them.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.480
They looked pretty fresh.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.480
So I just

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.080
grabbed them and brought them back.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.840
Untie them quickly.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.080
Don't suffocate them.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:55.880
Open up.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.960
Why is there no movement?

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.280
Nothing happened, right?

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.520
These two girls

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.040
are tough.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.280
Look, she bit me.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.520
So I gave them

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.520
some knockout powder.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.480
It's fine.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.600
You can tell these two

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.920
are spoiled.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.600
You must've kidnapped some official's daughter.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.520
With so many of us,

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.920
we'd all lose our heads.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.200
No way.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.280
Look,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.600
this one,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:43.920
is still wearing

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.360
maid's clothes.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.800
It's me, it's me.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.000
Second Brother!

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.080
Why are you here?

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.200
I just saw two little girls

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.760
a man was carrying them this way.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.040
They must've been taken to that courtyard.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.000
That courtyard has kidnapped many beggar children.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.000
Tonight they'll be sent out of the city to be sold.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.720
Are you sure?

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.160
Then let's act quickly!

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.480
Don't rush.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.960
Their goal is to sell the children.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.360
So before leaving the city,

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.560
the girls should be safe.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.360
My people

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.960
are already surrounding the area.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.680
I guess these people

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.240
will leave at dusk when vendors pack up.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.640
We'll strike during the chaos.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.920
It won't cause a commotion.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.480
So dizzy...

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.160
Awake.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.040
Sirs,

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.480
you must be exhausted too.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.120
How about

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.560
I take you to the best restaurant for a meal?

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.520
You’re just a lowly maid.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.120
How many coins could you possibly have?

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.440
I...

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.880
I suddenly...

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.560
My stomach suddenly hurts so much.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.840
Please, sirs, I beg you—

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.640
Take me to see a doctor, please!

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.440
Hold it in.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.560
To be honest with you all,

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.040
I’ve been sickly since I was little.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.280
Just the other day, I caught tuberculosis.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:38.520
Boss,

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.120
she just bit me!

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.440
I won’t catch anything, will I?

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:41.960
Boss...

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.840
No, let’s get a doctor.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:44.960
Don’t believe her.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.440
This girl looks perfectly healthy.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.720
She doesn’t look at all

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.600
like a maid who does hard labor.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.800
Besides, the order from above is enough people.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.120
As for who those people are,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.080
their quality doesn’t matter.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400
That’s not our concern.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.320
Fine.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.360
You—

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.200
go find Steward Ming.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.520
Explain this whole thing

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.560
clearly to him.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.920
See if they

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.680
want to keep or release her.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:16.720
Yes.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.360
Everyone heard that, right?

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.760
If there’s no word from above,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.560
during this time,

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.000
no one is allowed to harm her.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.240
Not even a single hair can be touched.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.560
Is that clear?

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.320
Didn’t expect it, Second Brother—

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.240
you have people everywhere.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.520
Let’s stick to the plan.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.320
We move at dusk.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:03.280
Alright.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.880
Help!

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.200
Help!

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.200
Shut up!

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.440
That voice...

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.640
Princess! Princess!

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.720
What are you staring at?

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.400
Go!

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.480
Beat her up!

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.560
Don’t come any closer!

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.200
I’m the sister of Liu Zhi, Second-Rank Scholar of the Hanlin Academy!

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.960
He’s a favorite at court right now.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.120
If you dare lay a hand on us,

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.360
watch your heads!

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.360
Scholar Rui...

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.360
has a sister?

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.160
The Rui family is just three brothers.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.600
No girls.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.200
So she’s making it up?

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:40.960
Miss Rui,

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.920
it’s not that we won’t let you go,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:43.920
but you—

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.560
words alone aren’t proof.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.480
I...

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.960
Just you wait!

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.800
This is the token my brother Yu gave me!

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.800
It’s a real palace token!

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.240
We’re in big trouble now.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.240
What’s wrong?

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.800
Once she gets back,

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.360
the Rui family will definitely report us.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.160
Then we’ll all be in deep trouble.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.000
Why don’t we, while she’s—

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.560
before the Rui family finds out,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.760
get rid of her.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:20.840
Alright.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.760
Don’t come over! Stay back!

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.040
Stop!

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.600
Princess!

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.600
Are you alright?

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.440
Bad Fox, why did you only just get here?

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.400
I was scared to death!

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.280
It’s okay now, it’s okay.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.120
Why is Hanzhen here too?

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.200
Uncle Rui!

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:00.840
Don’t be afraid.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.880
You’re safe now.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.480
You’re from Wurong.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.680
Master! Master! Master!

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.200
I’ve already finished here and you’re just arriving.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.600
Isn’t that embarrassing?

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.520
Take these people

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.760
to the authorities and hand them to Yu’er.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:32.600
Yes.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:34.760
Bad Fox!

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.400
Let’s go.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:36.560
Go.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.080
Get up.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:38.880
Let’s go, Princess.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:39.960
I’ll escort you back to the palace.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.960
Will you come back to the palace with me?

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.360
We’re on the same side.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.000
Hurry and take them back.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:49.800
Yes.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:52.720
Go.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:53.600
Go through the children’s gate.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.200
Let’s go, little sister.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.600
Slow down.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.440
Go.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.080
Go see my royal brother.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.840
Otherwise, my brother will scold me.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.120
Let’s go together.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.800
Alright, alright.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:06.920
Let’s go.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:08.880
Come.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.760
But—

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.440
I need to take my niece back first.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.320
Niece.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:17.960
Be good.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.800
She got separated from her parents.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.720
I’ll take you to the authorities soon.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.880
They’ll help you find your parents.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.520
Stop!

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.920
Lord Liu!

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.120
What do you mean?

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.880
Handle the case impartially.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:02.880
Please,

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.360
Minister Ming, cooperate.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.320
Search for me!

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:10.960
Yes.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.600
Sir.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.200
Go.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.320
It’s alright.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.760
We should trust Father.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.480
Search for me!

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.240
Yes.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.160
Really...

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.240
What a clever move.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:58.880
Stop!

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.400
Stop!
