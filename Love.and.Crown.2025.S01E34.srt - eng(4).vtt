[Love & Crown]

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.980
[Adapted from the novel "My Queen" by Xie Lounan]

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.980
[Episode 34]

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.460
You think that beating me

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.100
means you can rule the Lingbi Sect?

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.180
You're celebrating way too soon.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.930
On the night of the full moon,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.460
the Ghost King returns to his tomb.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.770
If you want to end this before then,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.460
you'll have to kill me!

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.820
Guards!

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.010
Lock her up.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.220
Keep her under strict watch!

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.850
Understood!

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.730
Zhong... Zhong Lin?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.220
Xiao Qianqing,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.410
things have come to a point

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.130
that's far worse than we ever imagined.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.170
This is Aunt Chan's written confession.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.850
She blamed Princess Ying's death on Du Tingxin,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.340
not the emperor.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.690
Because of that, everyone from Xuanguang Hall was hunted down.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.980
After Mother's funeral,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.130
all the maids in Xuanguang Hall

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.260
were dismissed.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.570
I sent men to look into it.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.730
Those maids all died mysteriously,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.780
only Aunt Chan disappeared without a trace.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.260
She must have been poisoned and fled.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.540
But the poison still took her life.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.890
I found this letter on her body.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.580
The last witness is gone,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.530
gone!

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.810
There's also a eulogy

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.260
the Empress Dowager wrote for Princess Ying.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.460
[I'll repay you in the next life.]

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.060
[The tenth day of the second month in the ninth year of Yongxi]

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.900
The tenth day of the second month...

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.530
That was the day before Ying died.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.410
When Ying was still alive,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.770
why was Mother already mourning her?

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.970
Zhong Lin,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.140
the only explanation

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.820
is that Mother knew Ying would die

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.770
and that she was involved.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.730
No, that can't be...

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.060
She raised Ying herself.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.460
She...

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.850
she could never kill her.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.620
Right?

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.580
Then...

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.410
why did Mother kill herself?

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.530
Was it really just to force me into rebellion?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.900
Your imperial brother

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.170
tortured Princess Ying to death

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.380
and drove the Empress Dowager to suicide.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.700
I choose

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.260
to back Your Highness for the throne.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.060
Du...

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.210
Ting...

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.900
Xin!

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.090
So Your Highness had been wary

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.700
of me all along.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.970
Tell me the truth.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.940
Did you

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.090
push my mother to kill Ying?

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.410
You already have all the evidence.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.530
Can you really not put it together?

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.060
Then let me tell you.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.770
Xiao Huan drew the poisonous insect out of Xiao Ying.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.580
Your mother then went to see Princess Ying off.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.770
Except...

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.210
she used Seven-Star Powder.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.650
Just a tiny dose of it was enough

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.730
to end her life.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.170
Mother...

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.090
- My head hurts. - So...

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.770
Ying!

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.140
...your mother

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.060
personally killed Xiao Ying.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:27.650
Impossible!

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.260
Basically, you have only yourself to blame.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.140
Born into the imperial family,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.820
yet always putting on that fake show of brotherly love.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.410
Naturally, your mother was angry.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.650
All her painstaking scheming

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.530
was only

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.580
to push you onto this throne.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.170
So...

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.140
you goaded the Empress Dowager into killing Princess Ying,

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.500
then pinned it all on the Emperor,

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.410
just to turn Prince of Yuzhang against him

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.410
and force him into rebellion.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.900
Du Tingxin,

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.530
what a vicious scheme!

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.940
You flatter me.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.460
That little three-birds-with-one-stone scheme

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.410
even I must say was quite brilliant.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.060
Watching you all

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.820
dance in the palm of my hand,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.410
that feeling

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.530
is simply delicious.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.730
Shut up.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.380
Shut up!

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.530
My mother might hate His Majesty,

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.530
but she'd never harm Ying.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.410
You're lying.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:39.730
You're lying!

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.580
Fine, I'll tell you another truth.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.020
At first, she and I planned a fake death.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.460
Unfortunately for her,

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.140
why would I give her the antidote?

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.650
Letting her pay for her own stupidity

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.260
is so much more fun.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.210
She wanted power in life and a good name after death.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.140
All I did

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.940
was help her fulfill that image

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.850
of a devoted mother!

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:09.460
You evil woman!

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.290
Xiao Qianqing,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.970
do you still think

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.210
you and Xiao Huan are innocent?

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.170
Xiao Huan can't even tell right from wrong.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.380
He'd rather trust outsiders

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.100
and throw away all the loyalty I gave him!

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.450
Empress Dowager Liu is even more despicable.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.170
I only dropped a few hints,

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.140
and she rushed over eagerly

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.930
to kill her own daughter!

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.810
As for Xiao Ying,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.020
blame her imperial birth,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.900
blame her ties to Xiao Huan and to you!

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.740
But she's lived as a princess long enough.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.380
That's hardly a wasted life.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.020
Early or late, she'll be dead anyway.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.770
I'm evil?

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.530
Why not blame your mother

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.450
for being ruthless and blinded by greed?

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.740
Du Tingxin,

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.810
Xiao Huan has always treated you as his right hand,

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.020
and he has never treated you badly.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.100
My mother

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.260
and Ying

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.140
have never done you any wrong.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.500
So why are you so cruel?

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.260
Today,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.450
since I heard the truth from your own mouth,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.530
if I don't kill you,

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.980
I don't deserve to live!

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.340
Well?

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.740
Are you going to rebel too?

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.980
The show's over,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.500
time for the curtain to fall.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.650
Prince of Yuzhang has colluded with a heretical sect

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.170
and is plotting treason!

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.900
Prince of Yuzhang is plotting treason!

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.620
Prince of Yuzhang is plotting treason!

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.900
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.220
Zhong Lin...

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.930
She bears Heartbane.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.170
A princess personally titled by His Majesty,

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.220
and future consort of Prince of Yuzhang,

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.100
turns out to be from the Lingbi Sect.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.410
How amusing.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.260
Are you still going to resist in vain?

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.980
Why not kneel and beg me now?

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.220
Maybe I'll even show you mercy.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.100
I,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.650
Prince of Yuzhang,

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.380
am the only heir of the Xiao dynasty.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.690
Du Tingxin,

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.810
think very carefully.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.050
If you kill me,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.100
what will happen to you?

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.980
The only heir?

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.140
You'd better think instead

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.340
how to hand Great Qi over to me properly.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.340
Dream on!

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:33.450
Let her go,

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:36.340
and I'll give you...

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.220
Xiao Qianqing, you're far too naive.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.860
What right do you have to bargain with me?

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.170
- Zhong Lin... - Move!

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.100
- Xiao Qianqing! - Zhong Lin!

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.220
Xiao Huan...

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.380
Now the whole Xiao clan is in my hands.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.290
Do you know

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.930
how long I've waited

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.170
for this very day?

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.050
Lately, disasters have kept striking Great Qi.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.450
So I plan to hold a Heaven-worship ceremony

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.410
in three days

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.450
to offer sacrifices

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.690
and welcome a new beginning.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.530
How dare you harbor such ambition!

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.930
Offer sacrifice

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.770
and welcome a new beginning...

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.290
what are you really after?

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.050
Without a rightful emperor,

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.410
how can any ceremony be held?

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.740
Haven't you already guessed?

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.500
You wouldn't dare!

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.410
Why wouldn't I?

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:06.860
Because...

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.170
I also carry the Xiao bloodline.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.530
So of course I can.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.980
Nonsense!

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.140
That father-emperor you all revere

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.930
is nothing but scum.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.930
Xiao Huan is dead,

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.570
and you

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.340
are bound by my Prison of Thousand Threads.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.140
Now, in the Xiao clan,

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.340
only I can shoulder the weight of this realm.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.650
Isn't that so?

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.140
You...

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.450
Once the ceremony is over,

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.690
I'll return Zhong Lin to you.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:58.290
But by then,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.770
whether she'll still want

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.980
to be with a heartless puppet like you

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.050
is another question.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.540
[Taiji Hall]

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.100
Do you think resisting the Moon-Eclipse's fusion

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.570
will keep it from eating you alive?

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.570
You're celebrating way too soon.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.450
It's useless.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.860
Only I can undo the Moon-Eclipse inside you.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.770
You'll never escape my grasp.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.930
Around twenty years ago,

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.900
were you ever in the Central Plains?

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.140
Around twenty years ago,

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.100
were you ever in Great Qi?

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.860
You were soft-hearted toward your enemies.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.340
This is the price you pay!

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.380
But you're my mother.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:15.490
Mother?

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.100
Who are you calling your mother?

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.100
Looks like the Moon-Eclipse

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.540
has ruined your brain.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.450
I have nothing to do with you at all.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.100
The Moon-Eclipse in my body

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.140
is being dispelled...

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.860
It's the king of poisons,

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.450
fed on the lifeblood of Saintesses.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.210
I'm using my inner force

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.690
to help purge your poison.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:20.970
Why escaped?

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.010
You don't want it removed?

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:30.100
The Moon-Eclipse

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.210
cannot be removed.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.300
Why not?

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.930
Even if

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.690
I have to endure its torment forever,

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.540
I can't let my mother

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.860
trade her life for mine.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.860
How do you know that?

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.540
The Moon-Eclipse

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.900
was fed on a Saintess's lifeblood.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:57.450
There's no other way.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:58.820
And curing it

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.930
naturally means life for life.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.620
So you knew?

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.410
You knew everything?

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:09.820
Yes.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.340
I also know

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.650
you've long regained all your memories.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.300
You wouldn't acknowledge me

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.170
because you'd already resolved

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.250
to sacrifice yourself

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.540
to cure my poison.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.620
Mother...

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.140
seeing you again

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.860
is life's greatest kindness to me.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:34.160
If curing the poison

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.900
means losing you again,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.340
I'd rather live my whole life with it.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.210
Huan,

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.060
it's been twenty years.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:07.970
Have you been well?

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.490
I've missed you so much.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.780
Mother,

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.620
you finally accept me.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.340
Silly child...

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.140
It's my fault

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.650
you suffered so much.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.580
If I could start all over again,

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.780
I would never let any of this happen.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:52.780
Twenty years ago,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.490
I wandered in the Central Plains.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.380
He saved my life.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.650
Back then I had no idea who he really was,

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.620
so we travelled the martial world together.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.580
Not long after,

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.690
I broke my sect's rules

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.170
and pledged my life to him.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.060
He said he would marry me

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.650
and take only me.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.010
But I never expected

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:21.860
he was actually the Emperor of Great Qi.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.380
When I was carrying his child, I was framed.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.820
My child

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.170
was born with a cold illness.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.250
From that moment on,

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.410
I had nothing but disappointment

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.140
in the palace

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:38.060
and in your father.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.620
All I wanted was to leave the palace

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.650
and find a cure for your cold illness.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.690
But later, the Lingbi Sect's secret arts

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.210
made me forget everything.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:53.650
So much has passed.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.620
One wrong step

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.340
leads to another.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.860
With the late Emperor,

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.780
our end was tragic,

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.860
but my conscience is clear.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.250
Only with you,

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.860
I failed to protect you

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.450
and that is my deepest regret.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.580
But I'm also relieved,

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.140
because you are far more courageous

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.970
and responsible than I imagined.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.170
Huan,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.540
all these years,

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.970
you've suffered so much.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.060
Mother,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.690
I'm not suffering.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.620
I've been doing very well.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.730
You were born with this cold illness.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.930
Left alone in the palace,

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.410
Empress Liu must've tormented you in every way.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:03.900
You had no one to turn to.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.780
Just to protect yourself,

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.210
you had to seek refuge with Grand Tutor Ling.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.010
I can imagine

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.210
how bitter and miserable

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.410
that must have been.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.970
How could you be doing well?

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:26.930
But now,

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.340
I'm back.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.490
You don't have to bear it all alone anymore.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.010
I know

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.210
about Du Tingxin's rebellion.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.210
Leave it to me.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:41.490
Mother,

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:43.340
this matter

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.340
should still be handled by me.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.620
All these years,

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.010
as the Saintess of the Lingbi Sect,

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:53.970
I've done many wrongs.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.650
Huan,

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.450
you should give me a chance

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:01.690
to atone.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:06.900
Mother,

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.690
you were trapped by their secret arts.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.210
None of this

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.300
was what you truly wanted.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.620
Huan,

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.580
are you hiding something from me?

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:24.370
Du Tingxin has taken away

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.100
all of the Heartbane from the Heartless Willow.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.250
Since I made her Imperial Preceptor,

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.730
it is my responsibility

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.340
to restore peace to Great Qi.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.490
You plan to unleash the Moon-Eclipse's full power?

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:37.490
You must not!

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.300
Huan,

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.930
your body simply can't take it.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.060
The Moon-Eclipse will shatter your heart

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.100
and invade your mind.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.620
Even if you keep your life,

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.380
you'll lose your senses

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.340
and know only killing!

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.620
Mother,

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.540
I've already made up my mind.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:11.900
Huan,

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.250
I know you carry Great Qi

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.010
and its people in your heart.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.900
But what about yourself?

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.780
Have you ever thought of yourself?

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.300
This elixir is refined from Ice Lotus.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:49.780
It can bring you back to life.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.650
It'll save your life

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.210
in a critical moment.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.300
Madam,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.140
everything for the ceremony is ready.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.170
Prince of Yuzhang and Zhong Lin are both in my hands now,

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.250
but that Ling Cangcang

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.210
keeps ruining my plans.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:25.140
And the ceremony

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.490
is the most important day of my life.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.860
Xiao Huan...

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.170
How could I hold it

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.380
without Her Majesty?

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.690
We've spread

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.380
the news that Zhong Lin was captured.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.620
The Empress will show herself soon enough...

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.970
But I can't wait another moment!

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.930
Our dear Princess Zhong Lin

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.780
was personally titled by His Majesty

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.140
and is the Empress's closest friend.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.250
Hang her on the city gate.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.730
Let's wait for Ling Cangcang

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:17.650
to show up.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.060
Prince of Yuzhang has been bound by Prison of Thousand Threads.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.140
And Princess Zhong Lin

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.170
is accused of colluding with the Lingbi Sect

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.380
and displayed on the city gate.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.820
She knows I'll show up.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.730
Well, I'll do as she wishes.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.650
Your Majesty,

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.900
they're doing this

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.780
just to lure you into their trap.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:46.650
Let's see

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.820
who ends up in whose trap.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.740
[Suqing Gate]

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.340
Even your imperial brother

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.100
can't possibly make it back alive!

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:24.700
[Suqing Gate]

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.010
Someone's rescuing her!

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.860
Zhong Lin, are you all right?

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.540
Go find Xiao Qianqing.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.340
Tell him

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.300
Xiao Huan is still alive.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.300
Go, now!

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.690
We go together or not at all.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:57.410
Don't worry.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:58.490
I have my own plan.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.440
Cangcang...

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.100
Get her out of here!

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:01.410
- Move! - Cangcang...

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:02.380
- Hurry! - Cangcang!

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.620
Cangcang!

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:40.340
Madam, bad news!

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.780
Speak.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.490
Ling Cangcang has rescued Zhong Lin.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:48.490
She also sent people to raid the secret treasury.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.340
They robbed the Lingbi Sect's funds and grain?

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.210
Ling Cangcang is asking for death!

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.690
Find her.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:56.490
Yes.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.540
Your mother is dead.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.580
Your sister is dead.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.060
Even your imperial brother

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.930
can't possibly make it back alive!

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:13.930
Anyone poisoned with this

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.970
will slowly lose consciousness within ten days.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.340
Tell me,

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:21.210
isn't that clever?

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.140
Xiao Qianqing!

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:53.970
Are you all right?

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:55.100
It's just a scratch.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.170
It's nothing.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.620
What about you?

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.380
How are you?

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.060
I'm fine too.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.580
What is it?

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:06.340
What happened to you?

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:08.490
What's wrong?

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:10.540
Take care.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.780
Zhong Lin...

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:24.300
Lately,

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.100
I keep dreaming about Xiao Huan,

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:29.930
about when we were children.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.250
In the dream he asks me...

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.620
why I didn't trust him.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.580
No matter how I cry,

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:41.730
apologize,

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:44.690
and beg him not to go,

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.100
he still throws himself off Phoenix Terrace.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.210
I've never hated myself this much.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.620
I'm the killer...

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.300
I killed him with my own hands.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.140
No, you didn't.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.580
His Majesty isn't dead.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.340
What did you say?

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.100
Cangcang told me.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.300
It's absolutely true.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.450
I knew it.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.690
There's no way he'd die that easily.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.210
He must be planning to strike back.

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.340
When he returns...

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.650
Prison of Thousand Threads...

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.300
Du Tingxin planted it in you!

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.140
She means to control you!

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.060
Zhong Lin...

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.730
It has already reached my heart.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.620
I'm afraid I'll hurt you.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:59.010
I once wanted you close,

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.900
but now I'm setting you free.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.210
Go far away,

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:06.450
and never come back.

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:09.660
You fool...

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:23.380
Zhong Lin,

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:26.180
I have one last request.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.090
Will you

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.900
help me once more?

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:36.970
Even a thousand times,

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:39.490
I'd still say yes.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.490
All right.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.820
Greetings,

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:22.490
Your Majesty.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.490
You've suffered too.

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:32.260
Your Majesty,

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:34.660
I came here

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.490
to return this to you.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.010
I will not take back

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:45.740
what I've given away.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.220
What are you going to do?

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.930
The elite troops from Southern Chu have arrived,

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:59.260
waiting for my command.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.010
You want to kill Du Tingxin?

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.660
You're under the Prison of Thousand Threads.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.570
If you kill her, you'll die too!

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.900
So what?

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.860
There's my mother and Ying to avenge,

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.450
and you as well.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.090
Even if it costs me my life,

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:19.490
I still have to kill her.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:21.260
Do you trust me?

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:28.970
I do.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.450
Then don't act rashly.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.220
Leave this to me.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.490
I don't want you risking yourself again.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.490
What I've hated most

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.490
is being born imperial.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:46.410
I hate that you always outshine me,

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:47.380
still,

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.530
I hope we can be brothers again in the next life.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.450
Next time,

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.530
I'll be the older brother

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.530
and I'll protect you.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.050
Madam,

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.340
Fenglai Pavilion's covert base should be here.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.220
But we couldn't find the entrance.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.380
They always act with great caution.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.570
On the surface, it's an abandoned post station.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.300
But underground,

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.530
there must be more to it.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.180
Search it.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.410
Yes, Madam!

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.180
Search!

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.930
Here's a secret tunnel!

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.340
Out!

00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.570
Everyone out!

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.010
Freeze!

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:04.970
Move!

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:13.530
Move!

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.740
Bring them out.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.130
- Bring them out! - Yes, sir!

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.260
Your Majesty,

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.900
it's been a while.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.930
You used to be so high and mighty.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:27.380
But without Xiao Huan,

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.340
you're just a rat in the dark,

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.130
hiding from the sun.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.300
From the looks of it,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.130
you're here to end it all?

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.930
Go ahead.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.220
Ling Cangcang,

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.130
[Linghe Hall]
you've fallen into my hands after all.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.220
The dignified Empress has become my prisoner.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.660
You really do look quite pathetic.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.700
How does the torture feel?

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.260
Kill me or torture me,

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.930
do as you please.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.700
You're already my prisoner,

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.490
yet you're still so defiant?

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:17.490
I really want to see

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.900
how long you can keep that mouth tough.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.180
Lately I've discovered

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.180
a most interesting punishment.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.380
You'll be nailed up and burned with incense for seven days,

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:31.090
one stick a day.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:33.490
And on the seventh day,

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:36.380
I'll reward you with an ice spike.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.930
If you're lucky

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.660
and it pierces your heart,

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.050
freezing your blood in its tracks,

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:42.740
you'll be stuck between life and death.

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:45.220
No...

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.970
to be precise,

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.860
you'll live like a walking corpse.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.050
With this lamp's effect,

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.110
you'll bleed endlessly.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.260
But don't worry.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.930
Before the final day comes,

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:14.610
I won't let you die.

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:18.380
Come on then.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.090
Do it.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.740
Ling Cangcang,

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.930
I don't care at all

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:29.130
what you say now.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.860
Because you're in my hands.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.050
One day you'll beg me

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.410
to grant you a quick death!

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.220
Your Majesty,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.900
you'd better behave.

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:55.780
Nail her up.

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.570
Don't let her die.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:59.490
I still need her to witness

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.490
my moment of glory.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.780
Yes, Madam.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.970
Everyone,

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:39.010
I am

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:40.410
the Emperor of Great Qi,

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:41.180
Xiao Huan.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:48.970
His Majesty is wise and mighty,

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.260
kind and benevolent.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.510
But we have committed grave sins

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.770
and must be punished.

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:54.530
[One with Heaven and Earth]

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:55.340
All sect members

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.490
shall serve five years of hard labour

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.490
to atone for our crimes.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.180
We thank Your Majesty for your grace!

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.740
From this day on,

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.450
the Lingbi Sect no longer exists.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.740
All of you must return to the right path,

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:12.700
protect the weak

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.090
and uphold justice.

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.610
From now on,

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:18.050
cut all ties with Nanrong Palace.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:19.260
No offender

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:20.930
will be forgiven!

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:21.610
Yes, Your Majesty!

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.800
[Yaoqing Hall]

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.900
Lately I've been busy with the ceremony

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.450
and neglected Your Highness.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.900
My mistake.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.740
I heard you left your manor yesterday.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:56.930
Who did you meet?

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.300
You think I had no way to deal with you?

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.780
You still dare resist?

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:21.970
Looks like

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:23.090
the Prison of Thousand Threads

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.050
are working slowly on you.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:31.660
Madam.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.050
Madam.

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:41.900
Madam.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:42.900
Madam,

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.700
the Saintess has been deposed,

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.300
and the Ghost King now controls the Lingbi Sect.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.300
Seems this Ghost King

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:51.820
really is quite capable.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.530
He...

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.410
he's actually...

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:56.820
Out with it!

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:58.570
He is the Emperor of Great Qi.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:02.450
So you really are still alive!
