00:16.860 --> 00:17.820
We've arrived.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.410
Hm? Where's King?

00:24.660 --> 00:26.290
He should've been at the rear.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.370
I saw him running off.

00:28.710 --> 00:32.630
<i>I'm gonna go to my position early,</i>
<i>so don't worry about me.</i>

00:32.710 --> 00:35.710
<i>Everyone should stick to</i>
<i>your scheduled timing for the assault.</i>

00:36.090 --> 00:37.220
That's what he said.

00:37.380 --> 00:41.340
<i>He acts on his own like it's nothing.</i>

00:41.680 --> 00:43.810
<i>Why didn't he tell me directly?</i>

00:44.640 --> 00:46.730
<i>Am I still being treated like a kid?</i>

00:47.020 --> 00:49.230
He acts fast.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.980
That's just how he is.

00:52.230 --> 00:55.570
I was hoping to see King
in action up close.

00:55.610 --> 00:56.650
What a shame.

00:56.820 --> 00:59.490
He has his own way
of doing things.

00:59.650 --> 01:00.490
Yeah.

01:00.570 --> 01:01.450
Hey...

01:02.200 --> 01:03.740
Check out what's ahead.

01:04.780 --> 01:07.160
Looks like they're rolling out
the welcome party for us.

01:07.330 --> 01:09.790
Whoa... They just keep showing up.

01:10.210 --> 01:13.250
Master Atomic,
I sense them behind us too.

01:13.630 --> 01:15.710
Not just behind us.

01:25.350 --> 01:26.350
<i>An old rag...?</i>

01:35.860 --> 01:36.780
Damn that Gyoro-Gyoro.

01:36.900 --> 01:40.110
He said he wouldn't pull any tricks,
yet this was a trap all along?!

01:48.500 --> 01:54.420
The heat signatures surrounding us
has exceeded 80...110...150.

01:54.540 --> 01:55.670
And still rising.

01:55.790 --> 01:57.840
Enough with the toys, Child Emperor.

01:58.210 --> 02:00.880
There's no point in counting them.

02:01.010 --> 02:03.680
Any boys lacking confidence,
just stay behind me!

02:04.800 --> 02:06.390
Well, well...

02:06.890 --> 02:08.430
Oh my...

02:08.430 --> 02:12.270
I heard the Hero Association
was sending in its full fighting force

02:12.270 --> 02:13.900
but this is it?

03:43.990 --> 03:47.740
{\an8}COUNTERSTRIKE

03:45.900 --> 03:49.240
What you should be counting...
are your sins.

04:06.220 --> 04:07.380
This phenomenon...

04:08.090 --> 04:09.180
Is it psychic power?!

04:10.300 --> 04:11.720
Grudges...

04:14.270 --> 04:18.600
These eyes belong to the monsters
killed by heroes.

04:18.980 --> 04:23.440
I was a weak psychic,
but Gyoro-Gyoro implanted these into me.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.690
By harnessing the remnants
of their lingering grudges

04:25.690 --> 04:28.570
my strength was amplified.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.740
Now that the time for
vengeance has come...

04:32.830 --> 04:35.040
they are all weeping!

04:50.680 --> 04:51.550
What on earth?!

04:51.720 --> 04:53.180
That's Tornado's barrier.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.140
Thank you very much, Tornado...

04:55.520 --> 04:57.100
Noooo!

04:57.390 --> 05:00.810
Hey Tornado!
Protect us till the end!

05:03.520 --> 05:04.400
Tornado?

05:05.110 --> 05:08.150
Why should I protect all of you?

05:08.490 --> 05:09.370
What?!

05:09.610 --> 05:10.490
Take cover.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.950
Angel Fwip-Fwap.

05:14.450 --> 05:15.290
- Wow!
- Wow!

05:15.290 --> 05:17.250
Hey, you two. Careful.

05:20.540 --> 05:22.290
{\an8}BANG

05:29.470 --> 05:30.880
What's wrong, Tornado?!

05:30.970 --> 05:33.090
Why are you saying that at
this crucial moment?

05:33.340 --> 05:36.890
If you can't handle this yourselves,
then just leave right now.

05:36.890 --> 05:38.350
There's no point in being here.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.020
You're just in the way.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.270
I agree.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.860
Wow! That's rare!

05:45.480 --> 05:49.400
Their role isn’t to be a burden,
but support, isn’t it?

05:50.490 --> 05:53.820
They knew exactly what
they were stepping into.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.450
You're supposed to be support too...

05:56.910 --> 06:00.620
Don't tell me you're too scared
to move?

06:01.250 --> 06:03.210
If you guys are heroes...

06:03.830 --> 06:05.790
Then show me what you're made of.

06:08.210 --> 06:11.420
Even with that power boost
gathered from low-life energies

06:11.420 --> 06:13.510
this is clearly your limit.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.930
Give it up.

06:15.510 --> 06:17.930
I hear your younger sister
is also a psychic.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.640
I just had a great idea.

06:22.190 --> 06:25.270
I'll gouge out the eyes
of you and your sister...

06:26.810 --> 06:29.320
Fusing them together would be
an interesting experiment.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.690
You sure talk a lot
for a garbage bag.

06:31.820 --> 06:34.610
Fine... Looks like I need to teach you
a little something.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.280
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

06:37.700 --> 06:40.750
This is what happens
when you mess with us!

06:41.120 --> 06:42.250
Ridiculous.

06:52.050 --> 06:54.300
So this is the Terrible Tornado...

06:56.430 --> 06:59.850
- They're scared!
- Get 'em!

06:59.850 --> 07:00.720
Yahh!

07:02.600 --> 07:03.680
Don't underestimate us!

07:04.020 --> 07:07.400
We're more than capable

can stop bullets and use barriers

07:24.000 --> 07:26.290
is distracted and acting stupid

07:26.290 --> 07:30.170

even sharing
my nervous system with them.

07:51.940 --> 07:54.110
Now's your chance to finish them off.

07:54.110 --> 07:54.990
Got it!

08:51.790 --> 08:53.170
I'm not like you.

08:55.050 --> 08:59.470
Indeed. There were
no women where I trained.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.430
They're better than I thought.

09:01.590 --> 09:03.680
I guess there's no need to worry.

Yes, they're all Class-A heroes.

09:05.890 --> 09:09.600

10:47.990 --> 10:49.660
Nice muscles.

10:50.330 --> 10:52.120
Yeah, thank you.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.960
But aside from track and field,
all I can do is grapple.

11:01.670 --> 11:02.510
Whoa!

11:02.510 --> 11:04.930
Yuck! I squeezed too hard.

11:05.510 --> 11:07.680
Be sure not to overstrain your muscles.

11:07.930 --> 11:10.890
I'll do my best so you guys
can conserve your stamina.

11:12.640 --> 11:15.270

11:40.460 --> 11:41.960
It was an elegant victory.

11:42.170 --> 11:43.550
Something doesn't feel right.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.470
The enemy was too weak.

11:46.510 --> 11:49.890
They sent in the underlings
even though they knew they'd lose.

11:50.220 --> 11:52.850
Their aim can't just be to wear us down.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.640
Don't let your guard down!

11:54.770 --> 11:56.310
There's more on the way!

11:58.770 --> 12:00.560
They look a little stronger?

12:00.650 --> 12:02.150
Outta the way! I'll handle this.

We won't need help from Orochi
or our leaders.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.550
He's tougher than I expected.

13:08.670 --> 13:11.220
I tried to pierce through

13:11.550 --> 13:13.390
You moron. Aim for his heart!

13:13.510 --> 13:17.140
I'll give your shooting...

Is that all you got, heroes?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.040

a few of our grunts with
that same trait. However...

14:36.930 --> 14:39.310

I'll take it from here.

Now's not the time
for your stubbornness.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.110
You've become obsessed with
cutting his horn, haven't you?

14:50.860 --> 14:51.780
I'll cut him down.

14:52.360 --> 14:53.400
Cut me down?!

14:53.530 --> 14:56.320
Didn't you just watch me fight?

14:57.120 --> 14:59.950
Well, at least
you get credit for having guts.

15:00.450 --> 15:02.250
A-Atomic Samurai!

15:02.620 --> 15:04.750
Blades don't work on that monster.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.880
He'll destroy them both.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Hit me with your best shot!

15:09.380 --> 15:11.590
I'll give you a score!

15:14.590 --> 15:16.550
All right. We're done here.

15:17.140 --> 15:20.680
Let's move on.
Everyone still on their feet?

15:20.930 --> 15:23.600
Huh? We're far from done here.

15:23.930 --> 15:27.190
Hey, don't ignore me!

15:27.400 --> 15:28.270
Huh?

15:28.480 --> 15:30.770
Oh right...

15:31.070 --> 15:32.150
So what's my score?

15:37.110 --> 15:41.330
So frustrating...Dammit...
Gyoro-Gyoro...

15:44.580 --> 15:48.960
So, Gyoro-Gyoro.
What threat level am I at now?

15:49.590 --> 15:51.210
Am I still a Tiger?

15:51.380 --> 15:54.470
When we first met,
you were definitely a Tiger.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.840
But now, you are a Demon.

15:57.010 --> 16:00.180
I can't wait to see you fight.

16:02.010 --> 16:03.970
But you said...

16:04.480 --> 16:09.310
I was strong...
You said I could beat Class-S heroes...

16:10.060 --> 16:12.070
You lied to me.

16:13.730 --> 16:15.360
100 points...

16:16.740 --> 16:18.240
Thank you.

16:21.030 --> 16:22.580
He got Rhino-Wrestler.

16:22.620 --> 16:23.790
How?

16:23.790 --> 16:26.460
No idea. But his only weapon
is a single blade.

16:26.910 --> 16:28.920
If we all attack at once,
we can kill him.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.960
He must be their strongest.

16:40.840 --> 16:45.020
I don't think there's enough of you
to take me on.

16:46.140 --> 16:47.640
Wow...

16:48.850 --> 16:51.400
Oh, there's more of you?

16:51.810 --> 16:54.650
Fine, I'll kill you all.

16:59.570 --> 17:02.320
Playtime is over. Get to work.

17:05.290 --> 17:08.040
<i>That was so fast.</i>
<i>I couldn't even see what he did.</i>

17:08.369 --> 17:10.369
<i>This is Flash's quick technique?</i>

17:11.130 --> 17:13.460
Even killing one will make us look good.

17:13.540 --> 17:16.089
- Go after the weak ones.
- Yeah!!

17:16.210 --> 17:17.589
Yikes, they're after me!

17:17.970 --> 17:19.339
No worries! Bring it on!

17:20.589 --> 17:22.510
Huh? Blackluster?

17:23.390 --> 17:25.810
Are you tired?
You should rest a little.

17:26.220 --> 17:29.350
In front of you! Look in front of you!
They're attacking.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.480
Give your muscles a break.

17:38.650 --> 17:41.780
He's crushing the monsters
by ramming into them!

17:42.280 --> 17:44.530
Just what kind of training do you do?

17:47.910 --> 17:49.540
My turn now.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.290
Stay back, everyone—

18:10.600 --> 18:12.100
Did you see that, boys?

18:12.770 --> 18:13.770
It's okay...

18:15.110 --> 18:16.480
to fall for me.

18:17.780 --> 18:19.360
{\an8}WHOOSH

18:19.360 --> 18:21.030
Hey, you're all too far away.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.790
He must really hate you.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.870
To still keep his shape
after fighting Tornado.

18:32.370 --> 18:33.460
You think so?

18:35.630 --> 18:37.960
I didn't really notice.

18:42.260 --> 18:43.550
Hmm...

18:45.050 --> 18:45.930
Found you!

18:47.850 --> 18:49.520
No more spying!

18:50.310 --> 18:51.730
I've already seen enough.

18:51.890 --> 18:54.810
Although I wish
I were able to see King fighting.

18:55.230 --> 18:59.230
Ahh, I see.
I think I got it figured out now.

19:00.530 --> 19:03.320
I was just getting in the mood to kill,
why did you summon me?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.620
So? What exactly have you figured out?

19:08.990 --> 19:11.700
All right! We've taken care of
all the monsters that appeared.

19:12.790 --> 19:15.370
The surface team will now
stand by at the central point.

19:15.540 --> 19:18.670
Leave the rest to us.
It's almost time.

19:19.130 --> 19:22.550
All assault teams in position,
begin advancing.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.880
Let me remind you that the top priority
is to rescue the hostage.

19:26.180 --> 19:27.720
Don't expect any backup.

19:27.850 --> 19:30.140
Whatever happens,
you're on your own.

19:30.180 --> 19:33.390
Excuse me!
Can someone give me a hand?

19:34.890 --> 19:37.730
Pig God is stuck!

19:34.890 --> 19:37.810
{\an8}SQUEEZE

19:38.650 --> 19:39.610
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.900
{\an8}RUMBLE

19:43.360 --> 19:44.360
I'm not stuck anymore.

19:44.700 --> 19:47.700
Master... Is this strategy wise?

19:47.910 --> 19:48.790
Huh?

19:49.030 --> 19:52.740
What? Any problem can be solved
with a slash of the blade.

19:52.950 --> 19:55.040
Okay, let's move on.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.500
Shall we go then?

19:57.250 --> 19:59.040
I-In any case...!

19:59.170 --> 20:01.130
I don't want any of you to die.

20:03.840 --> 20:08.550
You rushed out to gain victory.
Why have you returned?

20:08.840 --> 20:10.970
Did you kill any heroes?

20:11.140 --> 20:14.180
N-No... They were super strong and...

20:14.220 --> 20:16.770
Yeah, stronger than we expected.

20:16.890 --> 20:19.400
They're too much for us to handle.

20:19.650 --> 20:22.480
They've already killed
more than half of us.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.480
This is going in a bad direction.

20:24.650 --> 20:27.610
We thought numbers meant victory.
We were wrong.

20:27.740 --> 20:30.570
There's no way we're taking
such a dangerous risk.

20:30.910 --> 20:32.530
You don't want to die?

20:32.620 --> 20:34.870
Like hell I'd die so easily!

20:34.910 --> 20:37.750
We joined the
Monster Association to wreak havoc.

20:37.960 --> 20:42.090
I see. In that case,
you have no reason to exist.

20:42.210 --> 20:43.590
This is where you die.

20:46.840 --> 20:50.090
Huh? Wait! Gyoro-Gyoro!

20:50.260 --> 20:51.510
We can't stop it!

20:51.640 --> 20:53.060
Get away!

20:53.510 --> 20:54.680
{\an8}SQUISH

20:55.810 --> 21:00.770
If you cannot even lose,
I will feed you to Lord Orochi.

21:03.480 --> 21:07.030
Must the leaders and
Demon-level monsters do everything?

21:07.150 --> 21:08.990
If you don't want to end up
as cubes of meat

21:08.990 --> 21:12.410
then risk your lives and
get some intel on the enemy.

21:13.910 --> 21:17.500
What are you staring at?
Get going!

21:18.250 --> 21:21.880
I already instructed each of you
on which Class-S heroes to target.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.380
The fact remains,
the odds are still in our favor.

21:24.590 --> 21:26.670
Don’t flinch at mere humans.

21:26.880 --> 21:27.760
Go!

23:16.490 --> 23:19.120
Looks like everyone made it in safely.

23:19.490 --> 23:22.080
The ending felt a bit too quick.

23:22.290 --> 23:25.210
That's because those guys
are Class-S heroes.

23:25.330 --> 23:28.130
Ordinary monsters don't stand
a chance against them.

23:28.290 --> 23:29.800
Yeah, I get that but...

23:30.170 --> 23:33.090
Hmm... He's got a point.

23:33.510 --> 23:35.930
Considering how elaborate
the trap was

23:35.930 --> 23:38.640
they sure let us in pretty easily.

23:39.050 --> 23:41.680
I hope the senior heroes are okay.

23:41.810 --> 23:43.730
Whatever happens, happens.

23:43.850 --> 23:48.520
All the Class-S heroes have powers
that are beyond human comprehension.

23:52.070 --> 23:54.190
The real fight starts now.

23:55.900 --> 24:00.780
{\an8}NINJA TALE
